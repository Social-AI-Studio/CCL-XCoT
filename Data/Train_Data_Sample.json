            "Why India is Riskier than China NEW HAVEN – Today, fears are growing that China and India are about to be the next victims of the ongoing global economic carnage. This would have enormous consequences. Asia’s developing and newly industrialized economies grew at an 8.5% average annual rate over 2010-11 – nearly triple the 3% growth elsewhere in the world. If China and India are next to fall, Asia would be at risk, and it would be hard to avoid a global recession. In one important sense, these concerns are understandable: both economies depend heavily on the broader global climate. China is sensitive to downside risks to external demand – more relevant than ever since crisis-torn Europe and the United States collectively accounted for 38% of total exports in 2010. But India, with its large current-account deficit and external funding needs, is more exposed to tough conditions in global financial markets. Yet fears of hard landings for both economies are overblown, especially regarding China. Yes, China is paying a price for aggressive economic stimulus undertaken in the depths of the subprime crisis. The banking system funded the bulk of the additional spending, and thus is exposed to any deterioration in credit quality that may have arisen from such efforts. There are also concerns about frothy property markets and mounting inflation. While none of these problems should be minimized, they are unlikely to trigger a hard landing. Long fixated on stability, Chinese policymakers have been quick to take preemptive action. That is particularly evident in Chinese officials’ successful campaign against inflation. Administrative measures in the agricultural sector, aimed at alleviating supply bottlenecks for pork, cooking oil, fresh vegetables, and fertilizer, have pushed food-price inflation lower. This is the main reason why the headline consumer inflation rate receded from 6.5% in July 2011 to 4.2% in November. Meanwhile, the People’s Bank of China, which hiked benchmark one-year lending rates five times in the 12 months ending this October, to 6.5%, now has plenty of scope for monetary easing should economic conditions deteriorate. The same is true with mandatory reserves in the banking sector, where the government has already pruned 50 basis points off the record 21.5% required-reserve ratio. Relatively small fiscal deficits – only around 2% of GDP in 2010 – leave China with an added dimension of policy flexibility should circumstances dictate. Nor has China been passive with respect to mounting speculative excesses in residential property. In April 2010, it implemented tough new regulations, raising down-payments from 20% to 30% for a first home, to 50% for a second residence, and to 100% for purchases of three or more units. This strategy appears to be working. In November, house prices declined in 49 of the 70 cities that China monitors monthly. Moreover, it is a serious exaggeration to claim, as many do today, that the Chinese economy is one massive real-estate bubble. Yes, total fixed investment is approaching an unprecedented 50% of GDP, but residential and nonresidential real estate, combined, accounts for only 15-20% of that – no more than 10% of the overall economy. In terms of floor space, residential construction accounts for half of China’s real-estate investment. Identifying the share of residential real estate that goes to private developers in the dozen or so first-tier cities (which account for most of the Chinese property market’s fizz) suggests that less than 1% of GDP would be at risk in the event of a housing-market collapse – not exactly a recipe for a hard landing. As for Chinese banks, the main problem appears to be exposure to ballooning local-government debt, which, according to the government, totaled $1.7 trillion (roughly 30% of GDP) at the end of 2010. Approximately half of this debt was on their books prior to the crisis. Some of the new debt that resulted from the stimulus could well end up being impaired, but ongoing urbanization – around 15-20 million people per year move to cities – provides enormous support on the demand side for investment in infrastructure development and residential and commercial construction. That tempers the risks to credit quality and, along with relatively low loan-to-deposit ratios of around 65%, should cushion the Chinese banking system. India is more problematic. As the only economy in Asia with a current-account deficit, its external funding problems can hardly be taken lightly. Like China, India’s economic-growth momentum is ebbing. But unlike China, the downshift is more pronounced – GDP growth fell through the 7% threshold in the third calendar-year quarter of 2011, and annual industrial output actually fell by 5.1% in October. But the real problem is that, in contrast to China, Indian authorities have far less policy leeway. For starters, the rupee is in near free-fall. That means that the Reserve Bank of India – which has hiked its benchmark policy rate 13 times since the start of 2010 to deal with a still-serious inflation problem – can ill afford to ease monetary policy. Moreover, an outsize consolidated government budget deficit of around 9% of GDP limits India’s fiscal-policy discretion. While China is in better shape than India, neither economy is likely to implode on its own. It would take another shock to trigger a hard landing in Asia. One obvious possibility today would be a disruptive breakup of the European Monetary Union. In that case, both China and India, like most of the world’s economies, could find themselves in serious difficulty – with an outright contraction of Chinese exports, as in late 2008 and early 2009, and heightened external funding pressures for India. While I remain a euro-skeptic, I believe that the political will to advance European integration will prevail. Consequently, I attach a low probability to the currency union’s disintegration. Barring such a worst-case outcome for Europe, the odds of a hard landing in either India or China should remain low. Seduced by the political economy of false prosperity, the West has squandered its might. Driven by strategy and stability, Asia has built on its newfound strength. But now it must reinvent itself. Japanese-like stagnation in the developed world is challenging externally dependent Asia to shift its focus to internal demand. Downside pressures currently squeezing China and India underscore that challenge. Asia’s defining moment could be hand.",
            "为什么印度风险高于中国 纽黑文 — — 今天，中印两国将成为当前全球经济大屠杀下一个受害者的担忧正越来越强。 这将产生严重的后果。 亚洲发展中国家及新兴工业化经济体2010－2011年度经济平均年增长速度为8.5 % — —接近世界其他地方3%的三倍之多。 如果中印两国经济下滑，亚洲将会陷入危险之中，而且全球经济衰退也将很难避免。 从中印经济严重依赖于总体全球环境这个重要意义上，这样的担心是可以理解的。 中国对外部需求的下行风险十分敏感 — — 受危机蹂躏的欧洲和美国共同占据了2010年度出口总额的38 % 。 而印度则因其庞大的经常账户赤字和外部资金需求而更多地受到全球金融市场的影响。 但是两国经济硬着陆的担忧被过分夸大，特别是关于中国。 的确，中国正在为其在次贷危机中激进的经济刺激政策而付出代价。 大部分额外支出来自于银行系统，银行因此可能出现由上述措施所导致的信贷质量恶化。 此外还存在有关房地产市场泡沫化和通胀持续攀升的担忧。 尽管上述任何问题都不容小觑，但它们引发经济硬着陆的可能性不大。 一直极端关注稳定的中国决策者已经迅速采取了预防性的行动。 最明显的一点是中国官员已经成功将通胀控制住。 政府在农业部门采取了旨在缓解猪肉、食用油、蔬菜和化肥等供应瓶颈的行政措施，并成功控制了食品价格的上涨。 整体消费通胀率也因此从2011年7月的6.5%下降到2011年11月的4.2 % 。 此外，中国人民银行在截止今年十月的12个月内将一年期贷款基准利率上调五倍至6.5 % ， 现在如果经济状况恶化，央行拥有足够的空间放松货币政策。 银行业强制储备金率也是如此。 政府已将处于创纪录高点的21.5%的强制准备金率调降了50个基点 — — 如果情况需要，中国还拥有更大的政策灵活度。 中国也对房地产愈演愈烈的过度投机采取了积极的对策。 2010年4月，中国实施了严厉的新政，将首次置业的首付比例从20%调高至30 % ， 二次置业提高至50 % ， 三次或更多次置业更是提高至100 % 。 这项政策似乎收到了效果。 11月，中国实行月度监控的70座城市中有49座出现了房价下降。 此外，今年很多人宣称中国经济是一个巨大的房地产泡沫，这是一种严重夸张的说法。 的确，全社会固定投资已前所未有地接近国内生产总值的50 % ， 但住宅及非住宅投资合计仅占其中15－20%的份额 — — 不超过经济总量的10 % 。 具体到楼面面积，住宅建设占据了中国房地产投资的半壁江山。 清理十几座一线城市（占中国房地产市场泡沫的绝大部分）私营开发商开发的住宅地产表明，如果房地产市场陷入崩溃，仅有GDP的百分之一将会受到威胁 — — 这并不会切实导致经济硬着陆。 至于中国的银行，主要问题似乎是地方政府债务膨胀带来的，根据政府数据，截止2010年底的地方政府债务总值达1.7万亿美元（约占GDP30%的份额 ） 。 大概近半数的政府债务是危机前遗留下来的。 刺激政策导致的一些新增债务可能出现问题，但每年约1500－2000万人进城的持续城市化进程为基础设施开发和住宅及商业建设投资提供了需求方面的支撑。 这些因素缓和了信贷质量的风险，加之65%左右的存贷比相对较低，应该可以为中国的银行系统提供必要的缓冲。 印度的问题相对严重。 作为亚洲唯一一个经常账户赤字的经济体，人们很难对它的外部融资问题掉以轻心。 和中国一样，印度的经济增长势头正在减弱。 但和中国不同的是，印度的下降势头更为显著 — — 2011年第三季度GDP增速低于7%的临界点，而10月年度工业总产值实际下降了5.1 % 。 但真正的问题是和中国相比，印度政府的政策回旋余地远没有那么大。 首先，卢比几乎陷入了自由落体。 这意味着从2010年伊始就开始上调基准政策利率13倍以应对依然严重的通胀局面的印度储备银行很难切实放松货币政策。 ���外，政府综合大规模预算赤字占到GDP的9%左右，这严重限制了印度财政政策的自由。 虽然中国的经济状况好于印度，但中印两国出现经济崩溃的可能性都不大。 如果没有进一步的经济冲击，亚洲地区不太可能出现经济硬着陆。 今天，欧洲货币联盟破坏性解体的可能性是切实存在的。 如果这种情况真的发生，中印两国和绝大多数世界经济体可能将面临严重的困难 — — 像2008年末及2009年初那样导致中国出口骤然减少和印度外部融资压力骤然增加。 虽然我仍对欧元持怀疑态度，但我相信推动欧洲融合的政治意愿将会占据上风。 因此，我认为货币联盟解体的可能性不大。 如果欧洲不出现这种最坏结果，那么印度或中国经济硬着陆的几率应该不大。 在政治经济虚假繁荣的引诱下，西方国家白白浪费了自己的力量。 而在战略及稳定的驱动下，亚洲国家的力量却得到了加强。 但现在亚洲必须实现自我重塑。 发达国家出现的日本式停滞正在挑战依赖外部需求的亚洲转向依赖内部需求。 正在挤压中国和印度的下行压力凸显了这一挑战。 亚洲正面临决定性的时刻。"

            "Why is China Booming? Providence, R.I. – China is now celebrating the 30th anniversary of the period officially known as “reform and opening.” Labeling time in this way echoes China’s imperial history. During moments of political transition – a military victory, for example – the emperor might designate a special “era name” to help celebrate the good news. Or the court might test out a new era name after a political debacle, in an effort to wipe the slate clean. The last emperor of the Tang Dynasty proclaimed seven era names in fourteen years, as he sought in vain to “re-brand” his reign and avoid his regime’s demise. Deng Xiaoping began to champion “reform and opening” in 1978. “Reform” suggested a loosening of central controls on economic life, undertaken in a spirit of pragmatism and gradualism, as an antidote to Mao Zedong’s ideology of “revolution.” Similarly, “opening” heralded the PRC’s integration into the world community – especially the capitalist West. Deng’s principles still guide policy today. One must go back to the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) and its 60-year era of “heavenly flourishing” ( Qianlong ) in the eighteenth century to find a comparable period of coherent political and economic policy. The era of “reform and opening” has outlived its “emperor” by more than a decade, and has been the common thread running through transfers of political authority from Deng to Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao. Even the largest popular challenge the Chinese Communist Party ever faced, the demonstrations of 1989, now looks like a blip that helped Deng consolidate support for his model of development. If one factor undergirds China’s commitment to “reform and opening,” it is the extraordinary macroeconomic changes of the past 30 years. In China, people call it fazhan , or “development,” but in much of rest of the world, it is more commonly described simply as the “China Boom,” or the “China Miracle.” The boom began in the countryside in the late 1970’s and 1980’s, and was followed by today’s urban, industrial-led growth. Indeed, there have been many smaller “booms” – in consumption, foreign direct investment, domestic stock markets, trade, travel, overseas study, military modernization, and international diplomacy. There is also a boom in pollution and toxic waste, and booming interest in religion – from Buddhism to Pentecostal Christianity – and in Confucian philosophy. Little in China today speaks of moderation. A leading fashion industry executive argues that a key engine driving the economic boom has been the influx of women into the workforce, particularly in the manufacturing zones of the south. Another compelling explanation comes from a venture capitalist who credits Chinese society with copious reserves of entrepreneurial energy that derives, he believes, from the fact that Chinese culture attaches very little shame to failing in a business enterprise. High tolerance for failure keeps everybody striving to succeed. Whatever the cause, the boom seems an unlikely capstone to a century of war, ferment, and revolution, and only adds to the sense of discontinuity that characterizes modern China. Certainly, few observers looking in 1978 at the smoldering embers of the Cultural Revolution, or at the seeming ruination of the post-1989 years, thought China would emerge as the lightning rod of the world’s developmental hopes. Paradoxically, the apparently discontinuous and contradictory nature of the “era of reform and opening” may actually help explain how China’s boom came about. The tumult of the Maoist period instilled in a broad cross-section of people a profound appreciation for stability, and a yearning to be left alone. Deng capitalized on this revolution-weariness by diminishing the role of politics and the state in people’s private lives and freeing them to release their pent-up energy to pursue their own goals. Revolutionary communism may well have cleared the path for the boom in other ways as well, suggesting that the shift from socialist utopianism to capitalist pragmatism was less a U-turn than a sequential process of “creative destruction.” After all, Mao’s Cultural Revolution against “feudal society” did raze much of the cultural landscape, denuding it not only of traditional values and institutions, but also of failed socialist efforts, leaving China ready for the seeds of capitalist development. Mao’s revolution fueled countless rectification movements and campaigns that inverted the once-inviolate primacy of ruler over ruled, scholar over worker, husband over wife, father over son, and family over individual. By the time of the reforms of the 1980’s and 1990’s, bonds tying individuals to culture, the state, the work unit, and household-registration systems, for example, had largely unraveled. The path had been cleared for a vast new population of atomized entrepreneurs and laborers, freed from fealty to family and Party, to storm the marketplace with newly liberated individual energy. Of course, the boom’s costs should not be discounted. Environmental damage has been staggering, the gap between rich and poor has been growing, and urbanization – with all its attendant problems – has surged. And, at least so far, the boom has not induced the systemic political changes for which many hoped. But still, a key question remains unanswered: why did China’s boom happen? This is one of the great questions of our time, relevant not only to China’s future, but to scores of other developing countries enthralled by China’s extraordinary, but still largely unexplained, success.",
            "中国为什么会经历繁荣？ 普罗维登斯，罗得岛 — — 中国正在庆祝被官方称之为“改革开放”的30周年纪念日。 以这种方式来标注时间映射出中国的帝国历史。 在政治转型期 — — 比如一场军事胜利 — — 皇帝也许会指定一个特殊的“年号”来帮助庆祝这个好消息。 一次政治崩溃后，朝廷也可能会尝试使用新的年号，以便把过去所犯下的错误一笔勾销。 唐朝最后一位皇帝在14年中公布了7个年号，徒劳无益地试图重新评价自己的统治，避免政权走向衰亡。 1978年，邓小平开始了“改革开放 ” 。 “改革”是指本着实事求是、按部就班的原则，放松中央对经济生活的管制，以矫正毛泽东的“革命”理念。 与此相似 ， “ 开放”则预示着中华人民共和国与国际社会 — — 特别是西方资本主义社会融为一体。 邓的原则直到今天还在发挥着政策指导作用。 必须回顾满清王朝（1644-1912）及其在18世纪长达60年的“天朝繁荣 ” （ 乾隆）才能找到与之相媲美的连贯的政治和经济政策。 “改革开放”年代在“始作俑者”逝世后的10多年仍然生机勃勃，而且在从邓到江泽民再到胡锦涛的政治权力更替中成为一根贯穿始终的主线。 即便是中国共产党有史以来面对的最大的民意挑战 — — 1989年游行，现在看起来也更像是帮助邓巩固对其发展模式支持的一个标记。 如果有一种因素巩固了中国“改革开放”的决心，那就是过去30年来所发生的异乎寻常的宏观经济变化。 中国人把它叫做发展，也就是“development ” ， 但世界其他国家更普遍地称之为“中国繁荣 ” ， 也有人称之为“中国奇迹 ” 。 繁荣于20世纪70年代末到80年代始于乡下，随之而来的就是今天以工业为主导的城市发展。 事实上，在消费、国外直接投资、国内股票市场、贸易、旅游、海外留学、军事现代化和国际外交等领域，同样经历了许多小规模的“繁荣 ” 。 污染和有毒废物排放也大为增长，同样大涨的还有人们对宗教的兴趣 — — 从佛教到基督教 — — 还有孔子的儒家哲学。 今天的中国很少谈及“克制”二字。 一位影响颇大的时尚业主管声称：驱动经济繁荣的关键因素是妇女涌入劳动大军，特别是南方的制造业领域。 另外一个有说服力的解释来自一位冒险资本家，他认为中国社会充满了创业能量的丰富储备，而在他看来，这些能量储备都源自于中国文化对创业失败几乎不加任何羞辱的事实。 对失败的高度包容使得所有人都为成功而拼命努力。 无论原因如何，繁荣都似乎是一个世纪战争、动乱和革命之后难以达到的顶点，因此只会加重现代中国留给人们的缺乏连贯性的印象。 勿庸置疑，几乎没有研究1978年文革余烬、以及1989年后表面上看去是一片废墟的观察人士认为中国将擎起世界发展希望的火炬。 自相矛盾的是 ， “ 改革开放时代”看上去充满矛盾且缺乏持续性的特色实际上却有助于解释中国的繁荣从何而来。 动荡的毛泽东时代使得许多人对稳定有着深刻的渴望，对自由有着异乎寻常的向往。 邓利用了人们这种厌恶革命的情绪，限制了政治和国家在人们私生活中所发挥的作用，释放了人们压抑已久的能量，鼓励他们追求自己的目标。 革命共产主义很可能也以其他的方式为繁荣铺平了道路，表明从社会乌托邦主义到资本实用主义的转变与其说是反向逆转还不如说是“扼杀创造力”的后续进程。 归根结底，毛针对“封建社会”的文化大革命的确将传统文化夷为平地，不仅毁灭了传统的价值观和制度，也抹去了失败的社会努力，为资本主义发展的种子播撒进中国这片沃土做好了准备。 毛的革命催生了无数修正运动，逆转了从前从未受到过侵犯的统治者对被统治者、学者对工人、丈夫对妻子、父亲对儿子和家庭对个人的主导地位。 到20世纪八九十年代改革之时，将个人捆绑在文化、国家、单位和户口登记制度上的束缚在很大程度上已经不复存在。 摆在大量新增个人企业主和劳工面前的障碍已经扫清，摆脱了家庭和政党责任的束缚，中国民众以刚刚解放出来的个人力量横扫市场。 当然，繁荣所付出的代价也不能忽略不计。 对环境的损害一直如影随形，富人和穷人之间的差距也越拉越大，而与城市化相伴而生的问题 — — 也变得日益严重。 而且，至少到目前为止，繁荣还未能带来许多人所期盼的系统性政治变革。 即便如此，一个关键性的问题仍然需要解答：那就是为什么会出现中国的繁荣？ 这是我们这个时代的一个伟大的疑问，它不仅关系到中国的未来，而且也关系到为中国异乎寻常、但仍然在很大程度上难以解释的成功所着迷的几十个发展中国家的未来。"

            "Why Is China's Growth Rate Falling So Fast? NEW YORK – In early 2021, the consensus forecast for Chinese GDP growth this year among 25 major global banks and other professional forecasters was 8.3%. In contrast, the Chinese government’s own growth target was around 6%, lower than the best guesses of 24 out of the 25 institutional forecasters. Did the government know something that outsiders had missed? Did it plan to do something that it regards as desirable even though it might compromise growth? More recently, international banks have revised down their full-year growth projections for China as the economy’s expansion has slowed. Third-quarter growth was only 4.9% year on year, down from 18.3% and 7.9% in the first two quarters, respectively. The high first-quarter year-on-year growth came in large part because of the negative growth in the first quarter of 2020 due to pandemic-induced lockdowns. The low third-quarter growth is raising concerns about the growth prospects in the fourth quarter and next year. Some of the reduction in growth stems from China’s zero-tolerance policy toward COVID-19, which calls for more frequent lockdowns than in most other countries. A spate of local COVID outbreaks in the summer has triggered lockdowns or travel restrictions in multiple Chinese cities. These have not only reduced manufacturing output but also severely affected many service-sector jobs just as tourism was beginning to boom. But the pandemic is not the only factor behind the slowdown. The government’s green industrial policy, tighter regulation of the property sector, and blacklists of online platforms also have collectively curtailed growth. Following its pledge to halt the rise in China’s carbon-dioxide emissions before 2030 and achieve net zero by 2060, the government has forcefully and often abruptly reduced electricity generation in coal-fired power plants, sometimes by 20%. The resulting power outages disrupted production at affected factories. In addition, the “three red lines” policy, initiated in August 2020 and intensified this year, sets ceilings on property developers’ debt-to-asset ratio, debt-to-equity ratio, and debt-to-cash ratio. Because many of these firms could not meet one or more of the red lines, and banks and capital markets are reluctant to provide new financing, they must sell assets, scale down operations, or both. Evergrande may be the most prominent Chinese property developer to have run into financial trouble, but it is not the only one. Moreover, a real-estate downturn can easily spill over to industries such as steel, cement, and home furnishings and appliances. Lastly, the authorities’ decisions to blacklist online-education companies, ratchet up antitrust enforcement, and enact a broadly worded data-protection law have helped to halve the stock prices of many listed digital-economy companies over the last 12 months. And falling equity valuations are merely the tip of the iceberg, as many digital firms and their suppliers have had to scale back their ambitions and plans. Hundreds of online-education providers have folded and laid off their employees. The goals of the policies are sensible, but the manner of implementing them is exacerbating their economic costs. A zero-COVID strategy was arguably reasonable in the pre-vaccine stage of the pandemic, and helped China to achieve a positive economic growth rate last year. But as new variants continue to emerge, all countries will eventually have to learn to live with the coronavirus. Luckily, the cost of doing so is becoming more manageable as rates of vaccination and natural immunity rise. If China is to use its strong implementation capacity, then pushing for universal COVID-19 vaccination would seem well justified (as individuals who decline the jab may end up harming others). On the other hand, periodic lockdowns and border closures are highly disruptive to the economy and people’s lives, and not a sustainable strategy in the pandemic’s post-vaccine phase. Regarding green industrial policy, power generation is the most carbon-intensive sector in China, accounting for about 40% of the country’s energy-consumption-based emissions. So, reducing reliance on coal-fired electricity makes a valuable contribution to national and global emissions-reduction efforts. But there are different ways to manage the change. China’s own experience with economic reforms suggests that using price signals and market forces tends to minimize the costs of structural change. In particular, raising China’s carbon price to a sufficiently high level and announcing a predictable price path with a sufficient lead time could enable electricity producers and users to adjust and adapt better, thus helping them to achieve the same amount of emissions reductions with much less foregone GDP growth. Such an approach would also be less disruptive for Chinese households, including many in the northeastern part of the country who may be worried about heating and power supply as a cold winter arrives. Likewise, while moderating speculative price increases in real estate is a desirable goal, constraining property development does not necessarily help to achieve it. Given that roughly 30% of the Chinese economy rises or falls with the real estate and construction sectors, an alternative path could cushion the adjustment pains. For example, promoting more affordable housing for low-income families and migrants from rural areas could create offsetting demand for furniture, appliances, steel, and cement. Restricting after-school learning programs can free up time for children to engage in activities that nurture creativity and athletic ability, and alleviate the financial burden for families that previously felt pressured to purchase online-education content for their children. So, there is a laudable social rationale for the new regulation. Its relatively sudden implementation, however, not only reduces online-education firms’ profits, stock prices, and employment, but also highlights the risk of abrupt policy changes in other sectors, affecting broader investor sentiment. China can restore investor confidence and return to its potential growth rate. To do that, the country will benefit from reforms affecting how new regulations and pandemic-control measures are debated, vetted, and implemented.",
            "为什么中国的经济增长率下降得这么快？ 纽约—2021年初，25家全球主要银行和其他专业预测机构一致认为，今年中国GDP增长率将达到8.3 % 。 相比之下，中国政府自己设定的增长目标是6%左右，低于25家预测机构中24家给出的增长率预测值。 中国政府是否关注了一些外界所忽略的信息？ 就算可能会影响到经济增长，政府是否也要做一些他认为更值得的事情？ 最近，由于中国经济增长放缓，国际银行下调了对中国的全年经济增长预测。 第三季度的同比增长仅为4.9 % , 低于第一季度和第二季度的18.3%和7.9 % 。 第一季度呈现高同比增长主要是因为2020年第一季度疫情引起的封锁出现了负增长。 第三季度的低增长率让人们对第四季度和明年的经济增长前景感到担忧。 部分增长的减少源于中国对新冠病毒的零容忍政策,该政策要求比大多数其他国家更频繁地进行封锁。 今年夏天，一连串的地方性新冠疫情引发了中国多个城市的封锁或限制旅行。 这不仅减少了制造业的产出，而且在旅游业兴旺起来的时候，严重影响了许多服务业的工作岗位。 但疫情并不是经济放缓的唯一原因。 政府落实绿色产业政策，严格监管房地产行业，将一些在线平台列入黑名单，共同遏制了经济增长。 政府承诺，中国碳排放量将在2030年达到峰值，中国将在2060年之前实现净零排放。 自此以后，政府经常突然减少燃煤电厂的发电量，有时甚至减少20 % 。 由此造成的停电影响了相关工厂的生产。 此外，2020年8月开始实行并在今年得到强化的“三条红线”政策，对房地产开发商的资产负债率、债权比率和现金负债率设定了上限。 由于这些公司很多都无法达到一条或多条红线的要求，而银行和资本市场又不愿意提供新的融资，因此它们必须出售资产，缩小经营规模，或两者同时进行。 恒大可能是最明显的陷入财务困境的中国房地产开发商，但它并非唯一。 此外，房地产市场低迷很容易波及到钢铁、水泥、家居用品和家电等行业。 最后，政府部门决定将在线教育公司列入黑名单，加大反垄断执法力度，并颁布了一项措辞宽泛的数据保护法，这让许多数字经济上市公司的股价在过去一年中下降了一半。 股价下跌仅仅是冰山一角，许多数字企业及其供应商不得不缩减计划规模。 数以百计的在线教育机构纷纷倒闭并解雇了员工。 这些政策的目标是合理的，但实施的方式却加剧了其经济成本。 在疫苗出来前的疫情阶段，新冠清零战略可以说是合理的，并帮助中国在去年实现了经济正增长。 但是随着病毒变种的不断出现，所有国家最终将不得不学会与新冠病毒共存。 幸运的是，随着疫苗接种率提升，自然免疫力增强，这样做的成本变得更加可控。 如果中国要利用其强大的执行能力，那么推动新冠疫苗普遍接种的计划似乎是合理的（因为拒绝接种的个人可能最终会伤害到其他人 ） 。 另一方面，定期封锁和关闭边境对经济和人民的生活有很大的破坏性，而且在疫苗已研发出来后的疫情下也不是一个可持续的策略。 在绿色产业政策方面，发电行业是中国碳密集度最高的行业，碳排放量占中国能源消费型排放的40%左右。 因此,减少对燃煤发电的依赖，对中国和全球减排工作会做出宝贵的贡献。 但是也有不同的方法来应对这种变化。 中国自身的经济改革经验表明，利用价格信号和市场力量往往能最大限度地降低结构性改革的成本。 例如，将中国的碳价格提升到一个足够高的水平，并在足够长的准备时间内宣布一个可预测的价格路径，可以让电力公司和用户更好地调整和适应，从而帮助他们实现相同数量的减排，这种方法对GDP增长的影响要小得多，对中国家庭的干扰也较小，包括在中国东北地区的许多家庭，他们可能担心寒冬取暖和电力供应问题。 同样，虽然抑制房地产的投机性价格上涨是一个理想的目标，但限制房地产开发并不一定有助于实现这一目标。 鉴于中国经济中约有30%是随着房地产和建筑业的发展而上升或下降的，因此另辟蹊径或许可以缓冲调整带来的阵痛。 例如，为低收入家庭和农村地区的移民提供更多负担得起的住房，可以引发对家具、电器、钢铁和水泥的补偿性需求。 限制课外辅导可以让孩子们腾出时间参与培养创造力和运动能力的活动，并减轻家庭为孩子购买在线教育的经济负担。 这是新规定给社会带来的积极影响。 然而，该规定突然颁布，不仅削减了在线教育公司的利润、股票价格，打击了就业，还突显了其他行业突然遭遇政策变化的风险，影响了广大投资者的情绪。 中国可以恢复投资者的信心，提高经济的潜在增长率。 要做到这一点，中国要进行改革，调整讨论、审查和实施新规定及疫情防控措施的方式。"

            "Why is China Lashing Out? NEW YORK – It must be galling for the Chinese government to keep seeing Nobel Prizes go to the wrong Chinese. The first wrong Chinese was Gao Xingjian, a critical playwright, artist, and novelist, who received the Nobel Prize for literature in 2000, while living in exile in Paris. The latest is Liu Xiaobo, a literary critic and political writer, who was awarded this year’s Nobel Prize for Peace while serving a prison sentence for “subversion” of the Communist regime. Since the Dalai Lama is not a Chinese citizen, I will leave out his Nobel Peace Prize, though to China’s rulers it was perhaps the most irritating of all. Yet the Chinese government’s response to Liu’s Nobel Prize has been extraordinary. Instead of a show of lofty disdain, or official silence, it made a colossal fuss, protesting fiercely about plots to undermine China, and putting dozens of prominent Chinese intellectuals, including Liu’s wife, Liu Xia, under house arrest. As a result, the utterly powerless, hitherto quite obscure Liu Xiaobo, has become not only world famous, but much better known inside China, too. Combine this with China’s bullying of Japan, by blocking the export of rare-earth metals vital for Japanese industry, over a few uninhabited islands between Taiwan and Okinawa, and its refusal to let the renminbi appreciate, and one must wonder why China is being so heavy-handed in its foreign relations. These strong-arm tactics stand out even more against the deftness of Chinese diplomacy over the last few decades. Japan, the old wartime enemy, has been outmaneuvered repeatedly, and a soft touch made South Koreans and Southeast Asians feel relatively comfortable with China’s increasing power. But China’s recent thuggish behavior is changing Asian opinions. As the warm welcome given to Hillary Clinton on her recent swing through Asia – even in communist Vietnam – appears to show, Southeast Asians are more than happy to hang on to Pax Americana for a bit longer, out of fear of China. Other Asian countries might even be drawn closer to Japan, the only alternative to the US as a counterbalance to the Middle Kingdom. This cannot be what China wants. So why is China being so severe? One possible explanation is that China is a little drunk on its new great-power status. For the first time in almost 200 years, China can really throw its weight around, and it will do what it wants, regardless of what other countries may think. A few decades ago, it was Japan that thought it was going to be Number One, and its businessmen, politicians, and bureaucrats were not shy about letting the rest of the world know. Call China’s recent actions revenge for a century of humiliation by stronger powers. But this may not be the best explanation for China’s behavior. In fact, the reason may be just the opposite: a sense among China’s rulers of weakness at home. At least since 1989, the legitimacy of the Chinese Communist Party’s monopoly on power has been fragile. Communist ideology is a spent force. Using the People’s Liberation Army to murder civilian protesters, not only in Beijing, but all over China in June 1989, further undermined the one-party system’s legitimacy. The way to regain the support of the burgeoning Chinese middle class was to promise a quick leap to greater prosperity through high-speed economic growth. The ideological vacuum left by the death of Marxist orthodoxy was filled with nationalism. And nationalism in China, promoted through schools, mass media, and “patriotic” monuments and museums, means one thing: only the firm rule of the CCP will prevent foreigners, especially Westerners and the Japanese, from humiliating Chinese ever again. This is why anyone, even a relatively unknown intellectual like Liu Xiaobo, who challenges the legitimacy of Communist Party rule by demanding multi-party elections, must be crushed. It is why the government does not dare to let the renminbi appreciate too fast, lest economic growth slow, causing the Party loses face and legitimacy. And it is why bullying Japan is always a good option: China’s rulers do not necessarily hate Japan, but they are afraid to look weak in the eyes of their citizens, who are taught from kindergarten that foreign powers want to humiliate China. This suggests that if Liu Xiaobo and like-minded dissidents ever got their wish, and democracy came to China, the problem of Chinese nationalism would not go away. After all, if the people feel persecuted by Japan or the United States, then the people will demand chauvinistic policies. Democracy has not tempered South Korean chauvinism much, either, since the demise of the military dictatorship in the 1980’s. But nationalism may not be a political constant. Nationalism is often fed by a sense of impotence. When citizens feel disempowered by an authoritarian government, the next best thing is to feel empowered by national prowess. In a multi-party democracy, on the other hand, citizens are concerned with other interests, material, social, even cultural ones, and thus less likely to be drawn into aggressive chauvinism. Or so we must hope. The state of many democracies today is not the best advertisement for political freedom. But the Chinese should have the right to decide about that themselves. And Liu Xiaobo should be honored for saying so.",
            "中国为何发飙？ 发自纽约 - - -眼看着诺贝尔奖一次次落入错误的中国人之手，中国政府一定感到怒不可遏吧。 翻开诺贝尔奖的历史，第一位获奖的错误中国人是著名剧作家，艺术家和小说家高行健，他在2000年获得了诺贝尔文学奖，当时他正在巴黎过着流亡的日子。 最近的一位则是政治评论家和作家刘晓波，他是今年的和平奖得主，因被判“颠覆”国家政权罪而身陷牢狱。 鉴于达赖喇嘛不是中国公民，尽管他的得奖是最让中国政府不可容忍的，但我还是没有把他计算在内。 不过，对刘晓波的获奖，中国政府这回的反应还是有点不同寻常。 有别于以往蔑视或保持官方沉默的态度，它这回显得极度震惊，强烈抗议这一破坏中国的阴谋，并悍然软禁了数十名国内著名知识分子，其中包括刘晓波的妻子刘霞。 结果名不经传又没什么影响力的刘晓波不仅蜚声国际，也为中国国内所家喻户晓了。 把这件事与在台湾和冲绳之间几个无人小岛的主权问题上以禁止作为日本工业命脉的稀土出口来要挟日本，以及拒绝人民币升值等事件放在一起来看，人们一定会疑惑中国为什么突然采取如此笨拙的外交手段。 这种铁腕策略明显地违背了中国在过去几十年里一直坚守的灵活外交。 正是凭借这种灵活的外交手法，中国才使得日本这个战争年代的对手一直处于外交下风，也让韩国和东南亚各国接受了其崛起。 但是，中国现在这种来势汹汹的态度正引起亚洲的警觉。 正如希拉里新近在亚洲（甚至在越南）巡回访问所受到的热烈欢迎所显示，出于对中国崛起的恐惧，东南亚乐于在美国治下的和平待久一点。 其他亚洲国家则只能别无选择地更亲近日本，因为它是除美国之外唯一能与中土王朝抗衡的国家。 这些当然都不是中国所愿看到的。 至此，我们不禁要问，为什么中国要如此强势？ 一种解释是中国面对其新获得的大国地位有点昏了头。 在差不多200多年的时间里，中国第一次尝到能够真正地展现它影响力的甜头，它将无视他国的看法而为所欲为。 几十年前，那时的日本也认为自己是世界第一，它的商人，政治家和官员也禁不住向世界各国耀武扬威。 同理，我们也可以把中国最近的蛮横看作是用强权对百年屈辱的报复。 不过，我觉得这不是对中国最近行为最好的解释。 事实上，真正的原因可能正好是这个解释的反面：中国统治者感到在国内统治的衰弱。 至少从1989年开始，中国共产党独裁的合法性就已经变得很脆弱了。 共产主义意识形态已是明日黄花。 1989年6月，人民解放军在北京及去全国各地残杀异见人士的恶劣行径进一步削弱了一党专制的基础。 为了挽回新兴中产阶级的支持，共产党许诺将通过高速经济发展向集体富裕大步迈进。 由于对马克思主义信仰的幻灭而带来的意识形态真空被民族主义所填补。 而中国通过学校，大众媒体以及“爱国”纪念碑和博物馆所宣扬的民族主义，其核心只有一条：只有在中国共产的领导下，才能避免外国，特别是西方和日本，羞辱中国的历史重演。 这就是为什么任何挑战共产党统治的合法性，提倡多党制的人，即便如刘晓波这样鲜为人知的学者，都必须被打倒。 这也是为什么中国政府不敢让人民币升值太快的原因，避免经济衰退，导致共产党没面子和丧失统治地位。 这也是为什么欺负日本总是外交手段的一个好选择：中国的统治者不一定恨日本，但他们不能接受被国人视为软弱无能，因为国人从小就被教导国外势力都企图欺负中国。 这就意味着，即便刘晓波和类似的异见人士得偿所愿，民主真的降临中国，但中国民族主义的问题仍将如影随形地存在。 毕竟，如果人们感到遭受了日本或美国的迫害，那么他们就会强烈要求国家采取大国沙文主义政策。 20世纪80年代，虽然韩国推翻了国内的军事独裁，但民主并没有缓和其沙文主义政策。 不过，民族主义不是一个政治常态。 民族主义通常都由软弱无力的感受所激发。 当公民感到被权威政府剥夺了权利时，为避免民族主义抬头，接下来最好还是让他们为国家强大的实力而自豪。 另一方面，在一个多党制民主国家里，民众可以选择关注其他别的利益，物质的，社会的，甚或是文化的，因此很少会投入侵略性的沙文主义怀抱之中。 或者说，我们希望是这样的。 尽管当今世界许多民主国家的情况并不能最好地体现政治自由的好处，但中国人应该有选择的权利。 从这个角度讲，刘晓波获得诺奖，当之无愧。"

            "Why is France Burning? The urban disturbances in France have been called the most severe since the riots by students and workers in 1968. The analogy is misleading. While the 1968 protests challenged the French Republican model to live up to its finest aspirations, today’s crisis challenges the French Revolution’s model of citizenship and integration itself. The French Republican model asserts that all French citizens have the same cultural identity. Indeed, this is the only acceptable identity. To achieve this shared identity, all citizens have to speak the one official language and be educated according to a common curriculum. But they also enjoy equal rights, and have the same duties, in the public arena. All this is not only fostered by the state, but also requires the kind of uniformity that only a centralized state can impose. Indeed, the French Revolution’s ideological commitment to unity was so strong that during parts of the nineteenth century, advocating federalism was a capital offense. Three components of this model incited today’s crisis and make it difficult for the French Republic to address it effectively. The first component is the classic French Republican prohibition on gathering data in the official census – or by government agencies or public or private enterprises – on ethnicity, religion, and even social class. Collecting these data would, it is argued, violate the Republican tenet that France is “one and indivisible.” But the absence of a secondary breakdown of such data, like the UK-style, four-fold class analysis (plus examination of patterns of unemployment by ethnicity or religion), makes it hard for social workers, public heath officials, and economic planners to diagnose new problems. Without the necessary data for analysis, public health policies, for example, cannot be directed toward groups that are especially disadvantaged or otherwise at risk. The second factor is the classic French Republican rejection of, and legal norms against, any form of “affirmative action,” or positive discrimination, even of the most inoffensive kind. Like the prohibition of fine-tuned data – without which positive discrimination is in any case impossible – affirmative action is seen as damaging to the Republican model because it is based on recognition of ethnic differences. The third component is the post-welfare state, which is now part of the French model of citizenship and guarantees all full-time employees one of the highest minimum wages in the world and high employer-paid benefits. This makes it extremely difficult to let workers go, which makes employers reluctant to hire new people in the first place. Many of the social-democratic countries of Europe, like Sweden, Holland, and Denmark, created similar norms in their full-employment eras. Unlike France, however, they also used census data to identify pockets of new unemployment, and to invest socially and politically, not only in excellent job-training programs, but in job creation, and, just as importantly, in job-placement schemes. France is now very bad at creating new jobs. It has few training programs, but high benefits for the unemployed and strong restrictions against firing workers. Put all of this together, and it is like slamming a door in the face of young minority men looking for work. This is the primary cause of the 30-50% unemployment rates among minorities aged 16-24 in many French “urban zones of sensitivity.” Thus, the riots that France is now seeing emerge from French policies, not from instigations by Islamists. France has simply failed to incorporate minority citizens – many of them third-generation immigrants who have been educated for twenty years in assimilationist public schools. But few political leaders accept that the crisis has anything to do with the French model of citizenship. Indeed, they confidently wait for assimilation to kick in. But in today’s high unemployment, low job-creation, and now multicultural France, assimilation will not occur without big changes. France is only now beginning to come to grips with the crisis of its Republican model of equal citizenship. A newly created Minister of Social Cohesion has begun to commission studies documenting discrimination. One study showed that for similarly qualified job applicants, those with an Islamic-sounding name, and an address in an ethnically segmented suburb, had only one-fifth the chance of even getting an interview as people with a French-sounding name and a “safe” address. Two hundred and fifty of the largest private and public enterprises have created an organization aimed at working with the government to allow them, for the first time ever, to document, and then redress, their discriminatory employment practices. Fortunately, organized Muslim leaders so far have not aggravated the rioting. Of course, the government’s reduction of community policing in favor of paramilitary forces stationed in quasi-military barracks, and the Minister of Interior’s description of the young rioters as “scum” who should be washed away with an industrial power hose, has not helped. The French Republican model enshrines the laudable abstract principles of liberty, equality, and fraternity. However, so long as second- and third-generation minority citizens are taught that the only acceptable cultural identity is French, but are not in fact accepted as French – indeed, are blocked from enjoying the full rights of French citizenship – the Republican model will fuel alienation rather than democratic integration.",
            "法国为何在燃烧？ 法国的城市骚乱被称为1968年学潮和工潮以来最为严重的事件。 这个比喻是不恰当的。 1968年的抗议要求法兰西共和国实现其最高的理想，而今天的危机则挑战法国大革命的公民资格和融入模式本身。 法兰西共和国模式宣扬所有的法国公民都有相同的文化特征。 实际上，这是唯一可以接受的特征。 为了实现这一共同特征，所有的公民都必须讲唯一的官方语言并按照相同的课程接受教育。 但是在公共场合，他们也享有平等的权利和同样的义务。 这一切不仅由国家予以扶持，而且要求一种只有中央集权国家才能施行的统一。 实际上，法国大革命对于团结的意识形态上的承诺十分严肃，以致于在十九世纪的某些时候，鼓吹联邦主义是死罪。 这一模式的三个要素引发了今天的危机，并且使得法兰西共和国难以有效地加以解决。 第一个要素是，法兰西共和国素来禁止在官方人口普查中，或者由政府机构或私营企业收集有关种族、宗教甚至是社会阶层的数据。 法国认为，收集这些数据会违反共和国的信条，也就是，法兰西是“统一不可分割的 ” 。 但是，如果没有像英国模式那样对此类数据进行第二层分析以及四层社会阶层分析（加上按照种族或宗教区分进行的失业模式分析 ） ， 使得社会工作者、政府卫生官员以及经济规划者很难诊断新的问题。 举例说，没有进行分析所必要的数据，就难以针对特别弱势或有危险的群体制定公共卫生政策。 第二个因素是，法兰西共和国一向拒绝任何形式的、哪怕是最无伤害的“肯定行动”或积极性区别对待，并且在法律上予以禁止。 没有对数据的精确分析就不可能有积极性区别对待。 肯定行动和精确分析一样基于承认种族区别而被视为有害于共和国模式。 第三个因素是后福利国家。 这是法国公民资格模式的一部分，并且保证给所有全职雇员全世界最高的最低工资和很高的雇主支付的福利。 这样就很难解雇工人，而且使得雇主不愿意招募新的雇员。 瑞典、荷兰和丹麦等众多欧洲社会民主主义国家在它们全面就业时期建立了类似的规定。 但是，和法国不同的是，它们也使用人口普查数据来确定新的失业人口的经济状况，在社会福利和政治上不仅建立良好的职业培训项目，而且也创造就业机会，同时更为重要的是，建立职业介绍规划。 法国目前在创造就业机会上无所作为。 基本上没有培训项目，而失业福利很高，解雇限制重重。 凡此种种，就如同在找工作的少数族裔年轻人面前关上大门一样。 法国的许多“敏感城市地带”中16岁至24岁少数族裔人口失业率达到30％到50 ％ ， 这是首要原因。 因此，法国现在看到的骚乱源于法国的政策，而不是穆斯林煽动。 法国根本上没有融合少数族裔公民，他们中的许多人都是第三代移民，在同化主义的公共学校中接受了二十年的教育。 但是，很少有政治领导人承认这场危机和法国的公民资格模式有关。 实际上，他们都充满信心，等待同化奏效。 但是，在当今高失业率、低就业机会以及多元文化的法国，没有巨大的变革就不会有同化。 法国目前刚刚开始应付共和国平等公民资格模式的危机。 新近成立的社会凝聚部已经开始委托进行有关歧视的研究。 其中一项研究发现，对于大体同样合格的求职者，那些听起来像伊斯兰的名字和种族分离郊区的地址的人得到哪怕是面试的机会只有那些听起来像法国人的名字和“安全的”地址的人的五分之一。 二百五十家最大的私营和公营企业建立了一个组织，旨在和政府合作让它们第一次记述歧视性的雇用做法并加以矫正。 所幸的是，有组织的穆斯林领导人目前为止并没有加重骚乱。 当然，政府减少社区警力而将半军事化部队驻扎在半军事化营房内、内政部长将年轻的骚乱份子称为应当用强力工业水笼冲刷掉的“人渣”则于事无补。 法兰西共和国崇仰值得称赞的、���象的自由、平等和博爱的原则。 但是，只要第二和第三代少数裔公民被教化说唯一可以接受的文化特征是法国式的，而实际上并不被接纳为法国人，却无法享受作为法国公民所理应享受的完整的权利，那么，这一共和国模式将会激起分离，而非民主化融合。"

            "Why ISIS Persists NEW YORK – Deadly terrorist attacks in Istanbul, Dhaka, and Baghdad demonstrate the murderous reach of the Islamic State (ISIS) in Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. The longer ISIS maintains its strongholds in Syria and Iraq, the longer its terrorist network will create such carnage. Yet ISIS is not especially difficult to defeat. The problem is that none of the states involved in Iraq and Syria, including the United States and its allies, has so far treated ISIS as its primary foe. It’s time they do. ISIS has a small fighting force, which the US puts at 20,000 to 25,000 in Iraq and Syria, and another 5,000 or so in Libya. Compared to the number of active military personnel in Syria (125,000), Iraq (271,500), Saudi Arabia (233,500), Turkey (510,600), or Iran (523,000), ISIS is minuscule. Despite US President Barack Obama’s pledge in September 2014 to “degrade and ultimately destroy” ISIS, the US and its allies, including Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Israel (behind the scenes), have been focusing instead on toppling Syria’s Bashar al-Assad. Consider a recent candid statement by Israeli Major General Herzi Halevy (quoted to me by a journalist who attended the speech where Halevy made it): “Israel does not want to see the situation in Syria end with [ISIS] defeated, the superpowers gone from the region, and [Israel] left with a Hezbollah and Iran that have greater capabilities.” Israel opposes ISIS, but Israel’s greater concern is Assad’s Iranian backing. Assad enables Iran to support two paramilitary foes of Israel, Hezbollah and Hamas. Israel therefore prioritizes the removal of Assad over the defeat of ISIS. For the US, steered by neoconservatives, the war in Syria is a continuation of the plan for global US hegemony launched by Defense Secretary Richard Cheney and Under Secretary Paul Wolfowitz at the Cold War’s end. In 1991, Wolfowitz told US General Wesley Clark: “But one thing we did learn [from the Persian Gulf War] is that we can use our military in the region – in the Middle East – and the Soviets won’t stop us. And we’ve got about 5 or 10 years to clean up those old Soviet regimes – Syria, Iran (sic), Iraq – before the next great superpower comes on to challenge us.” The multiple US wars in the Middle East – Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Libya, and others – have sought to remove the Soviet Union, and then Russia, from the scene and to give the US hegemonic sway. These efforts have failed miserably. For Saudi Arabia, as for Israel, the main goal is to oust Assad in order to weaken Iran. Syria is part of the extensive proxy war between Shia Iran and Sunni Saudi Arabia that plays out in the battlefields of Syria and Yemen and in bitter Shia-Sunni confrontations in Bahrain and other divided countries in the region (including Saudi Arabia itself). For Turkey, the overthrow of Assad would bolster its regional standing. Yet Turkey now faces three foes on its southern border: Assad, ISIS, and nationalist Kurds. ISIS has so far taken a back seat to Turkey’s concerns about Assad and the Kurds. But ISIS-directed terrorist attacks in Turkey may be changing that. Russia and Iran, too, have pursued their own regional interests, including through proxy wars and support for paramilitary operations. Yet both have signaled their readiness to cooperate with the US to defeat ISIS, and perhaps to solve other problems as well. The US has so far spurned these offers, because of its focus on toppling Assad. The US foreign-policy establishment blames Russian President Vladimir Putin for defending Assad, while Russia blames the US for trying to overthrow him. These complaints might seem symmetrical, but they’re not. The attempt by the US and its allies to overthrow Assad violates the UN Charter, while Russia’s support of Assad is consistent with Syria’s right of self-defense under that charter. Yes, Assad is a despot, but the UN Charter does not give license to any country to choose which despots to depose. The persistence of ISIS underscores three strategic flaws in US foreign policy, along with a fatal tactical flaw. First, the neocon quest for US hegemony through regime change is not only bloody-minded arrogance; it is classic imperial overreach. It has failed everywhere the US has tried it. Syria and Libya are the latest examples. Second, the CIA has long armed and trained Sunni jihadists through covert operations funded by Saudi Arabia. In turn, these jihadists gave birth to ISIS, which is a direct, if unanticipated, consequence of the policies pursued by the CIA and its Saudi partners. Third, the US perception of Iran and Russia as implacable foes of America is in many ways outdated and a self-fulfilling prophecy. A rapprochement with both countries is possible. Fourth, on the tactical side, the US attempt to fight a two-front war against both Assad and ISIS has failed. Whenever Assad has been weakened, Sunni jihadists, including ISIS and al-Nusra Front, have filled the vacuum. Assad and his Iraqi counterparts can defeat ISIS if the US, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and Iran provide air cover and logistical support. Yes, Assad would remain in power; yes, Russia would retain an ally in Syria; and yes, Iran would have influence there. Terrorist attacks would no doubt continue, perhaps even in the name of ISIS for a while; but the group would be denied its base of operations in Syria and Iraq. Such an outcome would not only end ISIS on the ground in the Middle East; it could lay the groundwork for reducing regional tensions more generally. The US and Russia could begin to reverse their recent new cold war through shared efforts to stamp out jihadist terrorism. (A pledge that NATO will not offer admission to Ukraine or escalate missile defenses in Eastern Europe would also help.) There’s more. A cooperative approach to defeating ISIS would give Saudi Arabia and Turkey reason and opportunity to find a new modus vivendi with Iran. Israel’s security could be enhanced by bringing Iran into a cooperative economic and geopolitical relationship with the West, in turn enhancing the chances for a long-overdue two-state settlement with Palestine. The rise of ISIS is a symptom of the shortcomings of current Western – particularly US – strategy. The West can defeat ISIS. The question is whether the US will undertake the strategic reassessment needed to accomplish that end.",
            "为何ISIS能持久存在 纽约—伊斯坦布尔、达卡和巴格达的致命恐怖袭击表明伊斯兰国（ISIS）的魔爪已经触及欧洲、北非、中东和亚洲多部。 ISIS在叙利亚和伊拉克保持强势越久，其恐怖网络炮制此类大屠杀的日子也越久。 但ISIS并不特别难以根除。 问题在于牵涉伊拉克和叙利亚的各国，包括美国及其盟国，都没有将ISIS作为主要敌人。 这一点应该改变了。 ISIS有一支小规模战斗力量，美国预测其在伊拉克和叙利亚有20,000到25,000人，在利比亚还有5,000人左右。 与叙利亚（125,000 ） 、 伊拉克（271,500 ） 、 沙特阿拉伯（233,500 ） 、 土耳其（510,600）和伊朗（523,000）现役军队人数相比，ISIS根本不值一提。 2014年9月，美国总统奥巴马承诺“打击并最终消灭”ISIS，但美国及其盟国，包括沙特阿拉伯、土耳其和以色列（在幕后 ） ， 一直专注于颠覆叙利亚的巴沙尔·阿萨德。 最近，以色列陆军少将赫尔齐·哈勒威（Herzi Halevy）直言不讳地声称（由一位哈勒威讲话现场的记者向我转述 ） ： “以色列不想看到叙利亚局势以（ISIS）被击败、超级大国退出该地区 、 （ 以色列）面对实力更强的真主党和伊朗结束 。 ” 以色列反对ISIS，但以色列更大的担忧是阿萨德背后的伊朗。 阿萨德让伊朗得以支持以色列的两大准军事对手 — — 真主党和哈马斯。 因此，以色列的重点是推翻阿萨德，而不是击败ISIS。 受新保守主义影响，对美国来说，叙利亚战争是国防部长切尼（Richard Cheney）和副国务卿保罗·沃尔福威茨（Paul Wolfowitz）在冷战结束时所提出的全球美国霸权计划的延续。 1991年，沃尔福威茨对美国将军韦斯利·克拉克（Wesley Clark）说： “但我们（从海湾战争中）确实学到了一件事，那就是我们可以在该地区 — — 在中东 — — 使用武力，而苏联人不会阻止我们。 在下一个超级大国出现挑战我们之前，我们有大约5到10年时间清理旧苏联政权 — — 叙利亚、伊朗（原文如此 ） 、 伊拉克 。 ” 美国在中东的多场战争 — — 阿富汗、伊拉克、叙利亚、利比亚，等等 — — 是为了让苏联以及随后的俄罗斯退出竞争，让美国独树霸权。 这些“努力”遭到了惨败。 对沙特阿拉伯，以及对以色列来说，主要目标是颠覆阿萨德以削弱伊朗。 叙利亚是什叶派伊朗和逊尼派沙特阿拉伯之间规模浩大的代理战争的一部分，这场战争在叙利亚和也门等��场展开，也在巴林和其他该地区有分裂倾向的国家（包括沙特阿拉伯本身）更加激烈的什叶派-逊尼派对峙前沿展开。 对土耳其来说，推翻阿萨德将加强它的地区地位。 但土耳其现在在其南部边境面临三个对手：阿萨德、ISIS以及民族主义库尔德人。 到目前为止，ISIS对土耳其来说不如阿萨德和库尔德人重要。 但ISIS炮制的土耳其恐怖袭击可能改变这一局面。 俄罗斯和伊朗也追求自身的地区利益，通过代理战争和支持准军事行动实现。 但两国都表态准备与美国合作打击ISIS，并且可以在解决其他问题方面也进行合作。 到目前为止，美国一直无动于衷，因为它的关注点是颠覆阿萨德。 美国外交政策界谴责俄罗斯总统普京袒护阿萨德，而俄罗斯谴责美国试图推翻阿萨德。 这些抱怨看上去针锋相对，实则不然。 美国及其盟国颠覆阿萨德的尝试违反了联合国宪章，而俄罗斯支持阿萨德符合宪章规定的叙利亚的自卫权。 诚然，阿萨德是一位暴君，但联合国宪章并没有授予任何国家选择推翻哪位暴君的权力。 ISIS的持久存在彰显出美国外交政策的三大战略缺陷，以及一个致命战术缺陷。 首先，新保守主义要求通过颠覆政权实现美国霸权不但是血腥思维的无知；更是经典的帝国主义不自量力。 凡是美国如此尝试的地方，无一不以失败告终。 叙利亚和利比亚是最新的例子。 其次，中央情报局长期以来通过沙特阿拉伯出资的秘密行动武装和培训逊尼派圣战者。 反过来，这些圣战者催生了ISIS，这是中央情报局及其沙特合作者所追求的政策的同一个直接（或许是意料外的）后果。 第三，美国将伊朗和俄罗斯视为美国不可和解的敌人在很大程度上是一个自我实现的过时预言。 与两国重塑关系是可能的。 第四，在战术层面，美国试图打赢对阿萨德和ISIS的双线战争已经失败。 凡是阿萨德被削弱时候，逊尼派圣战者，包括ISIS和努斯拉阵线（al-Nusira Front）就会填补真空。 如果美国、俄罗斯、沙特阿拉伯和伊朗提供空中掩护和物流支持，阿萨德及其伊拉克同道能够击败ISIS。 诚然，阿萨德将继续掌权；诚然，俄罗斯将继续是叙利亚的盟国；诚然，伊朗将在那里获得影响力。 恐怖袭击毫无疑问将继续存在，也许在一段时间里仍将打着ISIS的旗号；但该组织将被驱逐出其在叙利亚和伊拉克的行动基地。 这一结果不但可以在中东大地上根除ISIS；还能为更加全面地缓解地区紧张打下基础。 美国和俄罗斯可以通过共同驱逐圣战恐怖主义开始扭转最近的新冷战。 （北约承诺不让乌克兰入盟或不升级东欧弹道导弹防御也能有所裨益。 ） 还有其他好处。 采取合作方针打击ISIS将给沙特阿拉伯和土耳其理由和机会寻找与伊朗的新权宜之计。 以色列的安全可以通过让伊朗构建与西方的合作性经济和地缘政治关系、反过来增加一拖再拖的以巴两国和解的机会而得到强化。 ISIS的崛起是当前西方 — — 尤其是美国 — — 战略缺陷的表征。 西方能够击败ISIS。 问题在于美国是否会进行实现这一目标所需要的战略重估。"

            "Why Is Physics Beautiful? CAMBRIDGE – The nineteenth-century physicist Heinrich Hertz once described his feeling that James Clerk Maxwell’s equations, which depict the fundamentals of electricity and magnetism, “have an independent existence and an intelligence of their own, that they are wiser…even than their discoverers, that we get more out of them than was originally put into them.” Not long after, Albert Einstein called Niels Bohr’s atomic model “the highest form of musicality in the sphere of thought.” More recently, the late Nobel laureate Richard Feynman, describing his discovery of new laws of physics, declared, “You can recognize truth by its beauty and simplicity.” Similar sentiments are all but universal among modern physicists. Wishful thinking could never produce working iPhones, photographs of Pluto, or atomic bombs. Physics, as summarized in a handful of mathematically precise laws, indisputably works. Yet many things that “work” do not inspire the kind of admiration that the fundamental laws of nature do. Their beauty is rooted, first, in the laws’ symmetry, here meaning the possibility of change without change – a precise yet almost mystical concept. Just as a circle can be rotated about its center at any angle, changing the position of each of its points without changing its form, symmetric laws apply to changed situations without changing or losing validity. For example, special relativity asserts that the fundamental laws of physics remain the same when we view the world from a platform moving at constant velocity. Similarly, so-called time translation symmetry encodes the uniformity of physical law in time: Even as the universe ages, the laws remain the same. The second source of beauty in the laws of physics is their productivity – what I call their exuberance. Just a handful of basic principles generates an astonishing wealth of consequences – everything in the physical world! You can write the equations of the core theories of physics – known as the standard model – quite comfortably on a T-shirt. To paraphrase Hertz, they give back far more than we put in. It is important to note that the laws of physics need not necessarily have such marvelous properties. Consider this hypothetical situation: Developments in computer power, virtual reality, and artificial intelligence enable the creation of self-aware beings whose “world” is, from our perspective, a programmed simulation. If a self-aware Super Mario began to analyze the laws of his world, he would find very little symmetry or productivity. Instead, he would find a vast collection of loosely connected, quirky rules, reflecting the whims of the programmer. The beauty of physical law is too impressive to be accidental. It has led people throughout history to believe that some tasteful higher being created us, and that we inhabit a consciously designed world, like our notional Super Mario. But this is an extravagant hypothesis, which goes far beyond the facts it is meant to explain. Before adopting it, we should explore more economical alternatives. The answer likely lies within us. Beautiful things are those in which we find pleasure and seek out. They are, in neurobiological terms, things that stimulate our reward system. That explains why parents tend to find their young children beautiful, and adults are attracted to nubile models and their images. It makes evolutionary sense to reward such feelings. The evolutionary utility of the beauty of physical laws is somewhat less obvious, but no less real. Given the usefulness of accurately assessing the consequences of our actions, our reward system has evolved so that we derive joy from making successful predictions. Understanding the forces and patterns defining our world, and especially principles that apply (without changing) to a wide variety of situations, can help to improve our predictions. The fact that we can often infer the behavior of complex objects or systems from knowledge of their parts – that we get back more than we put in – can help us to hone our predictions further. In short, because evolution predisposes us to find beautiful those things that help us understand the world correctly, it is no accident that we find the correct laws of nature beautiful. Viewed from this perspective, the apparent beauty of the laws of physics – our attraction to their symmetry and exuberance – is not surprising. What remains mysterious is why they are comprehensible. A profound link between beauty and comprehensibility is an increasingly important source of scientific progress. Today’s frontiers of fundamental physics are far removed from everyday experience. They are difficult and expensive to access experimentally, and we cannot rely on our intuition to fill in the blanks. The patient accumulation of fact recommended by Francis Bacon, Isaac Newton, and Sherlock Holmes is thus no longer practical. Instead, we reverse the process, using guesswork to motivate experiment. We first construct beautiful equations, then derive their consequences, and, finally, craft experiments to test them. In recent decades, that strategy has proved remarkably successful. It has given us quantum chromodynamics, which resolves the central problem of nuclear physics, as well as predicting the Higgs particle and much else. Rather than recognizing the beauty of laws otherwise discovered, we use principles of beauty – vast symmetry and a high ratio of output to input – to enable discovery. When this works, we have an “anthropic” explanation of the laws’ beauty: If they were not beautiful, we would not have found them.",
            "物理学为何是美？ 纽约剑桥—十九世纪物理学家赫兹曾经描述道，他觉得构成电磁学基础的麦克斯韦方程组“拥有独立存在和自己的智能，它们甚至比其他发现者 … … 都跟聪明，我们从它们身上得到的比我们最初投入它们身上的更多 。 ” 此后不久，爱因斯坦将玻尔的原子模型称为“思想界最高的音乐形式 。 ” 更晚近一些，已故诺贝尔物理学奖获得者费曼这样描述他所发现的物理学新定律 ： “ 你可以从它的美和简单中认识真理 。 ” 类似的感觉在现代物理学家中间无处不在。 想当然永远无法创造出能用的iPhone、冥王星照片和原子弹。 被总结为一小撮数学上精确的定律的物理学毫无争议是有效的。 但许多“有效”的东西并没有激起类似于对自然基本定律的崇拜的情感。 物理学定律的美首先植根于它们的对称性（symmetry ） — —这里意味着不变之变的可能性 — — 一个精确的，但几乎是神秘的概念。 正如圆可以绕其圆心旋转任意角度，让圆上所有的点改变位置而不改变圆本身的形状，对称定律适用于变化的情况而不必作出变化或失去有效性。 比如，狭义相对论认为，当我们从匀速运动的平台看世界时，物理学基本定律不会发生改变。 类似地，所谓的时间平移对称性描述了物理学定律在时间上的一致性：就算天荒地老，定律依然不变。 物理学定律之美的第二个来源是其生产力（productivity ） — —我称之为繁茂（exuberance ） 。 少数几个基本原理就能衍生出令人震惊的大量结果 — — 物理学世界的一切！ 你可以轻松地在一件T恤衫上写下物理学核心理论的方程组 — — 所谓的标准模型。 用赫兹的话说，它们给我们的东西比我们投入它们的东西更多。 物理学定律不一定具有如此非凡的性质，认识到这一点很重要。 考虑以下假想情形：计算机能力、虚拟现实和人工智能的发展让我们得以创造出一种有自我意识的物种，它们的“世界”在我们看来是一种编程仿真。 如果有自我意识的超级马里奥开始分析他的世界的定律，他不会发现多少对称性和生产力。 相反，我们会发现大量联系松散的古怪规则，它们反映出编程者的奇思妙想。 物理定律之美实在太炫目，它不可能是偶然的。 这让历史上的人们相信，是一些情趣高雅的高等生物创造了我们，我们定居在一个刻意设计的世界中，就像我们的抽象的超级马里奥。 但这是一个夸张的假说，远远超过了它意在解释的事实。 在接受它以前，我们应该考察一下，更划算的替代方案。 答案可能在我们中间。 美丽的东西是我们可以从中找到并获得愉悦的东西。 用神经生物学的术语讲，它们是刺激我们的犒赏系统的东西。 这解释了为何父母亲总是认为他们的小孩很美，成年人总是被性感模特和他们的照片吸引。 犒赏这些感觉具有进化意义。 物理学之美的进化效用也许不那么明显，但也是实实在在的。 准确评估我们的行为的后果十分有用，因此，我们的犒赏系统进化出一种能力，让我们从做出成功的预测中感到乐趣。 理解决定我们的世界的力量和模式，特别是（无需变化）适用于各种情况的原理，有助于改善我们的预测。 我们常常可以从关于复杂对象或系统的某些部分的知识中推断它们的行为 — — 获得比我们的投入更多的东西 — — 这一事实有助于我们进一步精炼我们的预测。 简言之，由于进化让我们倾向于认为有助于我们正确理解世界的东西是美丽的，因此，我们发现自然定律之美并非偶然。 从这个角度看，物理学定律的显而易见的美 — — 我们被它们的对称性和繁茂所吸引 — — 并不令人奇怪。 依然神秘的是为何它们可以被理解。 美和可理解性之间的意义深远的联系是科学进步日益重要的源泉。 今天的基础物理学前沿早已不是来自日常生活。 要想用实验接近它们困难又昂贵，我们也不可能依靠直觉填补空白。 因此，培根、牛顿和福尔摩斯所建议的耐心地积累事实已不再具有实践意义。 相反，我们倒转了这一过程，用猜测驱动实验。 我们首先构造美妙的方程组，然后导出结果，最后设计实验验证它们。 近几十年来，这一战略取得了令人瞩目的成功。 它给我们带来了量子色动力学，该学科解决了核物理学的核���问题，并预言了希格斯粒子和其他许多成果。 我们不是去认识发现的定律的美，而是用美的原理 — — 高度对称和高投入产出比 — — 来促成发现。 当这起作用时，我们就有了关于美的定律的“人类”解释：如果它们不美，我们就不会发现它们。"

            "Why is the US Presidential Race So Close? WASHINGTON, DC – Many people around the world are probably wondering why Hillary Clinton – who is obviously more prepared and better suited for the American presidency than her opponent, Donald Trump – isn’t waltzing to victory. Many Americans share the world’s bewilderment. National opinion polls may well continue to fluctuate until the election on November 8. But Trump has been closing in on Clinton in recent weeks, even threatening to catch up with her in the Electoral College vote, where the Democrats’ control of some of the most populous states (New York and California) give Clinton an advantage. Why is this happening? For starters, Trump, despite knowing almost nothing about governance or public policy, has managed to consolidate most Republicans behind him. One motivation is Republicans’ long-held hatred of Clinton. Another is the Supreme Court; the court already has one vacant seat for the next president to fill and is likely to have more over the next four years. Trump has also exploited many Americans’ economic anxieties, tapping the same anti-immigrant, anti-elite rage that is sweeping across European countries. But Trump cannot win by appealing only to white men without a college degree. So he has been clumsily trying to suggest that he also cares about African Americans and Latinos – not by talking to African-American and Latino voters, but by speaking in exaggerated stereotypes about them to white audiences. Not surprisingly, African-Americans and Latinos consider his comments insensitive and patronizing; white women – his real target audience – haven’t yet been persuaded, either. Meanwhile, Clinton is having her own difficulties reconstructing President Barack Obama’s coalition of women, African Americans, Latinos, and millennials. Many young people who passionately supported Clinton’s Democratic primary opponent, Senator Bernie Sanders, have ignored Sanders’s own admonitions to support Clinton, and are saying that they’ll vote for third-party candidates, which would help Trump. Since the two major parties’ national conventions in July, each candidate has alternately made gains and suffered losses. This month, just as Trump was rising in the polls, he attempted to separate himself from the racist “birther” movement, which falsely claims that Obama – America’s first black president – wasn’t born in the United States, and thus was ineligible for the presidency. Trump’s remarks, terse and grudging, reminded everyone that he himself was one of the loudest “birthers” of all. His damage-control effort further backfired, because he falsely claimed that Clinton and her 2008 presidential campaign had started the birther rumor. Many news outlets finally used the word “lie” in their coverage of Trump, who had gone essentially unchallenged on past fabrications. Trump’s recent polling gains say less about his improvement as a candidate than they do about Clinton’s own weaknesses and bad luck. Outside her base of passionate loyalists, Clinton has always had a voter-enthusiasm problem. She comes across to many as a packaged know-it-all, the super-smart girl who put off the boys in school. And she confronts a fair amount of sexism, even among her supporters. (A former Democratic governor recently declared that she should smile more. Would he have said that about a man?) But Clinton has also created some of her own problems. Her poor judgment in using a private email server as Secretary of State, thereby risking the disclosure of classified material, has become a chronic burden for her campaign. She compounded the problem when she claimed, falsely, that her predecessors had done the same thing, and that State Department security officials had cleared it. And, unlike Trump, she received no deference from the press on this issue. The email saga added to voters’ long-held impression that Clinton isn’t “honest and trustworthy,” and it exposed her to attacks from adversaries on the right. The highly conservative advocacy group Judicial Watch has continually called attention to the issue, forcing the disclosure of emails that Clinton hadn’t turned over to the State Department. (The FBI found nearly 15,000 emails on Clinton’s server that she hadn’t provided.) Numerous as-yet-undisclosed emails with the potential to damage Clinton may well be released before the election. While FBI Director James Comey decided not to recommend prosecution of Clinton for the email issue, he hurt her campaign by commenting that she’d been “extremely careless.” In any case, the choice not to prosecute had Republicans and conservative commentators howling that she’d received preferential treatment from the Democratic administration. Polls showed that 56% of respondents agreed that Clinton should have been prosecuted. A new issue for Clinton arose in August, when the Associated Press reported that numerous donors to the Clinton Foundation had received special treatment by the State Department during Clinton’s tenure there, mainly by winning an appointment with her. But many of these people would have received an appointment anyway; and there is no evidence that State Department policies were changed as a result. Meanwhile, the Washington Post has begun to report on questionable – possibly illegal – expenditures by Trump’s own charitable foundation. Trump, who hadn’t donated to his foundation since 2008, subsequently used its funds to buy personal items (including a six-foot portrait of himself) and to pay legal settlements. Previously, it had also been disclosed that funds from the Trump Foundation had been used to contribute to the election campaigns of attorneys-general in Florida and Texas, which would also be illegal. Finally, Clinton had the bad luck of falling ill, with cellphone video showing her nearly collapsing as she left early a ceremony in New York City commemorating the September 11, 2001, terrorist attack. This added further fuel to right-wing media speculation that she is in poor health; Trump added the sexist charge that she lacks the “stamina” to be president. The press covering Clinton were furious to learn that twodays earlier she had been diagnosed with pneumonia and had kept it to herself. But American presidential elections are brutal marathons, and it’s understandable that she did not want to cancel planned events. A later poll showed that the majority of the public agreed. Clinton’s four-day convalescence came just as she was preparing to make the case for why people should vote for her, rather than why they shouldn’t vote for Trump. Just as she resumed campaigning, there were bombings in New York and New Jersey, and two more police shootings of unarmed African Americans, which spurred demonstrations in North Carolina, a swing state. The events took over the national dialogue, with Trump, as usual, playing on racial divisions and blaming Obama and Clinton. This is the background against which the candidates will head into face-to-face debates, which tend to play a large (even excessive) role in shaping US elections. It would be unwise to call this election over before it is.",
            "美国总统竞争为何如此接近？ 华盛顿—全世界很多人可能正在奇怪为何希拉里·克林顿 — — 她显然比她的对手唐纳德·特朗普准备更充分，也更适合当美国总统 — — 没有势如破竹。 许多美国人也有这样的疑惑。 在11月8日的大选开始前，全国民调很可能将继续摇摆。 但最近几周，特朗普一直在追近希拉里，甚至有望在选举人团（Electoral College）投票中追上她。 民主党控制着一些人口最多的州（纽约州和加利福尼亚州 ） ， 这给了克林顿优势。 为什么会这样？ 首先，特朗普尽管对于治国和公共政策几乎一无所知，但他成功地将大部分共和党人团结在自己背后。 一个动机是共和党对克林顿由来已久的恨意。 另一个动机是最高法院；最高法院已经空出了一个席位，将由下任总统来填补，并且在未来四年中可能还有更多空位。 特朗普还利用了许多美国人的经济焦虑，煽动与横扫欧洲诸国类似的反移民、反精英愤怒。 但特朗普不可能只凭借诉诸没有大学文凭的白人男性赢得选举。 因此他一直在笨拙地试图证明他也顾及非洲裔美国人和拉丁裔 — — 不仅仅通过与非洲裔美国人和拉丁裔选民对话，也通过以夸张的语调在白人听众前谈及他们。 毫不奇怪，非洲裔美国人和拉丁裔认为他的评论愚蠢又傲慢；白人女性 — — 他的真正目标听众 — — 也没有被说服。 与此同时，克林顿在重建奥巴马总统的女性、非洲裔美国人、拉丁裔和千禧一代联盟方面也遇到了困难。 许多年轻人热烈支持克林顿的民主党初选对手、参议员伯尼·桑德斯（Bernie Sanders ） ， 现在他们忽视桑德斯本人支持克林顿的劝诫，称他们将投票给其他党派候选人，这将有助于特朗普。 自7月份两党召开全国大会以来，两位候选人彼此有得有失。 本月，在特朗普在民调中得势的同时，他试图将自己与种族主义“出身论”运动划清界线，后者子虚乌有地宣称美国首任黑人总统奥巴马并非出生在美国，因此没有资格当美国总统。 特朗普简短而勉强的声明提醒所有人，他本人便是最顽固的“出身论”者之一。 他的止损举动带来了更多的副作用，因为他错误地宣称克林顿及其2008年总统选战是从出身论流言开始的。 许多新闻媒体最后都用“说谎”一词来报道特朗普，他过去的诸多信口开河基本上都没有受到过挑战。 特朗普最近在民调中得势与其说是因为他作为候选人有所进步，不如说是因为克林顿自己的弱势和倒霉。 除了她的基本盘，克林顿一直面临着选民热情问题。 对许多人来说，她的形象是万事通，就像学校里令男生汗颜的“学霸 ” 。 她还面临着相当大的性别歧视，即使在她的支持者中也是如此。 （一位前民主党州长最近宣称她应该更多地微笑。 他会这样评论男候选人吗？ ） 但克林顿自己也给自己制造了一些麻烦。 她在担任国务卿期间使用私人邮件服务器，从而导致保密材料有可能泄露，这表明她判断力糟糕，也是她选战中的一个永远的污点。 她错误地宣称她的前任也这么做过，并且国务院安全官员已经清理了邮件，这让问题更加复杂化了。 此外，与特朗普不同，在这个问题上，她没有获得媒体的尊重。 “邮件门”加强了选民由来已久的克林顿不“诚实可信”的印象，也让她饱受右翼对手的攻讦。 高度保守的游说团体司法观察（Judicial Watch）一直在鼓吹关注这一问题，施压披露克林顿没有转交国务院的邮件。 （联邦调查局在克林顿的服务器上找到了近1,500封她没有提供的邮件。 ）为数巨大的尚未披露邮件可能在选举前公之于众，危及克林顿的选情。 尽管联邦调查局局长詹姆斯·科梅（James Comey）决定不建议就邮件问题起诉克林顿，但仍评论说她“非常不谨慎 ” ， 这将危及克林顿的选情。 无论如何，不起诉的选择让共和党和保守派评论家猛烈评级她从民主党政府中获得特殊优待。 民调显示56%的受访者同意克林顿应该被起诉。 8月份，克林顿又有了一个新问题。 美联社报道众多克林顿基金会捐赠者在克林顿任职国务卿期间获得了国务院的特殊对待，主要形式是通过她获得任命。 但这些人中有许多本来就可以获得任命；并无证据表明国务院政策因此被改变。 与此同时 ， 《 华盛顿邮报》开始报道特朗普本人的慈善基金会的可疑 — — 有可能非法 — — 支出。 特朗普自2008年以来便再未向基金会捐资，但使用基金会资金购买个人物品（包括衣服他本人的六英尺画像）和支付法律和解费用。 此前，据披露特朗普基金会资金还被用于佛罗里达州和德克萨斯州检察长的竞选活动，这也是非法的。 最后，克林顿不幸生病，手机视频显示，在9月11日出席纽约市恐怖袭击纪念仪式时她在离开时险些跌倒。 这进一步助长了右翼媒体猜测她健康有问题；特朗普更是发动性别攻击，说她缺少当总统的“耐力 ” 。 克林顿团队先是说她太疲劳了，后来又披露她两天前被诊断为肺炎。 许多媒体对她不早点披露这一信心感到愤怒。 但美国总统选战是一场残酷的马拉松，她不想取消计划行程完全可以理解。 随后的民调显示大部分公众也同意这一点。 克林顿为期四天的康复期正逢她准备向人们解释为什么要投票给她，而不是不投票给特朗普。 她一回归选战，纽约和新泽西就爆发了爆炸事件，更有两起警察枪击未携带武器的非洲裔美国人事件，导致摇摆州加利福尼亚北部爆发游行示威。 这些事件占据了全国对话的焦点，而特朗普像往常一样利用种族分歧并指责奥巴马和克林顿。 在这样的背景下，两位候选人将进行面对面辩论，而辩论将给美国选情造成巨大（甚至过度）的影响。 在此之前就宣布选举结束是不明智的。"

            "Pulling the OMT Trigger CHICAGO – Europe has been experiencing a period of calm after the storm since European Central Bank President Mario Draghi’s “whatever it takes” speech in July and the ECB’s decision in September to proceed with its “outright monetary transactions” (OMT) program to purchase distressed eurozone members’ government bonds. The interest-rate spreads for Italian and Spanish government bonds have dropped dramatically, corporate-bond issues have resumed, and a sense of normalcy is slowly pervading the continent. But it would be foolish to conclude that the euro’s problems have been solved. The economic fundamentals are far from stable, while the reduced financial tension is the fortunate outcome of an expectation game. As long as investors believe that Italy and Spain will eventually be rescued by the OMT, these countries’ borrowing costs will be low, and the rescue will not be needed. If, however, the slightest doubt about the OMT’s effectiveness arises, the expectation game will shift into reverse, and both countries’ bonds will quickly come under attack. One such source of doubt may be the OMT’s safety catch. To become operational, all European governments must approve it. The rules vary among EU countries, but, in Germany, “government approval” implies parliamentary approval. In an emergency situation, it is difficult to imagine that Germany will not prefer approval to the disaster of an Italian or Spanish default. Still, any delay could be enough to trigger a bank run in either country. By the time the German Bundestag decided, it could be too late. To eliminate this uncertainty, Italy and Spain should ask for the OMT intervention before it is desperately needed – a request that the Bundestag would most likely approve, viewing it as an insurance scheme rather than a pure transfer. Doing so would also eliminate the uncertainty surrounding the program itself and its implementation mechanisms. Identifying and addressing problems when intervention is not urgently needed is much easier than working them out under the threat of a pending sovereign default. Finally, an early request for OMT intervention would not only reduce the Italian and Spanish governments’ borrowing costs (and thus their fiscal deficits), but would also lower the cost of capital for local firms, which currently find it difficult to borrow and invest. Thus, it would provide a much-needed boost to these countries’ struggling economies. So, if triggering OMT intervention would be so beneficial, why are the Spanish and Italian governments so reluctant to do so? The main reason is political. In the 1930’s, all European governments feared that breaking from the gold standard would be perceived as a sign of weakness. As a result, they waited too long. The same is true of the OMT program: elected politicians fear that triggering it would be perceived as a sign of weakness, implying a cost that they have a strong incentive to delay paying. But why is Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti, who is not an elected politician (and has promised not to run for election), so hesitant? Given that he does not have to fear electoral defeat, he could help Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy by filing first, which would weaken the political stigma for Rajoy’s government were it to file subsequently. Triggering OMT now would also be a safe play for Italy in the face of an imminent general election with a highly uncertain outcome. What is not uncertain is that an anti-euro party, run by a professional comedian, Beppe Grillo, will gain at least 20% of the Italian vote. The political instability that could ensue would not provide a good opportunity to ask Germany for help. In fact, if one were to imagine reasons why Germany might not approve a request by Italy to trigger the OMT, political turmoil would top the list. By contrast, triggering the OMT in advance would promote political stability in the face of uncertainty, because it would tie the hands of any future Italian government. Why, then, is Monti not acting? One possible reason is personal pride. Monti wants to be remembered as the prime minister who saved Italy from disaster. He does not want to go down in history as the prime minister who had to surrender Italy’s sovereignty to save the country from default. An alternative explanation is that Monti does indeed have political ambitions. While Monti’s mandate was set to last until the election, he might be trying to extend it with the support of the new parliament. Delay for either of these reasons would be a very selfish act. Monti should not risk European stability for his personal benefit. He should trigger OMT before it is too late.",
            "扳下OMT扳机 芝加哥—自欧洲央行行长德拉吉7月“竭尽所能”演讲以及欧洲央行9月决定采取“直接货币交易 ” （ OMT）买入受困欧元区成员国政府债券后，欧洲经历着稳定期。 意大利和西班牙政府的利差大幅下降，公司债券发行重现江湖，欧洲大陆也开始逐渐弥漫恢复正常的感觉。 但这样就认为欧元问题已被解决是愚蠢的。 经济基本面远远称不上稳定，尽管预期游戏产生了财政压力纾解的幸运效果。 只要投资者认为意大利和西班牙最终能够被OMT所救，这些国家的借贷成本就将保持低位，救援也就没有必要实施。 不过，如果人们对OMT的作用产生哪怕是最轻微的质疑，预期游戏就将向相反的地方发展，两国债券将马上受到攻击。 质疑原因之一的OMT的安全阀装置。 为了使其可操作，所有欧洲国家政府都必须批准它。 各个欧盟国家的规则各不相同，但在德国 ， “ 政府批准”意味着议会批准。 在紧急情况下，很难想象德国会放任意大利或西班牙违约而不批准OMT。 但是，任何拖延都有可能足以出发意大利或西班牙的银行挤兑。 到德国议会作出决定的时候，说不定一切都太晚了。 为了消除这一不确定性，意大利和西班牙应该要求OMT在不得不出手之前就进行干预 — — 这一要求德国议会很可能会批准，将其视为一种保险机制，而不仅仅是转移支付。 如此还能消除围绕在OMT计划本身及其实施机制的不确定性。 在干预并非迫切需要的时候识别并纠正问题要比受到迫在眉睫的主权违约的威胁时才动手更容易。 最后，早早要求OMT干预不但可以降低意大利和西班牙政府的借贷成本（从而降低它们的财政赤字 ） ， 还可以降低本地企业的资本成本，后者目前陷入了借贷和投资困境。 如此，OMT可以对这些深陷麻烦的国家提供急需的提振。 那么，既然触发OMT干预的好处是如此之大，为何西班牙和意大利政府不愿这样做？ 主要原因在于政治。 20世纪30年代，所有欧洲政府都害怕与金本位脱钩将被视为疲软的信号。 结果，它们等待了太长时间。 OMT也是如此：当选政客害怕触发OMT被视为示弱，这就构成了一种成本，他们有强烈的激励推迟该成本的发生。 但为何作为非当选（并承诺不参加竞选）的政客的意大利总理蒙蒂也如此犹豫？ 他不用担心在选举中被击败，可以成为第一个要求OMT干预者，从而助西班牙首相拉霍伊一臂之力 — — 如果拉霍伊政府在意大利之后才要求OMT干预，则它就不会面临多少政治难堪。 到现在，触发OMT也是意大利在面临即将到来的结果极不确定的大选时的安全之选。 确定的是，以职业喜剧演员格里洛（Beppe Grillo）为首的反欧元政党至少将在意大利大选中赢得20%的选票。 这可能引发政治动荡，不利于寻求德国的帮助。 事实上，如果你思考一下德国不批准意大利触发OMT的要求的原因，那么政治乱象肯定是首先冒出来的内容。 相反，提前触发OMT将增加面临不确定性时的政治稳定性，因为这能够束缚未来意大利政府的手脚。 既然如此，为什么蒙蒂无所作为？ 一个可能的原因是个人尊严。 蒙蒂希望以带领意大利走出灾难的总理被人铭记。 他不愿意在历史上留下将为避免主权��约而将意大利主权拱手出让的总理的名声。 另一个解释是蒙蒂确实怀有政治野心。 尽管其执政只能维持到大选，但他可能会在新议会的支持下谋求留任。 不管出于哪种原因，不作为都是自私的行为。 蒙蒂不应该因为个人好处而将欧洲稳定性置于风险之中。 他应该在犹未为晚时触发OMT。"

            "Italy’s French Temptation FLORENCE – Italy is once again being gulled by the false hope that if it can just “fix” its institutions, its politics will normalize. This time, it is the French model that is enticing Italy’s leaders. Since February’s inconclusive general election, Italian lawmakers have managed to agree on only one thing: the reelection of 88-year-old President Giorgio Napolitano, which makes him the first two-term president since Italy abolished the monarchy in 1946. The main center-left and center-right parties that supported Napolitano – despite the protests of Beppe Grillo and his anti-establishment Five Star Movement, which won a quarter of the parliamentary vote – hope that he can oversee the creation of a broad-based coalition government. But addressing Italy’s myriad institutional weaknesses – which have led to ungovernability, endemic fragmentation, disfattismo (defeatism), and widespread public frustration with the establishment – will require an overhaul of the country’s political system. Given that France overcame similar weaknesses and political deadlock with the creation of the Fifth Republic, which includes a robust executive led by a powerful president, the French model seems like an effective one to follow. Indeed, at first glance, pursuing such a change in Italy appears simple. Perhaps it is not surprising that Italians admire France’s Fifth Republic. After all, its governments – unlike those in Italy – have been remarkably stable and relatively durable, lasting 643 days, on average. Moreover, no one party or figure has dominated French politics for too long, with power alternating regularly between parties of the left and the right, at least since François Mitterrand’s first victory in 1981. But, for many Italians, the French political system’s most attractive feature is that the president is the true head of the executive – and, since the presidential and legislative terms were aligned in 2000, that authority has run for five years at a time. To Italian lawmakers, mired in stalemate and indecision, the French executive’s considerable influence over the parliament is appealing. That influence is bolstered by the electoral rules’ inherent bias in favor of powerful parties. Indeed, no electoral system creates a greater vote-seat distortion than France’s two-round majoritarian system. For example, in 2012, the Socialists obtained nearly 50% of the seats in the National Assembly, despite having won only 29% of the vote in the first round. The right-wing RPR-UDF coalition did even better in 1993, when it won 38.5% of the vote in the first round but obtained an astonishing 82% of the seats. In France, smaller parties can gain parliamentary seats only if they manage to negotiate a pre-election agreement with one of the major parties to secure for them some constituencies. One could argue that this system facilitates more efficient governance, and thus could potentially save Italy from its debilitating gridlock. But it is difficult to see how it is good for democracy. Before becoming overly enamored of French institutions, Italians should consider what the French think of their own system. In fact, the French are extremely frustrated with their country’s politics, particularly with their presidents. This dissatisfaction does not reflect a failure of François Hollande, whose approval rating stands at only 26% one year into his presidential term; his two immediate predecessors, Jacques Chirac and Nicolas Sarkozy, also left office in disgrace. According to Eurobarometer data collected over the last two decades, Italy’s political system, its leaders, and its democratic institutions have the lowest level of citizen satisfaction among the first 15 European Union countries. But France is a close second. Likewise, France is second only to Italy when it comes to the desire to reform and restructure its political institutions. At the end of the day, there is no institutional reform that could miraculously “save” Italy. While a semi-presidential system like France’s could enable Italy to suppress symmetric bicameralism and reform the worst aspects of its electoral law (known as porcellum, or “the crap law”), thereby improving governability, it would create as many problems as it would solve. French history demonstrates that excessive presidential power is likely to create an almighty and, at times, politically feckless executive, alongside a weak parliament that chronically under-represents a significant proportion of the population. Beyond the incantatory formulas, Italians should reflect carefully on the desirability of adopting such a system.",
            "意大利的法国诱惑 佛罗伦萨—意大利再一次受了错误希望的骗，认为只要能够“修正”其制度，其政治就会正常化。 这一回，迷惑意大利领导人的是法国模式。 自2月份大选没有产生决定性结果以来，意大利立法者只在一个问题上形成了一致：88岁的纳波利塔诺再一次当选总统，成为自1946年意大利放弃君主制以来第一个连任的总统。 支持纳波利塔诺的主流中左翼和中右翼政党希望，在他的监督下，意大利能形成获得广泛支持的联合政府。 不过格里洛（Beppe Grillo）及其反对现状的五星运动党（Five Star Movement，该党赢得了议会选举的四分之一选票）反对纳波利塔诺。 但纠正意大利为数众多的制度弱点 — — 它们导致意大利无从治理，地方各自为政，失败主义盛行，以及公众对现状的普遍沮丧感 — — 要求改变该国的政治制度。 法国曾以建立第五共和国的方式 — — 其中包括强势总统领导下的稳健执政 — — 克服了类似的弱点和政治僵局，因此法国模式似乎是可供遵循的善例。 事实上，咋一看，意大利追求类似变化好像易如反掌。 也许意大利仰慕法国第五共和国并不令人奇怪。 毕竟，其政府 — — 与意大利政府不同 — — 令人注目地稳定和相对持久，平均执政时间为643天。 此外，没有哪个政党或个人能主宰法国政治太长时间，权力定期在左翼和右翼政党之间交替，至少自1981年密特朗首次获选以来是如此。 但是，对许多意大利人来说，法国政治制度最吸引人的特征是其总统乃是真正的执政首脑 — — 而自2000年总统和立法任期统一以来，每五年选举一次。 对陷于僵局和犹豫的意大利立法者来说，法国行政影响力远高于议会的状态吸引力极大。 这一影响力来自选举规则有利于强势政党的内在偏向性。 事实上，没有哪种选举制度能比法国的两轮多数制度更能制造选票-席位扭曲的了。 比如，2012年法国社会党在国民大会（National Assembly）中赢得近50%的席位，尽管它在第一轮选举中只获得了29%的选票。 右翼的PDR-UDF联盟在1993年的表现甚至更加出色，它在第一轮选举中赢得38.5%的选票，但最终赢得了惊人的82%的议席。 在法国，小政党要想获得议院席位，必须设法在选举前与某大政党达成协议，以确保拿下一些选区。 你可能会说，这一制度有利于更高效的治理，因此可能把意大利从令人疲敝的僵局中拯救出来。 但很难看到这对民主有什么好处。 在过度沉迷于法国制度之前，意大利应该考虑一下法国人如何看待自己的制度。 事实上，法国人对自己国家的政治感到无比失望，特别是对他们的总统。 这一不满不光体现在奥朗德的失败上 — — 在问鼎总统宝座仅仅一年后，他的支持率只有26 % ； 他的两位前任，希拉克和萨科齐，离职时���颇不体面。 根据欧洲晴雨表（Eurobarometer）在过去二十年中所收集的数据，以人民满意度衡量，意大利的政治制度、它的领导人以及它的民主机构在第一批15个欧盟国家中叨陪末座。 但法国也只是倒数第二。 类似地，在人民改革和重组政治制度意愿排名上，意大利名列第一，而紧随其后的也正是法国。 所到底，没有哪种制度改革能奇迹般地“拯救”意大利。 尽管类似法国的半总统制能让意大利遏制其对称两院制并改革其选举法中最糟糕的的部分（被称为“porecellum ” ， 即“废话法律 ” ） ，从而改善其可治理性，但也它所带来的问题一点也不比它所解决问题少。 法国历史表明，总统权力过大可能会形成人造神，有时也会造成政治上软弱的执政者，以及长期无法代表人口大部的弱势议会。 意大利应该破除迷信，认真考虑是否应该追求这样一套制度。"

            "The Politics of Frustration in Latin America PRINCETON – All over Latin America, public patience is wearing thin, with violence in Chile and the return to power of Peronists in Argentina. For almost 40 years, leaders and voters have struggled to realign economies with global markets, leavening the adjustment with social policies to protect the worst-off. Center-right and center-left coalitions agreed on broad strokes. While they argued over taxes and other issues, Latin Americans accepted the need for foreign markets and foreign investment. For the past ten years, however, world trade has slowed. The World Trade Organization predicts anemic growth of 3% at best. Trade wars, stalled treaties, and the return of economic nationalism pose a real threat to Latin Americans and others who depend on foreign markets. To make matters worse, income inequality has widened. Already the world’s most unfair region in this regard, Latin America had made some progress before 2015. But slower GDP growth and stumbling social policies have reversed the trend since then. Latin American leaders across the political spectrum find themselves in a bind. As the world turned its back on globalization and open borders in favor of national and regional blocs, pro-globalization governments faced the yearnings of voters who took seriously the promise of economic rights and social wellbeing. At the same time, appeals to tradition, family, and property have proved to be seductive for a growing part of the population, fueling support for Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro, Peru’s Keiko Fujimori, or even Chile’s José Antonio Kast. People are impatient and indignant. Argentina has been in an economic tailspin since 2017. Real wages have fallen. Poverty is up. Two years earlier, in 2015, Mauricio Macri won the presidency on his promise that fiscal adjustment and opening Argentina to the world would spur economic revival. Instead, they paved the way for his defeat. In a few short years, the package of pro-market reforms and economic opening seemed out of step with the rest of the world. Deglobalization, nativism, and protectionism set a new tone for politics, with frustration and uncertainty about the future overshadowing hope. Frustration is even afflicting the region’s paragon of open-market politics, Chile. On October 18, a wave of protests led President Sebastián Piñera’s government to rely on gendarmes, rubber bullets, and tear gas to repress rioting and looting. During the ensuing week, the world watched images that seemed to contradict the stability of the “Chilean model.” The riots and the bloody response of the army and the carabineros were followed by videos of Piñera, surrounded by men in fatigues, declaring that the country was “at war,” rhetoric that triggered memories of Augusto Pinochet’s 17-year military dictatorship. Despite Chile’s impressive economic growth and poverty reduction since the dictatorship’s end in 1990, inequality loomed large, and those who have yet to see the benefits have run out of patience. Even progressive governments seem to have run out of time. A few weeks earlier, when Ecuador’s government announced a reduction in fuel subsidies, a wave of popular unrest forced the government of President Lenin Moreno to flee the capital, Quito. Heir to the center-left government of Rafael Correa, Moreno had turned to the International Monetary Fund and subscribed to a program of fiscal cuts. As in Chile, massive street demonstrations were met by severe repression. In the end, Moreno had to mothball the controversial policies to restore peace. In some cases, malaise has led to paralysis. In Peru, the resignation of President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski in March 2018 only emboldened the populist forces of fujimorismo in Congress and prompted demonstrations denouncing the illegitimacy of Peruvian politicians. The shutdown of the Congress last month by the current president, Martín Vizcarra, casts doubt on the country’s future. Then there are the shockwaves from Bolsonaro’s victory in Brazil’s presidential election last year, which brought an end to the country’s long-standing center-left consensus and ushered in a new regime of cronyism and incivility. With the IMF predicting economic growth this year of 0.8%, it’s hard to say how long Bolsonaro’s incendiary rhetoric will keep his supporters happy. Time might be running out for him, too. Each country is going through its own drama. But what is clear across the region is that as the fabric of global integration comes undone, Latin American governments face spiking popular dissatisfaction and a sharp downturn in public confidence in governments and institutions. The result is an escalation of protest and repressive responses, turning modest demonstrations into massive conflicts. So far, the outlier is Argentina, where the social unrest is being channeled through elections. It is worth recalling, however, that many who voted for the Peronists once voted for Macri’s free-market reforms. How long they will wait for Alberto Fernández’s promises to bear fruit is unclear. While the new president is a wily pragmatist, even he knows that voters’ loyalties, especially when pressed to the limit of subsistence, are unstable. Something fundamental has changed. Latin America cannot hitch its fortunes to the fading promises of globalization. Nor cannot it return to old-style populism. The only certainty is that the public’s fuse is short; many years of promises have dashed expectations at a time when the future looks especially bleak. This is not the same kind of unrest seen in Beirut or Hong Kong, where people are taking to the streets to fight undemocratic regimes. This is about economic frustration, amplified by the seeming absence of alternatives to failed globalization. The risk, of course, is that governments resort to Chinese-style tactics and turn economic malaise into a struggle over the future of democracy. Piñera’s ominous talk of an internal war, while surrounded by uniformed military officers, does not bode well.",
            "拉丁美洲的失望政治学 普林斯顿—放眼拉丁美洲，公众耐心日益耗尽，智利出现了暴力，而阿根廷则面临着庇隆主义者重新掌权。 近40年来，领导人和选民都难以重整经济，与全球市场接轨，这便影响到保护后进群体的社会政策的调整。 中右翼和中左翼联盟在总体框架上是一致的。 拉丁美洲人民在税收和其他问题上有着分歧，但都认同需要外国市场和外国投资。 但在过去十年中，世界贸易已经放缓。 世界贸易组织预测，萎靡的增长最多只有3 % 。 贸易战、条约停滞以及经济民族主义的回归给拉丁美洲人和其他依靠外国市场的群体带来了切实威胁。 更糟糕的是，收入不平等性有所扩大。 拉丁美洲本是全世界最不公平地区，2015年前，他们在平等性方面取得了一些进步。 但随后GDP增长放缓和糟糕的社会政策让这一趋势被逆转。 拉丁美洲领导人，不论出身哪个政治派别，都身陷困境。 随着世界远离全球化和开放边境，转向国家和地区结盟，亲全球化的政府面临着把经济权利和社会福利承诺当真的选民的渴望。 与此同时，传统、家庭和产权的吸引力对于部分群体日益增加，促使他们支持巴西的博尔索纳罗，秘鲁的藤森庆子和智利的卡斯特（José Antonio Kast ） 。 人们已经失去耐心，愤懑满腔。 2017年后，阿根廷陷入了经济混乱。 真实工资下降。 贫困增加。 在此之前两年，即2015年，马克里凭借财政调整和向世界开放能够刺激经济复兴的承诺赢得总统选举。 最终，这些承诺成为他的掘墓人。 短短几年后，亲市场和经济开放的改革计划与世界其他部分显得格格不入。 去全球化、本土论和保护主义成为政治新基调，而失望和未来的不确定性压倒了希望。 失望甚至正在席卷拉丁美洲地区开放市场政治的典范 — — 智利。 10月18日，示威风潮让总统皮涅拉政府不得不出动宪兵队、橡皮子弹和催泪瓦斯镇压暴乱和打劫。 在接下来的一周中，世界看到的是与稳定的“智利模式”截然相反的景象。 暴乱和军方和武警（carabineros）的血腥镇压之后，皮涅拉出现在视频画面中，四周是面露疲相的随从，他宣布智利处于“战争状态 ” ， 这番话让人想起了匹诺切特17年的军事独裁。 1990年匹诺切特独裁结束以来，智利取得了令人印象深刻的经济增长和减贫成果，但不平等性仍然很高，那些始终得不到好处的人终于丧失了耐心。 就连进步派政府，似乎也已经来日无多。 几周前，厄瓜多尔政府宣布将减少燃料补贴，结果引起了一波群众骚乱，迫使总统莫雷诺政府逃离首都基多。 作为中左翼的科雷拉政府的继任者，莫雷诺求助于国际货币基金组织，采取了财政减支计划。 和智利一样，大规模街头示威受到了严酷镇压。 最终，莫雷诺不得不收回争议政策以恢复和平。 在某些情形中，小恙造成了大患。 在秘鲁，2018年卡钦斯基总统的辞职让国会中的民粹主义滕森派（fujimorismo）愈加有恃无恐，并引发了宣布秘鲁政客非法的示威。 上个月，现任总统维兹卡拉关闭了议会，让人们对秘鲁的未来感到怀疑。 还有去年博尔索纳罗在巴西总统竞选中胜出所造成的冲击波，这意味着巴西存在已久的中左翼共识的结束，以及裙带主义和肆意妄为的新政权的上台。 IMF预测巴西今年经济增长率为0.8 % ， 很难说博尔索纳罗的煽动风格能够取悦支持者多久。 他可能也没有多少时间了。 每个国家有每个国家的问题。 但纵观整个地区，有一件事是清楚的，那就是，随着全球融合趋势的式微，拉丁美洲政府面临着愈演愈烈的群中不满和政府和制度的公共信心的急剧下降。 结果是示威和镇压的升级，将温和示威转变为大规模冲突。 到目前为止，阿根廷是一个“异类 ” ， 社会动乱通过选举得到了疏导。 但是，我们值得回忆一下，投票给庇隆主义者的选民中，有很多人当初也投票给了马克里的自由市场改革。 他们能够等待多久让费尔南德兹的承诺落实，我们不得而知。 新总统是一个左右逢源的务实派，但他也知道，选民的忠诚，特别是在被生存压迫到极致的时候，是非常不稳定的。 一些基本面已经发生了变化。 拉丁美洲无法将命运寄托于渐行渐远的全球化憧憬。 拉丁美洲也无法回到旧式民粹主义。 唯一的确定性是，公众的“保险丝”非常短；多年来的承诺已经击碎了前景黯淡时期的期望。 这不同于贝鲁特和香港的动乱，那里的人民走上街头是为了反抗不民主的体制。 拉丁美洲的示威是因为经济不满，并因为看不到有什么能够替代失败的全球化而加剧。 当然，风险在于政府诉诸中国式的策略，将经济萎靡转变为民主的未来的斗争。 制服军官簇拥左右的皮涅拉的内战论让人颇感不安。"

            "Democracy on a Knife-Edge CAMBRIDGE – In Mohammed Hanif’s novel Red Birds, an American bomber pilot crashes his plane in the Arabian desert and is stranded among the locals in a nearby refugee camp. He finds himself talking about thieves with a local shopkeeper. “Our government is the biggest thief,” he explains. “It steals from the living, it steals from the dead.” The shopkeeper replies, “Thank God we don’t have that problem. We just steal from each other.” This little vignette just about summarizes the key message of Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson’s new book, The Narrow Corridor: States, Societies, and the Fate of Liberty. Acemoglu and Robinson’s thesis is that prospects for freedom and prosperity balance on a knife-edge between state oppression and the lawlessness and violence that society so often inflicts on itself. Give the state too much of an upper hand over society, and you have despotism. Render the state weak vis-à-vis society, and you get anarchy. As the book’s title signals, there is only a “narrow corridor” between these two dystopias, a slender path that only a few countries, mostly in the industrialized West, have managed to find. Furthermore, getting on the path does not guarantee staying on it. Acemoglu and Robinson emphasize that unless civil society remains vigilant and is able to mobilize against would-be autocrats, authoritarian regress always remains a possibility. Acemoglu and Robinson’s new book builds on their previous blockbuster, Why Nations Fail. In that book and other writings, they identified what they call “inclusive institutions” as the principal driver of economic and political progress. These institutions, such as secure property rights and the rule of law, are accessible to all (or most) citizens and do not favor a narrow group of elites over the rest of society. One country that has always given the Acemoglu-Robinson thesis some trouble is China. The Communist Party of China’s monopoly of political power, the country’s rampant corruption, and the ease with which the Party’s economic competitors and political opponents can be dispossessed hardly smack of inclusive institutions. Yet it is undeniable that over the last four decades the Chinese regime has achieved unprecedented rates of economic growth and the most impressive reduction in poverty in recorded history. In Why Nations Fail, Acemoglu and Robinson argued that Chinese economic growth will run out of steam unless extractive political institutions give way to inclusive institutions. They double down on this thesis in The Narrow Corridor. They characterize China as a country where a strong state has dominated society for almost two and a half millennia. Having spent so much time outside the corridor, they argue, it is unlikely that China can make a smooth entry back in. Neither political reform nor continued rapid economic growth seems likely. The other large country that now seems to sit ill at ease with the original Acemoglu-Robinson thesis is the United States. At the time Why Nations Fail was written, many still considered the US a prime example of inclusive institutions – a country that got rich and became democratic through the development of secure property rights and the rule of law. Today, the income distribution of the US is as skewed as in any plutocracy. And the country’s representative political institutions, under attack from a demagogue, look decidedly brittle. The Narrow Corridor seems to be written in part to provide an account of the apparent fragility of liberal democracies. The authors coin the term “Red Queen Effect” to denote the ever-continuing struggle to uphold open political institutions. Like the character in the Lewis Carroll book, civil society has to run ever faster to keep up with authoritarian leaders and restrain their despotic tendencies. The ability of civil society to stand up to “Leviathan” may in turn depend on social divisions and their evolution. Democracy typically emerges from the rise of popular groups that can challenge the power of the elites or from splits among elites. In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, industrialization, world wars, and de-colonization led to the mobilization of such groups. Ruling elites acceded to their opponents’ demands that the franchise be extended, without property qualifications, (usually) to all males. In return, the newly enfranchised groups accepted limits on their ability to expropriate property holders. In short, voting rights were exchanged for property rights. But, as I discuss in joint work with Sharun Mukand, liberal democracy requires more: rights that protect minorities (what we may call civil rights). The defining characteristic of the political settlement that generates democracy is that it excludes the main beneficiary of civil rights – minorities – from the bargaining table. These minorities have neither resources (like the elite) nor numbers (like the majority) behind them. The political settlement thus favors an impoverished kind of democracy – what one might call electoral democracy – over liberal democracy. This helps explain why liberal democracy is such a rare beast. The failure to protect minority rights is a readily understood consequence of the political logic behind the emergence of democracy. What requires explanation is not the relative rarity of liberal democracy, but its existence. The surprise is not that few democracies are liberal, but that there are any liberal democracies at all. This is hardly a comforting conclusion at a time when liberal democracy seems very much under threat, even in those parts of the world where it seems to have been permanently entrenched. But by appreciating the fragility of liberal democracy, we can perhaps avoid the lassitude induced by taking it for granted.",
            "刀刃上的民主 坎布里奇—在穆罕默德·哈尼夫的小说红鸟中，一名美国轰炸机飞行员驾驶的飞机在阿拉伯沙漠中坠毁，自己被困在当地的难民营。 他发现自己和一个当地店主谈论小偷。 “我们的政府是最大的小偷 ， ” 他解释道。 “它既偷活人也偷死人 。 ” 店主回答说 ， “ 感谢上帝，我们没有这个问题。 我们只互相偷 。 ” 这个小插曲恰恰概括了达伦·阿塞莫格鲁和詹姆斯·罗宾逊的新著狭窄的走廊：国家、社会和自由的命运的关键信息。 阿塞莫格鲁和罗宾逊的观点是，自由和繁荣的前景往往在国家压迫的刀刃和社会自身的无法无天和暴力活动中取得平衡。 如果赋予国家太多的社会支配权，就会产生独裁。 如果国家在社会面前太过软弱无力，人们就会面对无法无天。 正如这部新著的标题所表明的那样，在上述两种反面乌托邦之间仅仅存在一条“狭窄的走廊 ” ， 而迄今为止仅有少数几个国家（主要是西方工业化国家）成功找到了这条狭窄的出路。 此外，找到这条路并不意味着能一直走下去。 阿塞莫格鲁和罗宾逊强调，除非民间社会时刻保持警惕并全民动员反对潜在的独裁者，否则永远无法排除独裁倒退的可能。 阿塞莫格鲁和罗宾逊的新书建立在他们此前的畅销书国家为什么会失败的基础之上。 在那本著作和其他著作中，他们认为所谓的“包容性制度”是经济和政治进步的主要推动力量。 上述制度，如保障财产权和法治，全部面向所有（或绝大多数）民众，少部分精英团体并不享有超越社会其他部分的特权。 总是给阿塞莫格鲁和罗宾逊观点带来麻烦的一个国家是中国。 中国共产党对政治权力的垄断、该国猖獗的腐败以及党的经济竞争对手和政治反对者可以被轻易剥夺得一无所有很难令人想起包容性体制。 但不可否认的是，过去40年，中国政府已经实现了历史上前所未有的经济增长和成效最为卓著的减贫。 在国家为什么会失败一书中，阿塞莫格鲁和罗宾逊认为除非自上而下的政治体制能让位于包容性体制，否则中国的经济增长很难持续成功。 他们在狭窄的走廊一书中就这一论点进行了详尽的阐述。 他们认为中国是一个被强大的政府统治了近2，500年的社会。 他们认为，因为在走廊外待的时间过长，因此中国不太可能顺利重返走廊之内。 政治改革和持续快速的经济增长似乎都不可能。 似乎与阿塞莫格鲁和罗宾逊最初的论断相抵触的另外一个大国是美国。 在写作国家为什么会失败一书时，许多人仍然认为美国是包容性制度的主要典范 — — 这个国家通过保障财产权和法治而实现了民主和富足。 今天，美国收入分配的扭曲程度不亚于任何财阀当政的社会。 而该国的代表性政治体制在一位煽动者的攻击下似乎异常脆弱。 狭窄的走廊一书似乎在一定程度上说明了自由民主政体显而易见的脆弱性。 作者自创了术语“红桃皇后效应 ” ， 用来代指为维护开放政治体制而进行的从不停歇的斗争。 像刘易斯·卡罗尔书中的人物一样，公民社会必须以最快的速度跟上独裁领袖的步伐，并遏制他们的专制倾向。 公民社会抵抗“巨兽利维坦”的能力可能反过来取决于社会的分裂及其演进过程。 民主往往从有能力挑战精英权力或源自精英分裂的民众团体崛起中诞生。 在19及20世纪，工业化、世界大战和去殖民化导致这些团体诞生。 执政精英同意了对手的要求，即在不设定财产资格的情况下，将公民权扩大到所有男性。 作为回报，新得到公民权的团体接受了对其没收财产所有者能力的限制。 简言之，社会在投票权和财产权之间进行了交易。 但正如我在与夏伦·马坎德的合著中所探讨的那样，自由民主还需要保护少数群体权利（也就是我们口中所谓的民权）等其他因素。 产生民主的政治方案有一个决定性特点，那就是它将公民权利的主要受益者 — — 少数群体 — — 排除在谈判桌之外。 这些少数群体既不掌握资源（如精英）也不人多势众（如多数群体 ） 。 因此，与自由民主相比，最终政治方案更愿意接受一种贫瘠的民主 — — 也就是我们所谓的选举民主。 这有助于解释自由民主为什么如此罕见。 无法保护少数群体权利是民主产生背后政治逻辑的一个很容易理解的后果。 需要解释的不是自由民主的相对稀缺性，而是自由民主的存在。 令人意外的不是仅仅少数国家实现了自由民主，而是自由民主政体的存在。 值此自由民主遭受极大威胁之际，这并不是一个令人欣慰的结论，哪怕在那些自由民主看似一直根深蒂固的国家也不例外。 但通过了解自由民主的脆弱性，我们或许可以避免因为将其视为理所当然而产生的厌倦。"

            "Why the EU Election Was a Win for Macron PARIS – Though the final vote tally might seem to suggest otherwise, the European Parliament elections were a strategic success for French President Emmanuel Macron. There are four reasons why this is so. First, Macron succeeded in framing the election as a contest between progressives and populists. Though he has been assailed at home in recent months – including by some on his own “side” – it is worth remembering that this message did not emerge out of thin air. Rather, it harks back to Macron’s 2017 presidential campaign, which itself tapped into a broader political sea change taking place across Europe. In that election, he overcame the traditional right-left divide. Two years later, this was replicated in the European Parliament elections. Historically, the Republicans on the right and the Socialists on the left have dominated French politics. Yet these parties’ combined share of the popular vote was under 15%, whereas Macron’s La République en Marche ! won 22.4%, and the far-right National Rally (formerly the National Front) picked up 23.3%. Behind these figures is an unprecedented collapse of the mainstream French right, which has failed to reconcile identity politics with traditional liberalism. Though some French conservatives have migrated to the National Rally, much of the center-right electorate has gravitated toward Macron’s party, owing to efforts by Prime Minister Édouard Philippe (formerly of the Republicans). Moreover, most of those who switched to La République en Marche ! are pensioners who did so despite being hit hard by Macron’s tax reforms (some of which have been reversed). This suggests that Macron’s progressive-versus-populist narrative helped to re-mobilize France’s – and perhaps Europe’s – pro-European electorate. While the National Rally performed well and Italy’s right-wing League party made gains, they failed to trigger the EU-wide political earthquake that many had come to expect. The second reason the election represents a victory for Macron is that his party will now be able to claim leadership over a pivotal centrist parliamentary group of 110 members. The relative losses suffered by the European People’s Party (EPP) and the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&D), combined with the surge in support for the Greens, means that the European Parliament is entering a period of quadripartite governance. Provided these groups are able to compromise, the new arrangement will probably be an improvement on the old one, wherein the EPP and S&D divvied up all of the jobs. For the first time in the European Parliament’s history, the number of MEPs affiliated with the two main parties represents only 44% of the total. A more fluid parliamentary composition will allow for more ad hoc majorities to emerge in support of various policy proposals, given that there is so much common ground between La République en Marche !, the S&D, and the Greens. And, as an added bonus, the end of the EPP/S&D duopoly also marks the end of German hegemony in the Parliament. Third, the Spitzenkandidaten process – whereby the largest party grouping selects the president of the European Commission – is likely to collapse, and this may also work to Macron’s advantage. The system is a first-past-the-post mechanism in a proportionally elected Parliament, and has more to do with partisanship than with democracy, because it gives automatic power to the largest group. But while the EPP won the most parliamentary seats, its Spitzenkandidat, Manfred Weber, is very controversial. Just before the election, he was weakened by the political demise of Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, whose government was brought down by the release of a video in which his vice chancellor, Heinz-Christian Strache of the Freedom Party, appears to offer a quid pro quo for electoral help from Russia. But Merkel still defends Weber, and, apart from Macron and Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, most EU leaders are reluctant to confront the European Parliament on the Spitzenkandidaten issue. That may shorten the odds for Margrethe Vestager – who is not from the EPP, but who is, in a sense, a liberal Spitzenkandidat – while lengthening them for Michel Barnier, who is from the EPP but is not a Spitzenkandidat. If the Council succeeds in ruling out Weber and his populist supporters, Macron will claim it as a success. Finally, the election provides a check on German hegemony within the EU more broadly. Germany’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU) has been weakened, and the country’s Greens have grown stronger. For his part, Macron will find the Greens much easier to work with on eurozone reform, especially if they end up joining a new German coalition government. Taken together, these post-election considerations paint a rather positive picture for Macron. The question now is whether he can use his strength at the EU level to shore up his domestic position. This will not happen automatically. With the fall of the French right, there may be a temptation to position La République en Marche ! as a new home for right-wing French voters. But while this might capture Paris’s bourgeois 16th arrondissement, doing so would be a mistake. Instead, Macron should focus on securing more of the atomized left, particularly those who have moved to the National Rally. As matters stand, La République en Marche !’s base remains limited to the “winners” of globalization. Rural, alienated, and economically vulnerable voters remain in the National Rally’s camp. To win them over, Macron must reduce the polarization between the two parties.",
            "为什么欧盟选举是马克龙的胜利 巴黎 — — 尽管最终的计票结果表明情况似乎并非如此，但是欧洲议会选举对法国总统埃马纽埃尔·马克龙而言是一次战略上的成功，原因有四。 首先，马克龙成功地将此次选举框定为进步人士与民粹主义者之间的较量。 尽管近几个月来他一直受到国内的抨击，包括一些“站在他这边”的人 — — 但值得记住的是，这一信息并非空穴来风。 相反，追溯2017年马克龙的总统竞选，其本身就是欧洲正在发生的广泛的政治巨变。 在那次选举中，他克服了传统的左右翼分歧。 两年后，类似情况在欧洲议会选举中得到复制。 从历史上看，右翼的共和党和左翼的社会党主导着法国政治。 然而，这些政党在普选中所占的总份额还不到15 % ， 而马克龙所属政党“共和前进党 ” ( La Republique en Marche) 赢得22.4%的选票，极右翼的国民联盟(前身为国民阵线)获得23.3%的选票。 在这些数字的背后，法国主流右翼呈现出前所未有的崩溃，未能调和身份政治与传统自由主义之间的矛盾。 尽管一些法国保守派已转向国民联盟，但在总理爱德华·菲利普(Edouard Philippe，前共和党人)的努力下，许多中间偏右的选民转向了马克龙的政党。 更重要的是，大多数转向共和前进党的人是领取养老金的退休人员，尽管马克龙的税收改革(其中一些改革已经被取消)给了他们沉重的打击，但是他们还是予以支持。 这表明，马克龙关于进步人士与民粹主义者相较量的这一套说辞帮助重振了法国（或许还有欧洲）的亲欧选民。 尽管国民联盟表现良好，意大利右翼政党联盟党(League party)也有所斩获，但他们未能引发许多人所预期的席卷欧盟的政治地震。 对马克龙来说，此次选举代表着胜利的第二个原因是，他的政党现在将能够在一个由110名议员组成的关键中间派议会集团中占据领导地位。 欧洲人民党(EPP)和社会民主进步联盟(S&D)遭受的相对损失，再加上绿党支持率的飙升，意味着欧洲议会正进入四方执政时期。 如果这些政党能够相互妥协，新的安排可能会比旧的安排有所改进，而旧的安排是欧洲人民党和社会民主进步联盟承担所有的工作分配。 在欧洲议会历史上，欧洲议会两大主要政党的议员人数首次仅占总人数的44 % 。 鉴于共和前进党、社会民主进步联盟和绿党之间有如此多的共同点，一个更加灵活的议会组成将允许更多的“特别多数群体”出现，支持各种政策提案。 此外，作为额外的收获，欧洲人民党和社会民主进步联盟双头垄断的终结，也标志着德国在议会中霸权地位的结束。 第三 ， “ 热门人选”制度（Spitzenkandidaten process ） — —即最大的政党集团选择欧盟委员会总统的方式，可能会崩溃，而这也可能对马克龙是有利的。 该制度是按比例选举产生的议会中最高票者当选的一种机制，与民主相比，它更多地与党派有关，因为它自动赋予最大群体权力。 尽管欧洲人民党赢得了最多的议会席位，但它的“热门人选”曼弗雷德•韦伯却备受争议。 就在选举之前,他被奥地利总理塞巴斯蒂安·库尔兹的政府倒台削弱了力量。 在一段公开视频中，其自由党副总理海因茨·克里斯蒂安（Heinz-Christian）似乎以某种条件交换得到了来自俄罗斯的选举支援。 但默克尔仍在为韦伯辩护，而且，除了马克龙和荷兰首相马克·吕特(Mark Rutte)之外，大多数欧盟领导人都不愿在“热门人选”的问题上与欧洲议会正面交锋。 这可能会降低玛格丽特•维斯特格(Margrethe Vestager)的获胜几率，而米歇尔•巴尼耶(Michel Barnier)的获胜几率则有所增加。 维斯特格并非来自欧洲人民党，但在某种意义上，她是一位自由的“热门人选 ” 。 巴尼耶来自欧洲人民党，但并非“热门人选 ” 。 如果委员会成功地将韦伯和他的民粹主义支持者排除在外，马克龙将宣称这是一个成功。 最后，这次选举在更大范围内检验了德国在欧盟的霸权地位。 德国的基督教民主联盟(CDU)已经被削弱，而该国的绿党则变得更加强大。 就马克龙而言，他将发现绿党在欧元区改革方面更容易合作，尤其是如果他们最终会加入新的德国联合政府的话。 综上所述，这些选举后的考虑为马克龙描绘了一幅相当正面的图景。 现在的问题是，他能否利用自己在欧盟层面的实力来巩固自己在国内的地位。 这不会自动发生。 法国右翼势力的垮台可能诱使共和前进党成为法国右翼选民的新阵地。 尽管这可能会吸引巴黎资产阶级的第16区，但这样做将是一个错误。 相反，马克龙应该把重点放在争取更多被分裂的左派人士，尤其是那些已经加入国民联盟的人。 就目前情况来看，共和前进党的基础仍然局限于全球化的“赢家 ” 。 农村地区、偏远地区、经济上脆弱的选民仍然是国民联盟的阵营。 为了赢得他们的支持，马克龙必须减少两党之间的两极分化。"

            "Why Is Macron Hated? NEW YORK – France is not the United States. Many liberals, including me, worried that Marine Le Pen might just win the French presidency for the same reason that Donald Trump defeated Hillary Clinton in 2016: Loathing of the more liberal candidate would enable the far-right populist to squeak through. Fortunately, enough people who dislike President Emmanuel Macron held their noses and voted for him in the second-round runoff in order to thwart Le Pen. If one must choose between cholera and the plague, many voters stated, then the former was clearly the better option. Macron himself acknowledged as much in his victory speech, stating that, “To all those who voted for me, not in support of my ideas but to block the far right from winning, your vote obligates me.” But the fact that 41.5% of voters chose Le Pen, a candidate who represents a deeply reactionary, nativist, and illiberal strain in French politics, is still worrying enough. Why, then, do so many people hate Macron? The reasons French voters give for rejecting Macron are similar to those cited by US voters who could not bear Hillary Clinton. They are the candidate’s perceived arrogance, entitlement, aloofness, and – as with Clinton’s infamous “basket of deplorables” remark about Trump supporters – a history of insulting less educated people with conservative views. True, Clinton lacked the common touch, unlike her husband, former US President Bill Clinton. And Macron can come across as being contemptuous of anyone who stands in his way. But while personality counts in democratic politics, individual quirks do not explain everything. The visceral aversion to Clinton and Macron also reflects deeper social fissures resulting from shifts in party politics that began decades ago. Political parties used to be held together by class-based economic interests. The left, closely linked to trade unions, represented the interests of the industrial working class, and the right spoke for small and big business. Liberal democratic systems worked because these parties held each other in balance. It was clear what they stood for, and most voters felt that they had a stake in the fortunes of one side or the other. This began to change in the 1980s, when the left started drifting away from economic, class-based interests toward social and cultural issues such as anti-racism, gender and sexual emancipation, and multiculturalism. Trade unions were weakened, especially in the US and the United Kingdom, by deindustrialization, and their links with socialist and social-democratic parties began to fray. The left became more popular with educated and relatively well-off urban voters, many of whom disliked organized religion and opposed various kinds of social conservatism, such as racial prejudice. The big mistake these left-wing elites made was to assume that the working class, urban or rural, would naturally share their “progressive” social and cultural ideals. In fact, many people who would classify themselves as working class are conservative. Religion thrives among the poor. Immigrants are often perceived as a threat to their jobs. Gay rights do not rank high on their list of concerns. And this is not just true of white voters. In the US, many Latinos, and even Black people, now vote for the Republican Party. The left’s shift away from class-based politics began in the union-busting era of UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and US President Ronald Reagan, and became even more apparent after the collapse of communism in the Soviet bloc. In the West, the need to balance free-market economics with moderate redistribution was no longer regarded as an urgent priority. Even the UK’s formerly socialist Labour Party under Tony Blair, and the US Democratic Party under Bill Clinton, became keen promoters of the neoliberal policy agenda. Yet, if socially and culturally conservative rural voters and the urban working class felt increasingly alienated from center-left parties, they did not necessarily find the traditional pro-business center-right hospitable, either. For a long time, the so-called “country-club” Republican elite in the US would pay lip service to the conservative views of mostly white, blue-collar voters without college degrees by stirring up racial fears and promoting “Christian values.” But, once elected, these Republicans would turn their attention to business as usual. Many working-class voters thus felt betrayed by both the left, which they thought no longer represented their economic interests and despised their social attitudes, and the right, which took no notice of them once it was in power. Both Trump and Macron exploited this opening. Trump took over the Republican Party and turned it into a populist cult, while Macron blew up France’s center-left and center-right parties and replaced them with himself. Both men promised that they alone could fix their country’s problems, as though they were latter-day absolute monarchs. But Macron has a problem. Le Pen and Trump grew up in Paris and New York, respectively, with far greater wealth than Macron, but they share and understand the resentments of people who hate educated elites. Although Macron comes from France’s provincial middle class, he climbed his way into the upper class and assumed the superior attitudes of the old left-wing and right-wing political parties that he helped to destroy. That is why he must rely on the votes of older, highly educated people in big cities. The old French working class supports either the far-left leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon or Le Pen. Rural voters prefer Le Pen. And the young are on the far left or do not vote. We should feel relieved that enough French voters managed to stave off disaster. But Macron was right to temper any sense of triumph, and also to voice his obligation to those who dislike his policies but still voted for him. Many French voters feel abandoned, and Macron needs to take their interests seriously. After all, the liberal center cannot rely on urban elites alone. Let us hope that US Democrats are paying attention.",
            "为什么马克龙受人讨厌？ 纽约—法国不是美国。 包括我在内的许多自由主义者担心玛丽娜·勒庞(Marine Le Pen)可能会赢得法国总统职位，原因与特朗普在 2016 年击败希拉里·克林顿（Hillary Clinton）相同：对比较自由的候选人的厌恶将使极右翼的民粹主义者得逞。 幸运的是，有足够多的不喜欢总统马克龙的人在第二轮决选中捏着鼻子选了他，从而击败了勒庞。 如果必须在霍乱和鼠疫之间选，许多选民说，那么前者显然是更好的选择。 马克龙本人在他的胜选讲话中也承认了这一点，他说 ： “ 为所有投票给我的人，不是支持我的想法，而是为了阻止极右翼获胜，你们的投票让我获此重任 。 ” 但 41.5% 的选民选择了代表法国政治中极度反动、本土主义和非自由主义的候选人勒庞，这一事实仍然足以令人担忧。 那么，为什么这么多人讨厌马克龙？ 法国选民拒绝马克龙的原因与美国选民无法忍受希拉里·克林顿类似，是候选人的傲慢，权利，冷漠，以及 — — 就像克林顿论特朗普支持者的臭名昭着的“一篮子可悲之人”评论一样 — — 侮辱具有观点保守、受教育程度较低的人的历史。 诚然，与她的丈夫、美国前总统比尔·克林顿不同，希拉里不平易近人。 而马克龙给人以睥睨一切的感觉。 但是，虽然个性在民主政治中很重要，但个人怪癖并不能解释一切。 对克林顿和马克龙的本能厌恶也反映了几十年前开始的、政党政治转变所导致的更深层次的社会裂痕。 政党过去是由基于阶级的经济利益联合起来的。 左派与工会紧密联系，代表产业工人阶级的利益，右派则代表大小企业。 自由民主制度之所以奏效，是因为这些政党彼此制衡。 他们的立场很清楚，大多数选民认为他们与一方或另一方的命运息息相关。 这种情况在 1980 年代开始发生变化，当时左派开始从基于阶级的经济利益转向诸如反种族主义、性别和性解放以及多元文化主义等社会和文化问题。 去工业化削弱了工会，尤其是在美国和英国，工会与社会党和社会民主党的联系开始破裂。 左派在受过教育和相对富裕的城市选民中更受欢迎，其中许多人不喜欢有组织的宗教，也反对各种社会保守主义，例如种族偏见。 这些左翼精英犯的一个大错误是假设工人阶级，无论在城市还是农村，都天然共有他们的“进步”社会和文化理想。 事实上，许多将自己归类为工人阶级的人都是保守派。 宗教在穷人中间蓬勃发展。 移民常常被视为对工作的威胁。 同性恋权利在他们的关注清单上地位不高。 这不仅适用于白人选民。 在美国，许多拉丁裔，甚至是黑人，现在都投票给共和党。 左翼远离阶级政治的转变始于英国首相撒切尔和美国总统里根的工会破坏时代，在苏维埃阵营共产主义解体后更加明显。 在西方，平衡自由市场经济与适度​​再分配的需求不再被视为紧迫的优先事项。 就连布莱尔领导下的英国前社会派工党，和克林顿领导下的美国民主党，也成为新自由主义政策议程的热心推动者。 然而，即使社会和文化保守的农村选民和城市工人阶级感到日益远离中左翼政党，他们也未必认为传统的亲商业的中右翼更好。 长期以来，美国所谓的“乡村俱乐部”共和党精英会通过煽动种族恐惧和宣传“基督教价值观 ” ， 给予主要是没有大学学历的白人蓝领的选民保守主义口惠。 但是，一旦当选，这些共和党就会老方一贴 许多工人阶级选民因此感到被左派背叛，他们认为左派不再代表他们的经济利益，还鄙视他们的社会态度，而右派一旦掌权便不再关注他们。 特朗普和马克龙都利用了这个机会。 特朗普接管了共和党，把它变成了一个民粹主义的邪教，而马克龙则摧毁了法国的中左翼和中右翼政党，自己取而代之。 两人都承诺，他们可以独自解决国家的问题，就好像他们是近代的绝对君主一样。 但马克龙有一个问题。 勒庞和特朗普分别在巴黎和纽约长大，他们的财富远超马克龙，但他们共有和理解那些憎恨受过教育的精英的人的怨恨。 马克龙虽然出身于法国外省中产阶级，但他爬上了上层阶级，并承袭了他助力摧毁的旧左翼和右翼政党的优越态度。 这就是为什么他必须依靠大城市中受过高等教育的年长的人的选票。 老法国工人阶级要么支持极左翼领袖让-吕克·梅朗雄（Jean-Luc Mélenchon ） ， 要么支持勒庞。 农村选民更喜欢勒庞。 年轻人支持极左翼或不投票。 我们应该为足够多的法国选民成功抵挡了灾难而舒一口气。 但马克龙低调论胜，并表示负有不喜欢他的政策但仍选了他的任的重托，这是正确的。 许多法国选民感到被抛弃，马克龙需要认真对待他们的利益。 毕竟，自由中间派无法仅仅依靠城市精英。 单元美国民主党能引起注意。"

            "The Market’s Best of All Possible Worlds NEW YORK – Even though uncertainty about the outcome of the US presidential election is likely to drag on, the stock market has been rallying. Provided that the election is decided within weeks – rather than months – and that both candidates ultimately accept the outcome as legitimate, business sentiment and household optimism can be expected to remain robust. Indeed, the only surprise this week is how close the Electoral College contest turned out to be. The delay in counting the votes was to be expected, and market ebullience and positive economic sentiment are in keeping with previous trends. Insofar as the mainstream media’s pre-election forecasts were taken seriously, markets seem to have predicted – right up until November 3 – that Joe Biden would be a shoo-in, and that the Democrats would retake the Senate and maintain control of the House of Representatives. Had that happened, the Democrats might have interpreted their sweeping victory as a mandate for an activist progressive agenda. This likely would have included significant increases in public spending on goods and services (including health and education); business-unfriendly tax and regulatory reforms; more protectionist trade and foreign-investment policies; and far-reaching income redistribution (including boosts to Social Security and unemployment benefits). Markets would have perceived this agenda as bad for risk-asset valuations. But now that Republicans are on course to retain control of the Senate and made surprising gains in the House, there will be no mandate for a bold Democratic agenda. Any policies that are enacted at all will have to win at least some bipartisan support. Lawmakers will be reduced to bargaining over measures that have broad buy-in, such as business-friendly cyclical fiscal stimulus. Compared to the earlier expectations of a blue wave, markets view this scenario as grounds for celebration. To be sure, there has been a great deal of political messiness and dysfunction – including potential constitutional issues, baseless claims of election fraud, and a delay of several days or even weeks. But much of this was anticipated, given that the United States remains in the depths of a pandemic, and that US President Donald Trump has long signaled precisely how he would react to a close election. The media and election officials warned the electorate for months that there would be delays, and that the victor likely would not be known on Election Day. Demands for recounts were to be expected. This in itself is not worrisome; and recounts rarely change results. In this unconventional election, with its large volume of mail-in ballots and exceptional rancor, it is entirely normal for either or both sides to respond to a close outcome with questions of whether rules were broken. But, again, as long as the proper authorities resolve these disputes in the next few weeks, markets most likely will tolerate the uncertainty. On the other hand, if the final outcome is delayed to a degree that summons memories of the Bush vs. Gore dispute, which dragged on until December 12, 2000, market optimism and economic sentiment will probably start to suffer. There must be some inevitable point when the continued lack of resolution becomes a problem. Though it remains unlikely, the outright refusal by one of the candidates to accept the official outcome would have serious implications for markets and the US political system. Among other things, such a crisis would probably prevent the enactment of much-needed and overdue fiscal stimulus bills, leaving the US Federal Reserve, once again, as the only countercyclical game in town. In any case, the most likely electoral outcome would have a positive impact on markets, and a more or less neutral effect on the wider economy. Biden is not a self-proclaimed socialist like Bernie Sanders, and he is almost certain to face Republican resistance in the Senate. Moreover, six of the nine Supreme Court Justices are now staunch conservatives. It is hard to imagine a seriously business-unfriendly agenda being implemented under these conditions. At the same time, a meaningful countercyclical fiscal stimulus package will be a foregone conclusion. As far as the markets are concerned, what’s not to like?",
            "市场总归是利好 纽约—尽管美国总统竞选结果的不确定性可能还会延宕很久，但股市一直在上涨。 如果选举能够在几周而不是几个月内出结果，两位候选人都认可结果合法，那么可以预期商业情绪和家庭乐观程度将保持高涨。 事实上，本周唯一的意外是选举人团的争论的接近程度。 点票的延迟预计还会继续，市场兴奋和积极的经济情绪也与此前的趋势相符。 如果主流媒体的选举前预测被认真对待，那么市场的似乎预测了 — — 直到11月3日 — — 乔·拜登（Joe Biden）稳操胜券，民主党将重掌参议院并保持众议院的控制权。 果真如此的话，民主党可能将压倒性的大胜视为积极进步主义日程的授权。 这可能包括大大增加商品和服务的公共支出（包括健康和教育 ） ； 对企业不利的税收和监管改革；更为保护主义的贸易和外国投资政策；以及深入的收入再分配（包括提高社会保障和失业救济 ） 。 市场将认为这一日程对风险资产估值不利。 但如今，共和党眼看要重新控制参议院，并在众议院赢得意外的进展，民主党的激进日程也就不再具有合理性了。 任何最终得到实施的政策，都必须至少在某种程度上赢得两党支持。 立法者将会就有广泛基础的措施讨价还价，如对企业有利的周期性财政刺激。 与早前所预期的蓝色浪潮相反，市场认为这一情形可喜可贺。 诚然，存在大量政治混乱和瘫痪 — — 包括潜在的宪法问题，没有根据的选举欺诈指控，以及点票推迟几天甚至几周。 但大部分都在意料之中，因为美国仍处于深度疫情，美国总统特朗普也早已表现出他会如何应对接近的精选情况。 几个月来，媒体和选举官员警告选民可能出现计票推迟，选举日可能无法产生胜利者。 重新计票的要求也在意料之中。 这本身并不令人担忧，并且计票很少会改变结果。 这场不同寻常的大选中充斥着怨恨情绪以及大量邮寄选票，一方或双方对接近的结果产生破坏规则的质疑是完全正常的。 但是，只要相关部门能够在未来几周解决这些争端，市场可能会容忍这一不确定性。 另一方面，如果最终结果延迟到一定程度，让人想起布什对戈尔（Bush vs. Gore）的竞选争端（一直延续到2000年12月12日 ） ， 那么市场乐观程度和经济情绪有可能受到影响。 必然会有某个不可避免的时点，让迟迟无法产生的结果变成一个问题。 这一情形的可能性仍然很低，但其中一位候选人断然拒绝接受官方结果将给市场和美国政治制度造成严重影响。 这场危机有可能会阻碍急需且缺位已久的财政刺激法案的实施，美联储再一次不得不充当唯一的反周期战士。 无论如何，最有可能的选举结果将对市场有利，对整体经济的影响多少有限。 拜登不像伯尔尼·桑德斯(Bernie Sanders)那样是自称的社会主义者，他也几乎肯定会面临参议院共和党的抵制。 此外，九名最高法院大法官中有六人持保守立场。 很难想象严重不利于企业的日程会在这样的环境中实施。 与此同时，有意义的反周期财政刺激方案则是应有之义。 而市场会不喜欢吗？"

            "Why Marx Was Wrong STOCKHOLM – The bicentennial of Karl Marx’s birth has occasioned a surge of interest in the man’s work, complete with the unveiling of a statue in his hometown of Trier, Germany. At a celebration of Marxism in Beijing last week, Chinese President Xi Jinping declared that, “like a spectacular sunrise, the theory illuminated the path of humanity’s exploration of the law of history, and humanity’s search for [its] own liberation.” He would go on to claim that Marx “pointed out the direction, with scientific theory, toward an ideal society with no oppression or exploitation, where every person would enjoy equality and freedom.” Given that Xi’s words were uttered in “Marxist” China, those in attendance had no choice but to agree with them. Yet, speaking in Trier on the same day, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker offered a somewhat generous appraisal of his own: “Today he stands for things which is he not responsible for and which he didn’t cause, because many of the things he wrote down were redrafted into the opposite.” It is not entirely clear what Juncker meant by this. Marxism, after all, has inflicted untold misery on tens of millions of people who have been forced to live under regimes waving its banner. For much of the twentieth century, 40% of humanity suffered famines, gulags, censorship, and other forms of repression at the hands of self-proclaimed Marxists. In his speech, Juncker seemed to be alluding to the standard counterargument: that communist atrocities throughout the twentieth century were due to some sort of distortion of Marx’s thought, for which the man himself can scarcely be held responsible. Is there anything to this argument? Marx spent most of his life analyzing the political economy of the industrializing mid-nineteenth-century West. But his enduring relevance owes more to his ideas for the future, and the implications they would have for society. In considering his legacy, this area of his thought cannot be ignored. Marx regarded private property as the source of all evil in the emerging capitalist societies of his day. Accordingly, he believed that only by abolishing it could society’s class divisions be healed, and a harmonious future ensured. Under communism, his collaborator Friedrich Engels later claimed, the state itself would become unnecessary and “wither away.” These assertions were not made as speculation, but rather as scientific claims about what the future held in store. But, of course, it was all rubbish, and Marx’s theory of history – dialectical materialism – has since been proved wrong and dangerous in practically every respect. The great twentieth-century philosopher Karl Popper, one of Marx’s strongest critics, rightly called him a “false prophet.” And, if more evidence were needed, the countries that embraced capitalism in the twentieth century went on to become democratic, open, and prosperous societies. By contrast, every regime that has rejected capitalism in the name of Marxism has failed – and not by coincidence or as a result of some unfortunate doctrinal misunderstanding on the part of Marx’s followers. By abolishing private ownership and establishing state control of the economy, one not only deprives society of the entrepreneurship needed to propel it forward; one also abolishes freedom itself. Because Marxism treats all contradictions in society as the products of a class struggle that will disappear when private property does, dissent after the establishment of communism is impossible. By definition, any challenge to the new order must be an illegitimate remnant of the oppressive order that came before. Thus, Marxist regimes have in fact been logical extensions of his doctrines. Of course Juncker is right that Marx – who died 34 years before the Russian Revolution – was not responsible for the Gulag, and yet his ideas clearly were. In his landmark three-volume study Main Currents of Marxism, the Polish philosopher Leszek Kołakowski, who became a leading critic of Marxism after having embraced it in his youth, notes that Marx showed almost no interest in people as they actually exist. “Marxism takes little or no account of the fact that people are born and die, that they are men and women, young or old, healthy or sick,” he writes. As such, “Evil and suffering, in his eyes, had no meaning except as instruments of liberation; they were purely social facts, not an essential part of the human condition.” Kołakowski’s insight helps to explain why regimes that have embraced Marx’s mechanical and deterministic doctrine inevitably must turn to totalitarianism when confronting the reality of a complex society. They have not always fully succeeded; but the results have always been tragic. For his part, Xi views China’s economic development over the past few decades as “cast iron proof” of Marxism’s continued validity. But, if anything, it is exactly the other way around. Remember that it was the China of pure communism that produced the famine and terror of the “Great Leap Forward” and the “Cultural Revolution.” Mao’s decision to deprive farmers of their land and entrepreneurs of their firms had predictably disastrous results, and the Communist Party of China has since abandoned that doctrinaire approach. Under Mao’s successor, Deng Xiaoping, the CPC launched China’s great economic “opening-up.” After 1978, it began to restore private ownership and permit entrepreneurship, and the results have been nothing short of spectacular. If China’s development is being held back by anything today, it is the remnants of Marxism that are still visible in inefficient state-owned enterprises and the repression of dissent. China’s centralized single-party system is simply incompatible with a modern and diverse society. Two hundred years after Marx’s birth, it is certainly wise to reflect on his intellectual legacy. We should do so not in celebration, however, but to inoculate our open societies against the totalitarian temptation that lurks in his false theories.",
            "为什么马克思是错误的 斯德哥尔摩—卡尔·马克思诞辰两百周年引起对他的著作的兴趣大涨，他的家乡德国特里尔（Trier）揭幕了马克思雕像。 上周在北京举行的马克思主义纪念大会中，中国国家主席习近平强调 ， “ 。 这一理论犹如壮丽的日出，照亮了人类探索历史规律和寻求自身解放的道路 。 ” 接着他又说，马克思“以科学的理论为最终建立一个没有压迫、没有剥削、人人平等、人人自由的理想社会指明了方向 。 ” 习近平的这番话是在“马克思主义”中国说出的，在场各位别无选择，只有同意。 但是，在同一天的特里尔，欧盟委员会主席容克也不吝慷慨平价 ： “ 今天，他代表了他不必负责也非他引起的东西，因为他所写下的很多东西遭到了意义完全相反的改写 。 ” 容克的这番话到底是什么意思并不完全清楚。 毕竟，马克思主义给数千万被迫生活在高举它的大旗的体制中的人带来了不可名状的悲惨。 在二十世纪的大部分时间里，40%的人类在自称的马克思主义者手中，经受着饥荒、集中营、审查和其他形式的压迫。 在他的讲话中，容克似乎暗示标准的反驳：贯穿二十世纪的共产主义暴行是因为对马克思思想的某种扭曲导致的，而马克思本人不必为此负责。 这一观点有道理吗？ 马克思大半辈子都在分析工业化的十九世纪中期西方的政治经济学。 但他的持续重要性更多来自他关于未来的思想，以及这些思想给社会造成的影响。 在思考他的遗产时，他的思想的这一领域不能忽视。 马克思认为，私有财产是他的时代的新兴资本主义社会的万恶之源。 据此，他相信只有消灭私有财产，社会阶级分化问题才能解决，和谐的未来才有保障。 他的合作者恩格斯后来宣称，在共产主义下，国家本身将变得没有必要并将“幻灭 ” 。 这些主张不是作为预测提出，而是作为对未来的科学论断提出。 但是，所有这些当然都是垃圾，马克思的历史理论 — — 辩证唯物主义无论从什么角度看，都是错误和危险的。 二十世纪著名哲学家、马克思主义最强烈的批评者之一卡尔·波普尔（Karl Popper）正确地称马克思为“假先知 ” 。 如果说还需要更多证据的话，看看二十世纪接受了资本主义的国家，纷纷成为民主、开放、繁荣的社会。 相反，所有以马克思主义的名义拒绝资本主义的体制，都遭到了失败 — — 这不是巧合，也不是因为马克思的信徒不幸地错误理解了马克思的思想。 消灭私有产权、建立国家对经济的控制不但让社会失去了推动国家前进的企业家精神，也消灭了自由本身。 马克思将一切社会矛盾都处理为阶级斗争，而阶级斗争会随着私有财产的消失而消失，因此，共产主义成立后不可能再有异见。 顾名思义，任何对新秩序的挑战必然此前压迫性秩序的非法残余。 因此，马克思主义体制实际上是他的学说的逻辑延伸。 当然，容克说马克思 — — 他逝世于俄国大革命34年前 — — 不必为古拉格负责是正确的，但他的思想显然需要负责。 在其标志性的三卷本研究《马克思主义的主流 》 （ Main Currents of Marxism）中，波兰哲学家、青年时代接受马克思主义但后来成为马克思主义的主要批评者的莱斯泽克·科拉科夫斯基（Leszek Kołakowski）指出，马克思几乎对作为实际存在的人的毫无兴趣。 “马克思主义基本没有考虑一个事实，即人有出生和死亡，有男女，有老少，有病健 。 ” 他写道。 同样地 ， “ 邪恶和苦难在他眼中除了成为解放的工具之外毫无意义；它们是纯粹的社会事实，而不是人的条件的不可或缺的一部分 。 ” 科拉科夫斯基的洞见有助于解释，接受了马克思的机械和决定论的体制，在面临复杂社会的现实时，都不可避免地必须变成极权主义。 它们不总能完全成功；但结果总是悲剧。 至于习近平，他认为中国在过去的经济发展是马克思主义持续的活力的“铁证 ” 。 但如果说它们证明了什么的话，内容正好相反。 不要忘了，纯粹共产主义的中国产生了“大跃进”和“文化大革命”的饥荒和恐怖。 毛泽东没收农民土地和企业家企业的决定带来了可以预见的灾难性结果，而中国共产党后来也抛弃了这一教条主义方针。 在毛泽东的继任者邓小平的领导下，中共开启了中国伟大的经济“开放 ” 。 1978年后，中国开始恢复私人所有权，允许企业家精神，结果可谓壮观。 要论中国的发展今天被什么东西所拖累，那就是可以从无效的国有企业和对异见的压迫中管窥的马克思主义残余。 中国的中央集权一党制与现代的多元化社会完全不相容。 马克思诞生已经过去了两百年，思考他的思想遗产毫无疑问是明智的。 但我们不应该庆祝，而应该让我们的开放社会免疫于潜伏在他的错误理论中的极权主义诱惑。"

            "Why Mexico is Sick Mexico City – As I reflect on my troubled country, the lyrics of a Bruce Springsteen song come to mind: “We are far, far away from home. Our home is far, far away from us.” That’s how it feels to live in Mexico nowadays: far from democratic normalcy; far from a health system that inspires confidence; far from a government that builds trust; far from home and close to everything that imperils it. My homeland has become a place where too many people are victims, succumbing to a virus, or gunned down by a drug-trafficker; assaulted by a robber, shot by an ill-trained policeman, or kidnapped by a member of a criminal gang. The flu epidemic, which probably began in the southern state of Veracruz, is yet another sign that all is not well in Mexico. The country seems to be caught in a permanent, uneasy tug-of-war between the past and the future, between change and the actors who seek to place obstacles in its path. For example, when initial reports surfaced about the first swine flu cases, it took three weeks for the information to reach federal health authorities, because state governments were reluctant to report cases quickly due to political and electoral considerations. Mexico faces mid-term elections for Congress in the fall, and President Felipe Calderón’s National Action Party is trailing slightly in the polls over its main rivals, who would like nothing better than to see a health emergency translate into a political defeat. In the face of a public health system that seemed incapable of diagnosing and treating the outbreak quickly, the government felt it had little choice but to shut down Mexico City, dealing a severe blow to an already crippled economy. In contrast with Mexico’s authoritarian past, when an “imperial presidency” constituted a major obstacle to modernization, power has been dispersed. What the executive branch has relinquished, or been forced to give up, vested interests have seized. The problem is no longer too much power in the president’s hands, but too much power in the hands of “veto centers” – including public-sector unions – that are blocking much-needed reforms, including in the health system. In all likelihood, the 22 reported dead from swine flu reflect a social safety net falling to pieces due to lack of public investment and union recalcitrance. The flu also revealed some of Mexico’s other fundamental flaws. The political system has become a peculiar hybrid of authoritarian remnants and newly established mechanisms for transparency. The electoral process has been unable to guarantee decent democratic governance, rein in predatory practices among the political class, or make public officials follow established rules, keep them responsive to citizen preferences, and deter them from channeling public funds into private hands. Lack of accountability has both encouraged corruption and fed perceptions that abuse remains unpunished. Impunity, in turn, erodes the credibility of the country’s institutions, including public hospitals and clinics. Today, conspiracy theories abound in Mexico about the origins of the virus, because government officials are viewed with such ingrained suspicion. Throughout the epidemic, citizens have largely obeyed government guidelines and followed public health prescriptions. But that doesn’t mean they trust the government. Public-opinion polls reveal that more than 50% of the population believe that political parties are “not necessary” for the good of the country. Disapproval of Congress is growing, and people’s satisfaction with representative democracy has decreased. In the midst of the epidemic, 66% of Mexicans believe that the country is regressing. Seventy-five percent of crimes are not reported due to lack of trust in the authorities, and 98% of crimes are never resolved or punished. Public opinion seems disenchanted with a democracy incapable of offering tangible solutions to problems, the flu crisis being the most recent example. Saddled by a viral infection, drug-related insecurity, and rising crime, Mexico feels like a besieged place. The noted columnist Miguel Angel Granados Chapa wrote last week: “All that’s missing is for Mexico to get peed on by a dog.” Mexico’s bad health is a symptom of problems that run deeper and are more widespread than swine flu. Over the past ten years, political and economic actors intent on preserving the status quo have blocked further democratic change and economic reform, condemning Mexico to move sideways, even as other emerging markets surge ahead. Lately, political battles among key actors have not been about how to build a more effective of representative political system or a more equitable, dynamic economy, but about how to maintain control of accumulated power or distribute it among their allies. Political parties appear far removed from citizen demands, beset by internal divisions, incapable of addressing deep-rooted inequality and lawlessness, and prone to populist or authoritarian leadership that promises quick fixes to entrenched problems. Mexico’s current quandary is the flu, but it faces more important challenges than a mutating microbe. With more than 40 million people living in poverty and 7,000 killed in drug-related violence last year, Mexico will need to reform quickly to address what the virus has brought to light: a government far removed from the suffering of ordinary people and too frequently insensitive to their plight. In this national crisis, Mexico’s people have closed ranks, collaborated, and showed that they are capable of working together to achieve common goals in the public interest. But their political and economic elites frequently seem incapable of doing so. That is why home seems far, far away for so many Mexicans.",
            "墨西哥病在何处 墨西哥城 — — 故乡墨西哥层出不穷的问题让我不禁想起布鲁斯·斯普林斯汀的一句歌词 — — “我们离家乡很远很远；家乡在那很远很远的远方 。 ” 这句歌词正是今天墨西哥人的真实感受：正常的民主、可靠的医疗卫生体系、可信的政府都已远去，不见了家乡，只剩下危机重重。 今天的墨西哥，病毒肆虐、毒贩猖獗、盗贼横行，再加上警察训练无素，有太多人为此丢了性命，太多人被犯罪团伙所挟持绑架。 这场可能源自南部韦拉克鲁斯州的猪流感疫情则给墨西哥目前一团糟的局面雪上加霜。 墨西哥似乎陷入了一场过去与未来、变革与阻碍之间的、永久的、令人不安的拉锯战中。 从这场猪流感疫情暴发来看，各州政府出于政治选举考虑，不愿尽快向上报告疫情，因此直到第一批猪流感病例出现三周以后，墨西哥联邦医疗卫生部门才得到消息。 今年秋天，墨西哥国会将迎来中期选举，总统费利佩·卡尔德龙所在的国家行动党在民意调查中目前略微落后于主要竞争对手。 这些竞选对手最希望看到的莫过于国家行动党在医疗卫生事件上政治行动的失败。 疫情暴发后，墨西哥的公共医疗卫生体系似乎无力迅速诊治患者、控制疫情，政府不得不下令“关闭”墨西哥城，给原本已举步维艰的经济带来重创。 与过去阻碍现代化进程的“帝王总统”式独裁统治不同，如今墨西哥权力已不再集中。 行政部门放弃或被迫放弃的一部分权力如今已被各既得利益集团所掌控。 现在权利过大的不是总统，而是包括公共部门工会在内的各 “否决中心 ” ， 正是它们阻挠了医疗卫生体制改革等一系列亟需推进的改革。 由于公共投入不足和工会的反对阻挠，墨西哥的社会安全网已千疮百孔，这次疫情中22人死亡就是明证。 这场猪流感疫情同样也暴露出墨西哥其他根本性缺陷。 其特有的政治体制中既含有独裁主义的残余也包括新建立起来的透明机制。 现行选举程序下，正当的民主治理得不到保证，政治阶级的掠夺行为屡禁不止，政府官员有章不循、中饱私囊、对民众诉求无动于衷。 问责制度的缺失滋生了腐败，滥用职权好像总能逃脱惩罚，这反过来又损害了公立医院、诊所等国家机构的公信力。 关于疫情病毒的起源，目前在墨西哥有很多传言，民众莫衷一是，因为他们对政府官员早已不再信任。 猪流感疫情暴发后，墨西哥民众虽然基本上遵照了政府的指示 和公共医疗卫生指南，但这并不意味着他们信任政府。 民意调查表明，超过50%的人认为政党间的竞争并不符合国家利益。 民众对国会的支持率越来越低，对代议民主制度的满意程度也出现了下降。 疫情暴发后，多达66%的墨西哥人认为墨西哥正在退步。 由于民众对当局缺乏信心， 75% 的犯罪案件没有上报；98%的犯罪案件无果而终，犯罪分子仍逍遥法外。 民众对于现行民主政体似乎已不抱希望，不指望看到切实的解决方案，而这场猪流感疫情危机则再次证明了这一点。 病毒的蔓延、毒品的泛滥、社会的动荡、不断上升的犯罪率，墨西哥似乎已四面楚歌、走投无路。 著名专栏作家Miguel Angel Granados Chapa上周就曾写道 ： “ 现在墨西哥就差受狗的胯下之辱了 。 ” 墨西哥生病了，其症状的根源比猪流感疫情来得更深更广。 过去十年中，政界和商界人士为维持现状，阻挠民主和经济的进一步改革，使墨西哥的发展偏离了方向。 而与此同时，其他新兴市场则纷纷崛起。 最近，墨西哥政坛激烈争论的焦点并不是如何建立更有效、更具代表性的政治体系，或更公平、更具活力的经济体系，而是如何继续掌控手中的权利，如何与同盟分配这些权利。 各政党忙于处理内部纠纷，无力实现公平、法治，指望善作承诺的民粹主义或独裁主义领导者瞬间把根深蒂固的问题消弭于无形。 对于民众的诉求，它们早已无暇顾及。 墨西哥当前面临的难题是控制猪流感疫情��但这远远不是其挑战的全部。 墨西哥仍有4000万贫困人口，仅去年一年就有7000余人死于毒品相关的暴力事件。 墨西哥需要迅速推进改革，以解决由猪流感疫情所暴露出的根源性问题 — — 即政府对普通民众的疾苦不闻不问、无动于衷。 面对这场全国性的危机，墨西哥人民齐心协力、共克时艰，展现出为公共利益团结奋斗的能力。 然而，墨西哥政界和商界的精英们似乎常常无法做到这一点。 因此，许多墨西哥人才会觉得家乡还在那很远很远的远方。"

            "Why Morals Matter in Foreign Policy CAMBRIDGE – When I told a friend I had just written a book on morality and foreign policy, she quipped: “It must be a very short book.” Such skepticism is common. An Internet search shows surprisingly few books on how US presidents’ moral views affected their foreign policies. As the eminent political theorist Michael Walzer once described American graduate training in international relations after 1945, “Moral argument was against the rules of the discipline as it was commonly practiced.” The reasons for skepticism seem obvious. While historians have written about American exceptionalism and moralism, realist diplomats like George F. Kennan – the father of the US “containment” doctrine in the Cold War – long warned about the downside of the American moralist-legalist tradition. International relations is an anarchic realm; no world government exists to provide order. States must provide for their own defense, and when survival is at stake, the ends justify the means. Where there is no meaningful choice, there can be no ethics. As philosophers say, “ought implies can.” No one can fault you for not doing the impossible. By this logic, combining ethics and foreign policy is a category mistake, like asking if a knife sounds good rather than if it cuts well, or whether a broom dances better than one that costs more. So, in judging a president’s foreign policy, we should simply ask whether it worked, not whether it was moral. While this view has some merit, it ducks hard questions by oversimplifying. The absence of a world government does not mean the absence of all international order. Some foreign policy issues relate to a nation-state’s survival, but most do not. Since World War II, the United States, for example, has been involved in several wars, but none were necessary for its survival. And many important foreign policy choices about human rights, climate change, or Internet freedom do not involve war at all. Indeed, most foreign policy issues involve trade-offs among values that require choices, not application of a rigid formula of raison d’état. A cynical French official once told me, “I define good as what is good for the interests of France. Morals are irrelevant.” He seemed unaware that his statement itself was a moral judgment. It is tautological or at best trivial to say that all states try to act in their national interest. The important question is how leaders choose to define and pursue that national interest under different circumstances. Moreover, whether we like it or not, Americans constantly make moral judgments about presidents and foreign policy. Even before his famous phone call asking the president of Ukraine for a favor, the behavior of Donald Trump’s administration had raised the issue of morality and foreign policy from a theoretical question to front-page news. For example, after the 2018 killing of Saudi dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi in his country’s consulate in Istanbul, Trump was criticized for ignoring clear evidence of a brutal crime in order to maintain good relations with the Saudi Crown Prince. The liberal New York Times labeled Trump’s statement about Khashoggi “remorselessly transactional, heedless of the facts,” while the conservative Wall Street Journal editorialized that “we are aware of no President, not even such ruthless pragmatists as Richard Nixon or Lyndon Johnson, who would have written a public statement like this without so much as a grace note about America’s abiding values and principles.” Oil, arms sales, and regional stability are national interests, but so are values and principles that are attractive to others. How can they be combined? Unfortunately, many judgments about ethics and contemporary US foreign policy are haphazard or poorly thought through, and too much of the current debate focuses on Trump’s personality. My new book Do Morals Matter? attempts to correct this by showing that some of Trump’s actions are not unprecedented for US presidents since WWII. As a perceptive reporter once remarked to me, “Trump is not unique; he is extreme.” Even more important, Americans are seldom clear about the criteria by which we judge a foreign policy. We praise a president like Ronald Reagan for the moral clarity of his statements, as though good intentions well expressed were sufficient in making ethical judgments. But Woodrow Wilson and George W. Bush showed that good intentions without adequate means to achieve them can lead to ethically bad outcomes, such as the Treaty of Versailles after WWI or Bush’s invasion of Iraq. Or we judge a president simply on results. Some observers credit Richard Nixon for ending the Vietnam War, but he sacrificed 21,000 American lives to create a face-saving “decent interval” that turned out to be an ephemeral pause on the road to defeat. Good moral reasoning should be three-dimensional, weighing and balancing intentions, consequences, and means. A foreign policy should be judged accordingly. Moreover, a moral foreign policy must consider consequences such as maintaining an institutional order that encourages moral interests, in addition to particular newsworthy actions such as helping a dissident or a persecuted group in another country. And it is important to include the ethical consequences of “nonactions,” such as President Harry S. Truman’s willingness to accept stalemate and domestic political punishment during the Korean War rather than follow General Douglas MacArthur’s recommendation to use nuclear weapons. As Sherlock Holmes famously noted, much can be learned from a dog that does not bark. It is pointless to argue that ethics will play no role in the foreign policy debates that await this year. We should acknowledge that we always use moral reasoning to judge foreign policy, and we should learn to do it better.",
            "道德在外交政策中的重要性 坎布里奇—我告诉一位朋友，我刚刚写了一本关于道德和外交政策的书，她打趣说 ： “ 那肯定很薄 。 ” 这种怀疑很正常。 一项互联网研究表明，关于美国总统的道德观如何影响他们的外交政策的书籍少得令人吃惊。 著名政治理论家迈克尔·沃尔泽（Michael Walzer）曾描述过 美国研究生在1945年后国际关系方面的训练 ： “ 道德观点与通行学科法则相悖 。 ” 怀疑的理由显而易见。 历史学家大谈美国例外论和道德论，而现实主义外交家，如乔治·凯南（George F. Kennan，冷战时期美国“遏制”思维之父）一直警告美国以德治国（moralist-legalist）传统的危险。 国际关系是无政府主义王国；不存在提供秩序的世界政府。 国家必须为自己提供防务，当面对生存危机问题时，可以不择手段。 有有意义的选择，就没有伦理。 哲学家说 ， “ 应该即能够 。 ” 没人能够因为你没有完成不可能之事而怪罪你。 根据这一逻辑，将伦理与外交政策相提并论是一个分类错误，就像是在问刀声音怎么样，而不是切起来怎么样，或者扫帚甲舞跳得是否比更贵的扫帚乙更好。 因此，在评判总统的外交政策时，我们只需要问它是否有效，而不是它是否道德。 这一观点不无道理，但过于简化，规避了困难的问题。 世界政府的缺失并不意味着所有一切国际秩序缺位。 一些外交政策问题与民族国家的存亡相关，但大部分并非如此。 比如，二战后，美国卷入了多场战争，但没有一场威胁到它的生存。 许多关于人权、气候变化和互联网自由的重要外交政策选择也与战争完全无关。 事实上，大部分外交政策问题都包含着需要从中做出选择的不同价值观之间的权衡，而不是生搬硬套生存状态公式。 一位犬儒主义法国官员曾经对我说 ， “ 我将好定义为对法国利益好。 道德无关紧要 。 ” 他似乎没有认识到，他这番话本身便是一个道德判断。 说所有国家都试图按照国家利益行动，这是同义反复，或毫无意义。 重要的问题是领导人如何在不同环境下定义和追求这一国家利益。 此外，不管我们喜不喜欢，美国人一直在对总统和外交政策作道德评判。 在特朗普打那通著名的电话之前 — — 要求乌克兰总统帮个忙 — — 其政府的行为已经将道德和外交政策问题从一个理论问题变成了热议话题。 比如，2018年沙特异见记者贾马尔·卡舒吉（Jamal Khashoggi）在沙特驻伊斯坦布尔领事馆被杀后，特朗普被批忽视显而易见的残忍犯罪证据，以维持与沙特王储的良好关系。 自由派的《纽约时报》给特朗普关于卡舒吉的评论贴上了“冷酷的场面话，根本不关心事实 ， ” 而保守的《华尔街日报》发表社论说“我们知道，没有哪位总统，哪怕是像尼克松和约翰逊这样的冷酷无情的务实主义者，会写这样一份公开声明无视美国始终坚持不辍的价值观与原则 。 ” 石油、军售和地区稳定是国家利益，吸引其他国家的人的价值观和原则亦然。 它们如何结合？ 不幸的是，许多关于伦理和当代美国外交政策的评判颇为随意，没有经过深思熟虑，而当前争论又过多地集中在特朗普的个性上。 我的新书《道德重要吗？ 》 （ Do Morals Matter ? ） 试图纠正这一点，指出特朗普的一些行为在二战后的美国总统中没有先例。 一位敏锐的记者曾经向我评论说 ： “ 特朗普不是独特，他是极端 。 ” 更重要的是，美国人很少弄得清他们用什么标准评判外交政策。 我们赞美里根等总统的声明道德明晰，好像良好意愿被良好表达就足以让人做出伦理评判似的。 但威尔逊和小布什证明，良好意愿如果没有足够的手段实现，可能带来糟糕的伦理结果，如一战结束后的凡尔赛和约和小布什入侵伊拉克。 或者，我们完全根据结果来评判总统。 一些观察者将结束越南战争的功劳记在了尼克松头上，但他牺牲了21000名美国人的生命炮制了挽回颜面的“体面间隔 ” ， 最终证明这只是通往战败之路上的短暂休止。 好的道德理性应该有三个维度，权衡且平衡的意图、后果，以及手段。 外交政策应该据此进行评判。 此外，道德的外交政策必须考某些后果，比如维持鼓励道德利益（moral interests）的制度秩序，还要有特别有新闻价值的行为，比如帮助他国的异见分子或受迫害群体。 将“不作为”的伦理后果也很重要，比如在朝鲜战争期间，杜鲁门愿意接受僵局和国内政治惩罚，而没有遵循麦克阿瑟上将的建议使用核武器。 福尔摩斯有一句名言，你可以从不吠的狗身上学到很多。 认为伦理在今年的外交政策争论中毫无作用完全不得要领。 我们应该承认，我们总是用道德理性来评判外交政策，并且我们应该学习更好地这样做。"

            "What Divides NATO? BERLIN – When US President Donald Trump arrives in Poland on August 31, he is certain to receive a rapturous welcome from the country’s government. And, having recently proclaimed himself the new Messiah for the people of Israel, Trump may interpret the applause in Warsaw to mean that he is the king of Poland, too. But, besides playing to Trump’s vanity, the Polish government will be sure to make the US military presence in the country a prime topic for discussion. These days, the debate about US troops in Poland is sometimes seen as pitting that country against Germany. But this misses the point. What is really at stake is European coherence in the face of America’s increasingly uncertain role within NATO. True, recent remarks by Trump and other high-ranking American officials, such as Richard Grenell and Georgette Mosbacher, the US ambassadors to Germany and Poland respectively, have fueled the perception that the US is contrasting Germany unfavorably with Poland. While criticizing Germany for its lackluster defense spending, the US administration seems keen to reward Poland for spending 2% of its GDP on defense – a target that all NATO members have pledged to meet (although few are currently doing so). And the Polish government’s own recent criticisms of German defense spending have reinforced this impression. Yet talk of a Polish-German spat over defense is exaggerated. Although the US has announced plans to station another 1,000 troops in Poland, in addition to the 4,500 it already has there, it is not clear whether the extra forces would be drawn from those currently stationed in Germany, or from the US. And even if the additional troops did come from Germany, this would hardly represent a major US strategic shift. Moreover, the Polish government itself has repeatedly stated that it doesn’t regard the American military presence in the country as a zero-sum-issue vis-à-vis Germany or other European NATO allies. At the same time, however, there is a deeper, more worrying reason why the issue of US troops in Poland has received so much political attention. Trump’s ambivalent – and often openly hostile – remarks about NATO have raised doubts about the credibility of US security commitments in Europe. And that uncertainty in turn has deepened political frictions inside the European Union and among European NATO allies. Although these splits do not run neatly between Western and Eastern Europe, they do reflect two main regional differences. The first divide is between countries that have a relatively relaxed view of the security challenge posed by Russia and those that see it as a major and immediate threat to their wellbeing. Ever since Germany shed the frontline status it had during the Cold War confrontation between East and West, it has regarded NATO primarily as a political tool rather than as an instrument for effective defense and out-of-area interventions. As such, German policymakers can afford to have a rather abstract view of US credibility that is mostly based on Trump’s statements and tweets. Indeed, there is much talk in Berlin these days about increasing “European strategic autonomy” vis-à-vis the US. But today’s frontline states, including Poland, the Baltic countries, and Romania, do not have the luxury of thinking that way. Out of necessity, they measure American credibility first and foremost by what the Trump administration and the US military are doing on the ground. For these governments, the fact that the US is deploying troops and participating in military exercises in the region is much more relevant than Trump’s anti-NATO tweets. European NATO allies also are divided regarding the role of nuclear weapons. Germany has hardly any interest in such issues, and even in Eastern European NATO member states, officials and academics seem to have little detailed knowledge about nuclear-weapons policy. The Baltic countries, for example, instead emphasize defense against hybrid or non-nuclear threats. As a high-ranking Latvian foreign-policy official confided to me recently, if nuclear deterrence were NATO’s highest priority, his country could be occupied militarily long before preventing a nuclear escalation by Russia became relevant. Instead, Eastern European NATO members see the presence of US nuclear weapons in Europe in political-strategic terms. What matters to them are not details about the weapons’ explosive yield, delivery systems, or locations, but simply the fact that they are there. For East Europeans, these arms underpin America’s political commitment to the continent’s security. Calls from German politicians, especially on the left, to remove these weapons are therefore likely to be greeted with hostility in Poland and Germany’s other eastern neighbors. As Trump turns up the heat on burden-sharing and continues his attacks on NATO and individual allies, European divisions are likely to deepen. Europe’s governments must manage these conflicts while striving to make the continent more self-sufficient in security and defense. The really important question is whether and how they do this – and not whether a few hundred troops might be moved from Germany to Poland.",
            "什么撕裂了北约？ 柏林—8月31日，当美国总统特朗普到达波兰时，他肯定会受到波兰政府极其热烈的欢迎。 最近，特朗普宣布自己时以色列民族的新救世主，他可能会把在华沙受到的溢美之词解读为他同时也是波兰之王。 但是，除了恭维特朗普的虚荣心，波兰政府肯定还会将美国驻军波兰作为主要讨论话题。 如今，关于美国驻军波兰的争论有时候被视为是波兰和德国争美国。 但这没有切中要害。 真正重要的是，在美国在北约的作用日益存疑的请款下，欧洲要保持团结。 诚然，特朗普和其他美国高级官员，如分别担任美国驻德国和波兰大使的理查德·格伦奈尔（Richard Grenell）和乔吉特·莫斯巴彻（Georgette Mosbacher ） ， 他们的最新评论让人们感到美国更偏向于波兰。 美国政府批评德国防务开支不力，摆出一副很想奖励波兰防务支出达到GDP的2%的样子 — — 这也是所有北约成员国都承诺要满足的水平（但真正兑现的很少 ） 。 波兰政府最近对德国防务支出的批评更是加强了这一印象。 但炒作波兰-德国防务口水战有过度之嫌。 尽管美国已经宣布计划在已有的4 500名驻军的基础上，再向波兰增兵1 000人，但这些新驻军将从驻德美军中抽调还是从美国派遣尚不清楚。 即使所增兵力真的来自德国，也并不代表美国的战略发生了重大转变。 此外，波兰政府本身也反复生声明，它并不认为驻波兰美军是与德国或其他欧洲北约盟友的零和博弈。 但与此同时，对于波兰的美国驻军问题吸引了如此多的政治关注，还有更深刻、更令人担心的原因。 特朗普对北约的自相矛盾 — — 常常公开对立 — — 的言论让人质疑美国对欧洲安全承诺的信誉。 而这一不确定性反过来深化了欧盟内部以及欧洲的北约盟国之间的政治摩擦。 尽管这一分歧并非明确沿着西欧和东欧分野展开，但也确实反映了两大主要的地区差异。 第一个差异存在于对俄罗斯所带来的安全挑战持相对放松的观点的国家与视之为国家福祉的迫在眉睫的重大威胁的国家之间。 自从德国摆脱冷战期间东西方对峙前沿的地位，它便将北约视为政治工具，而非有效的防务和地区外干预的工具。 因此，德国决策者可以对美国的信誉采取相当抽象的看法，主要基于特朗普的言论和推特。 事实上，最近柏林有很多人在谈论增加面对美国的“欧洲战略自主 ” 。 但今天的前沿国家，包括波兰、波罗的海国家和罗马尼亚，没有这样想的奢侈。 出于必要性，它们衡量美国信誉首先也主要是根据特朗普政府和美军做了些什么。 对这些国家的政府而言，美国在本地区部署军队、参加军事演习这一事实，要远比特朗普的反北约推特重要得多。 北约的欧洲盟国的另一个分歧点时核武器的角色。 德国对这类问题毫无兴趣，即使是北约的东欧成员国，官员和学者也对核武器政策没有多少详细的了解。 比如，波罗的海国家反而强调针对混合和非核武器的威胁。 一位立陶宛外交政策高官最近向我透露，如果核威慑是北约的最高重点工作，那么他的国家早就被军事占领了，以防俄罗斯核扩张。 相反，北约的东欧成员国用政治-战略角度看待美国在欧洲部署核武器。 对它们来说，重要的不是核武器爆炸当量、发射系统或部署位置的细节，而是核武器就在那里这一事实。 对东欧人来说，这些武器才是美国对欧洲政治承诺的基石。 因此，来自德国政客，特别是左翼政客的移除这些武器呼声，可能会在波兰以及德国的其他东部邻国遭到敌意。 特朗普大放负担共担之厥词，不断地攻击北约和个别盟国，欧洲的分裂可能还会深化。 欧洲政府必须遏制这些冲突，同时致力于让欧洲在安全与防务问题上更加自给自足。 真正重要的问题是他们会不会这样做，如何这样做 — — 而不是是否会有几百人的队伍从德国调拨到波兰。"

            "My Worst Forecasting Mistake NEW HAVEN – I have been in the economic forecasting business for close to 50 years. I got my start in the early 1970s, on the research staff at the Federal Reserve in Washington, DC, before taking my crystal ball to Wall Street for over 30 years. For more than a decade, it has been the ivory tower at Yale – still dabbling in forecasting from time to time but mainly teaching, writing, and speaking. Over that long stretch, my forecasting record has been mixed. There were a couple of memorable calls at the Fed, where I warned of a sharp recession in the mid-1970s and intractable inflation later in the decade. But I look back with the greatest pride on my collaboration with Larry Slifman in building the Fed’s first “black box” forecasting model that I believe is still largely in use today. We worked around the clock for several weeks to program linked computer-based spreadsheets (unheard of back then) as a replacement for the single-iteration monthly exercise previously done manually on a Monroe calculator. Our so-called judgmental approach was the point-counterpoint to the Fed’s renowned large-scale econometric model. My Wall Street efforts were more thematic. I continued to forecast but focused more on big-picture developments such as corporate debt and restructuring in the late 1980s, the productivity debate of the 1990s, global healing of a post-crisis world in the early 2000s, and then my sweet spot, China and its impact on the global economy. My Wall Street forecasting record was good enough to maintain job security at Morgan Stanley, although there were several close calls. Attempting to predict interest rates was my least favorite part of the job. With good reason. I remember walking into the old Morgan Stanley investment banking meeting room and seeing a chart of my predecessor’s bond market forecast sitting upside down on the floor. I was determined to avoid that fate. When my favorite bond trader started calling me “dart man,” I made an executive decision to disengage and hire an interest-rate strategist. Survival of the fittest, I guess. I should have known better when I came off the bench as a retired forecaster last summer and penned a piece with the now memorable title of “America’s Coming Double Dip.” I argued that the post-pandemic rebound – a record 33% annualized pop in GDP in the third quarter of 2020 following an equally sharp 31% contraction in the second period – was nothing more than an arithmetic yo-yo. But that brilliant insight wasn’t really the point. I went on to stress that the nascent recovery was likely to be aborted by a relapse, as had occurred in eight of the preceding 11 recessions since the end of World War II. A few months later, taking comfort from some economic indicators that had broken my way, I committed the most egregious forecasting sin of all: giving a date. I actually wrote that the coming double-dip was likely to occur by mid-2021. The worst forecasting mistake of my career? It sure seems that way. Rather than the relapse that I was looking for, there is now widespread talk of an open-ended boom. My well-trained successor team at Morgan Stanley, which has been aggressive and right with their forecast of a V-shaped snapback from the COVID-19 shock, is now calling for a nearly 10% annualized increase in US economic growth in the first half of 2021. That’s not exactly the dip that I, their former team leader, was expecting. Had I still been in that chair, the cold sweats of my job-security nightmares undoubtedly would have returned. Wall Street forecasters quickly learn the rules of culpability. Like bond and stock traders, the “mark-to-market” mindset forces intellectual accountability on economists and, sometimes, even on market strategists. That’s when it pays to have a cogent analytical framework that tells you what went wrong and why. The double-dip call was premised on three considerations: historical precedent, lingering vulnerability, and the likelihood of another shock. The history of earlier business cycles was on my side. And with employment and real output remaining well below pre-pandemic peaks – especially for face-to-face activity in the all-important services sector – there appeared to be a compelling argument for lingering vulnerability. Lastly, with a new surge of COVID infections in November, December, and early January triggering partial lockdowns in about three-fourths of all US states, the case for another shock seemed reasonable. Putting it together, I concluded that it was only a matter of time before another dip would occur. So, what happened? Basically, the shock turned out to be short-lived – also for three reasons: vaccines, human nature, and Bidenomics. Just as Americans signed up for shots, COVID infection rates plunged to just 26% of their early January peaks. That development, together with a sharply accelerated vaccination trajectory, pointed to sooner-than-expected herd immunity and a prompt end to the pandemic. Second, dismissing worrisome new COVID variants, impatient Americans and their compliant political leaders are breaking with recommended public health restrictions. And, third, the fiscal floodgates have been opened as never before: the $900 billion package of late 2020, followed by the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan in March, and now a proposed $2 trillion-plus of additional stimulus for infrastructure writ large dubbed the American Jobs Plan. With the end of COVID in sight, all this has turned into a powerful pro-cyclical fiscal stimulus, which, together with ongoing unprecedented monetary accommodation, has made the boom a one-way bet. And those ever-fickle economic indicators that were heading down late last year have now broken to the upside with a vengeance. In the end, the confluence of science, politics, and the indomitable human spirit left my out-of-consensus double-dip call in tatters. It wasn’t my first forecasting mistake, but it is probably the most glaring. Mea culpa is an understatement. Back to the ivory tower.",
            "我最糟糕的预测错误 纽黑文—我在经济预测行业工作了近50年。 我的职业生涯始于上世纪70年代初华盛顿特区美联储研究部门，后来又在华尔街干了30多年。 十多年来我在耶鲁大学工作 — — 仍时不时地涉足预测，但主要从事教学、写作和演讲。 在这么长时间里，我的预测记录好坏参半。 我在美联储做过几次值得铭记的预测，我警告过上世纪70年代中期的急剧衰退和后期棘手的通货膨胀。 但最令我自豪的是与拉里·斯利夫曼（Larry Slifman）合作构建了美联储的第一个\"黑匣子\"预测模型，我相信它在今天仍然在广泛使用。 我们连轴转地工作了几个星期，编写互相连接的基于计算机的报表（当时还鲜为人知 ） ， 以此代体此前在门罗计算器（Monroe calculator）上手动完成的月度一步迭代。 我们所谓的判断方法是美联储著名的大规模计量经济模型的针锋相对（point-counterpoint ） 。 我的华尔街生涯更富戏剧性。 我不断地预测，但更关注大局发展，如 20世纪80年代末的公司债务和重组、 90年代的 生产力辩论 、21世纪初后危机世界的全球恢复，以及我当时的“最爱 ” — — 中国及其 对全球经济的影响。 我的华尔街预测记录足以保证我的摩根士丹利工作无虞，尽管有几次颇为侥幸。 试图预测利率是我最不喜欢的工作。 这有充分的理由。 我还记得我走进老摩根士丹利投资银行会议室，看到一张我前任得债券市场预测图表倒置在地板上。 我决心避免这种命运。 当我最喜欢的债券交易员开始叫我\"飞镖人\"时，我做出了一个管理决定，从这件事上脱身，并雇佣一位利率策略师。 我想是适者生存。 去年夏天，当我从预测岗位退下，写了一篇如今令人难忘的题为《美国即将二次探底》的文章时，我应该头脑更清醒一些的 。 我认为，疫情后的反弹 — — 在2020年第三季度GDP年化增长达到创纪录的33 % ， 此前的二季度则大幅萎缩了32 % — —只不过是数字上的起伏。 但这种敏锐的洞察力并不是重点。 我接着强调，新生的复苏很可能因复发而流产，就像二战结束以来前11次衰退中的8次那样。 几个月后，我被经济指标“打脸 ” ， 但我仍然心安理得地犯了臭名昭著的预测错误：给出一个日期。 实际上，我写道，未来二次探底可能会发生在2021年年中 ， 。 我职业生涯中最糟糕的预测错误？ 看起来确实如此。 我寻找的复发并未发生，反而人满开始普遍谈论 无限繁荣。 我的训练有素的摩根士丹利后辈们敢说且正确 — — 他们预测新冠疫情冲击后将 出现V型回击 — — 现在他们认为2021年上半年美国经济年化增长率将接近10 % 。 完全不是我 — — 他们此前的团队领导人 — — 所预期的探底。 如果我还在位子上的话，我会再次因为担心饭碗不保而惊出一身冷汗。 华尔街的预测者很快学会了责任规则。 与债券和股票交易员一样 ， \" 市价计值\"思维迫使经济学家，有时甚至市场策略师，都要承担智识责任（intellectual accountability ） 。 这时候，你应该有一个有说服力的分析框架告诉你出了什么问题以及为什么会出问题。 二次探底有三个因素：历史先例、顽固的脆弱性，以及再次发生冲击的可能性。 此前的商业周期历史站在我这边。 由于就业和实际产出仍远低于疫情前的峰值水平 — — 尤其是最重要 服务行业的面对面活动 — — 似乎有令人信服的理由来认为存在顽固的脆弱性。 最后，随着11月、12月和1月初新冠感染数量再度激增，美国约 四分之三的州采取了部分封锁，新的冲击也近在眼前。 综合起来，我的结论是，二次探底只是时间问题。 那么，发生了什么？ 基本上，这种冲击是短暂的 — — 原因也有三：疫苗、人性和拜登经济学。 美国人踊跃接种，新冠感染率 跌至1月初峰值的26 % 。 这一趋势，再加上疫苗接种迅速加快，意味着比预期更快地建立群体免疫，并迅速结束疫情。 其次，不耐烦的美国人和他们的顺从的政治领导人不顾令人担忧的新冠病毒新变种，正在打破建议的公共卫生限制。 第三，财政闸门前所未有地洞开 2020年底的9000亿美元一揽子计划 ，3月份的1.9万亿美元 美国救援计划 ，以及现在提出的2万亿美元以上的被称为“美国就业计划”额外基础设施刺激。 随着疫情结束近在眼前，所有这一切变成了强力顺周期财政刺激，再加上持续前所未有的货币宽松，使得经济繁荣成为不二之选。 去年年底探底的经济指标，如今已以报复性反弹。 最后，科学、政治和不屈不挠的人类精神的合力，让我特立独行的二次探底预测成为笑话。 这不是我第一次预测错误，但它可能是最“耀眼”的。 说“责任在我”是轻描淡写。 还是回到象牙塔比较好。"

            "How Economics Survived the Economic Crisis LONDON – The tenth anniversary of the start of the Great Recession was the occasion for an elegant essay by the Nobel laureate economist Paul Krugman, who noted how little the debate about the causes and consequences of the crisis have changed over the last decade. Whereas the Great Depression of the 1930s produced Keynesian economics, and the stagflation of the 1970s produced Milton Friedman’s monetarism, the Great Recession has produced no similar intellectual shift. This is deeply depressing to young students of economics, who hoped for a suitably challenging response from the profession. Why has there been none? Krugman’s answer is typically ingenious: the old macroeconomics was, as the saying goes, “good enough for government work.” It prevented another Great Depression. So students should lock up their dreams and learn their lessons. A decade ago, two schools of macroeconomists contended for primacy: the New Classical – or the “freshwater” – School, descended from Milton Friedman and Robert Lucas and headquartered at the University of Chicago, and the New Keynesian, or “saltwater,” School, descended from John Maynard Keynes, and based at MIT and Harvard. Freshwater-types believed that budgets deficits were always bad, whereas the saltwater camp believed that deficits were beneficial in a slump. Krugman is a New Keynesian, and his essay was intended to show that the Great Recession vindicated standard New Keynesian models. But there are serious problems with Krugman’s narrative. For starters, there is his answer to Queen Elizabeth II’s now-famous question: “Why did no one see it coming?” Krugman’s cheerful response is that the New Keynesians were looking the other way. Theirs was a failure not of theory, but of “data collection.” They had “overlooked” crucial institutional changes in the financial system. While this was regrettable, it raised no “deep conceptual issue” – that is, it didn’t demand that they reconsider their theory. They dusted off their old sticky-price models from the 1950s and 1960s, which told them three things. First, very large budget deficits would not drive up near-zero interest rates. Second, even large increases in the monetary base would not lead to high inflation, or even to corresponding increases in broader monetary aggregates. And, third, there would be a positive national income multiplier, almost surely greater than one, from changes in government spending and taxation. These propositions made the case for budget deficits in the aftermath of the collapse of 2008. Policies based on them were implemented and worked “remarkably well.” The success of New Keynesian policy had the ironic effect of allowing “the more inflexible members of our profession [the New Classicals from Chicago] to ignore events in a way they couldn’t in past episodes.” So neither school – sect might be the better word – was challenged to re-think first principles. This clever history of pre- and post-crash economics leaves key questions unanswered. First, if New Keynesian economics was “good enough,” why didn’t New Keynesian economists urge precautions against the collapse of 2007-2008? After all, they did not rule out the possibility of such a collapse a priori. Krugman admits to a gap in “evidence collection.” But the choice of evidence is theory-driven. In my view, New Keynesian economists turned a blind eye to instabilities building up in the banking system, because their models told them that financial institutions could accurately price risk. So there was a “deep conceptual issue” involved in New Keynesian analysis: its failure to explain how banks might come to “underprice risk worldwide,” as Alan Greenspan put it. Second, Krugman fails to explain why the Keynesian policies vindicated in 2008-2009 were so rapidly reversed and replaced by fiscal austerity. Why didn’t policymakers stick to their stodgy fixed-price models until they had done their work? Why abandon them in 2009, when Western economies were still 4-5% below their pre-crash levels? The answer I would give is that when Keynes was briefly exhumed for six months in 2008-2009, it was for political, not intellectual, reasons. Because the New Keynesian models did not offer a sufficient basis for maintaining Keynesian policies once the economic emergency had been overcome, they were quickly abandoned. Krugman comes close to acknowledging this: New Keynesians, he writes, “start with rational behavior and market equilibrium as a baseline, and try to get economic dysfunction by tweaking that baseline at the edges.” Such tweaks enable New Keynesian models to generate temporary real effects from nominal shocks, and thus justify quite radical intervention in times of emergency. But no tweaks can create a strong enough case to justify sustained interventionist policy. The problem for New Keynesian macroeconomists is that they fail to acknowledge radical uncertainty in their models, leaving them without any theory of what to do in good times in order to avoid the bad times. Their focus on nominal wage and price rigidities implies that if these factors were absent, equilibrium would readily be achieved. They regard the financial sector as neutral, not as fundamental (capitalism’s “ephor,” as Joseph Schumpeter put it). Without acknowledgement of uncertainty, saltwater economics is bound to collapse into its freshwater counterpart. New Keynesian “tweaking” will create limited political space for intervention, but not nearly enough to do a proper job. So Krugman’s argument, while provocative, is certainly not conclusive. Macroeconomics still needs to come up with a big new idea.",
            "经济学该如何从经济危机中幸存下来 发自伦敦 — — 在“大衰退”爆发十周年之际，诺贝尔经济学奖获得者，经济学家保罗·克鲁格曼（Paul Krugman）撰写了一篇雅致的论文，指出过去十年来关于危机成因和后果的辩论基本上无甚变化。 鉴于1930年代的经济大萧条催生了凯恩斯主义经济学，而1970年代的滞胀则诞生了米尔顿·弗里德曼（Milton Friedman）的货币主义，但“大衰退”却并未产生类似的智力转变。 这对那些年轻的经济学学子来说可算是非常令人沮丧的，因为他们希望这个专业至少能做出一个有恰当挑战性的回应。 但为何却一片沉寂呢？ 克鲁格曼的答案果然极为巧妙：正如大家所认定的那样，旧有的宏观经济学“对政府工作来说已经足够了 ” ， 也阻止了另一场大萧条。 所以学生们应该把自己的梦想先放一放，先把课程学好。 十年前，两大流派的宏观经济学家都在争夺制高点：源自米尔顿·弗里德曼和罗伯特·卢卡斯（Robert Lucas ） ， 大本营位于芝加哥大学的新古典学派 — — 或所谓“淡水 ” ； 沿袭于约翰·梅纳德·凯恩斯（John Maynard Keynes ） ， 以麻省理工学院和哈佛大学为基地的新凯恩斯学派，或称“咸水 ” 。 淡水派认为预算赤字总是不好的，而咸水阵营相信赤字在经济处于低谷时是有益的。 克鲁格曼是一位新凯恩斯主义者，他的论文旨在表明“大衰退”正好证明了标准的新凯恩斯主义模式的有效性。 但克鲁格曼的叙述存在严重的问题。 首先是他对英女王伊丽莎白二世那个“为什么没有人意识到危机即将来临 ？ ” 的著名问题的回答。 克鲁格曼乐观地回应说新凯恩斯主义者当时正在专心关注其他问题。 他们的失败不是理论有问题，而是“数据收集”有误，他们“忽视”了金融体系的重大制度变迁。 虽然这确实令人扼腕，但也并未暴露出“深层次的概念问题 ” — —也就是说这并不要求他们去重新思考自己的理论。 在危机来临之时，新凯恩斯主义者奋起迎接挑战。 他们重新拾起了上世纪五六十年代的粘性价格模型，而该模型也给他们指明了三点：首先，巨额预算赤字不会推高近乎为零的利率；其次，基础货币量的更大幅增长不会导致高通胀，甚至不会导致更广意货币总量的相应增长；第三，政府支出和税收的变化会产生正面的国民收入乘数，而且该数字基本上一定会大于1。 这些主张为2008年经济崩盘后的预算赤字铺平了道路。 基于这些原则的政策得以施行而且运作得“极为良好 ” 。 而新凯恩斯主义政策取得如此成就的讽刺性作用在于允许“我们这行中那些更为缺乏灵活性的成员（芝加哥的新古典学派）以一种在过去事件中不可能发生的方式去忽略这类事件 ” ， 因此这两大学派 — — 说不上谁比谁更好 — — 都面临着重新思考自身基本原则的挑战。 这种对崩盘前和崩盘后经济学流变的机智回顾却未能解答一系列关键问题。 首先，如果新凯恩斯主义经济学真的“足够良好 ” ， 那为何新凯恩斯主义经济学家未能敦促人们对2007 ~2008年的崩溃加以防范？ 毕竟他们的推算也未排除崩盘的可能性。 克鲁格曼承认在“证据收集”方面存在差距，但证据的选择是由理论驱动的。 在我看来，新凯恩斯主义经济学家们对银行系统的不稳定性视而不见，因为他们的模型告诉他们金融机构可以准确地为风险定价。 所以在新凯恩斯主义分析中曾经出现了一个“深层次的概念问题 ” ： 它无力解释银行如何会像艾伦·格林斯潘（Alan Greenspan）所说的那样“全球一致地低估了​风险 ” 。 其二，克鲁格曼没有解释为何在2008~2009年被证明有效的凯恩斯主义政策会如此迅速地被财政紧缩政策逆转和取代。 为什么政策制定者未能在完工之前一直坚持使用那套古板的固定价格模型呢？ 为什么在2009年西方经济体经济总量仍然低于事件发生前水平4~5％的时候就放弃了它们呢？ 我所给出的答案是，当凯恩斯主义在2008~2009年间被短暂起用了六个月时，这是出于政治而非理智的原因。 由于一系列新凯恩斯主义模型在度过了经济紧张时期后未能为凯恩斯主义政策提供充分的依据，所以很快就被抛弃了。 克鲁格曼几乎承认了这一点：他写道，新凯恩斯主义者“以理性行为和市场均衡为基准线，试图通过对基准线的边缘微调来应对经济功能失调 ” 。 这种微调使得新凯恩斯主义模型能够通过名义货币上的冲击产生暂时性的真实作用，从而证明在紧急情况下实施相当激进的干预手段是合理的。 但是没有任何微调措施可以为持续的干预政策创造足够强大的理由。 新凯恩斯主义宏观经济学家面临的问题在于不愿承认自身模型中存在的极端不确定性，以致缺乏任何理论来指导在景气时期应该做些什么以避免不景气。 他们对名义工资和价格刚性的关注似乎意味着倘若不存在这些因素，均衡就能被毫不费力地实现。 他们认为金融部门是中性的，而不是基础性的 — — 正如约瑟夫·熊彼特（Joseph Schumpeter）所说的那样是资本主义的“监察官 ” 。 如果不承认这一不确定性，咸水经济学派必然会沦落到跟淡水学派一个德行。 新凯恩斯主义的“微调”可以为干预行为创造出有限的政治空间，但还不足以恰当地完成整个工作。 因此克鲁格曼的论点虽然让人觉得有点道理，但肯定还算不上是定论。 宏观经济学还有待提出一个新的大理论来支撑。"

            "Why a Sino-American Cold War Won’t Happen OXFORD – It is often said that the US and China – superpowers at economic, geopolitical, and ideological loggerheads – are heading toward a new cold war. And the rhetoric – at least from one side – has come to resemble that of Winston Churchill’s 1946 “Iron Curtain” speech, one of the inaugural events of the Cold War. Just this month, US Vice President Mike Pence accused China of predatory economic practices, military aggression against the United States, and attempts to undermine US President Donald Trump. But despite the media hype, a new cold war is not inevitable – or even likely. To be sure, Chinese leaders, fearing disorder and any weakening of the Communist Party of China’s legitimacy, are determined to prevent the US from forcing changes on China’s political and economic system. China will continue to pursue reforms at its own pace and in its own way. For Chinese President Xi Jinping, a top priority is to merge the CPC with the machinery of government in order to reduce corruption and burnish the state’s ideological credentials. Any attempt to interfere in this process would be crossing a red line. Fortunately for Xi, Trump has no interest in “democratizing” other countries, and he doesn’t seem to have been swayed by the US investors, financiers, and technology titans who want his administration to press for more access to the Chinese economy. No doubt, US tariffs threaten the 18% of Chinese exports that go to the US each year. But the Trump administration has more urgent priorities than changing China’s system of government, notwithstanding the aggressive rhetoric of US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and White House National Trade Council Director Peter Navarro. Trump desperately wants to bolster US manufacturing by repatriating global supply chains and blocking or curbing imports. “Make America Great Again” is really about making in America again. Still, even if today’s US-China standoff does not evolve into a new cold war, it could weaken both countries and usher in a more multipolar world. Within China, US rhetorical broadsides, tariffs, and sanctions may be empowering Xi’s domestic critics. And it doesn’t help that China currently has limited options for retaliating. True, it could start to sell off some of its $1 trillion in US dollar reserves. But that would weaken the value of the US Treasuries that it continues to hold. Within the US, Trump’s decision to pursue sweeping import tariffs has been described by one industry representative as “the most self-destructive trade act I’ve ever seen.” And the administration’s renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement – which includes a clause to prevent Canada or Mexico from negotiating with China – has met with similar disdain. Such policies threaten both to destroy US jobs and to alienate America’s allies, many of which are already distancing themselves. Indeed, the Trump administration’s “America First” positions have increasingly translated into “America Alone.” The US now constitutes a minority of one within the G7, the G20, and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. After Trump pulled the US out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), the remaining parties moved ahead on their own. Far from setting the terms of debate on international issues, the Trump administration has convinced other countries to reduce their reliance on US leadership. Widespread circumvention of the US will hasten the emergence of a new multipolar order. For example, by withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal, Trump has essentially dared the United Kingdom, France, Germany, China, Russia, and the European Union to defy US prerogatives. For now, countries that rely on Iranian oil may have no choice but to go along with the US. Like most traded goods, oil exports are paid for in dollars – largely through the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) in Belgium – and the US has the power to shut down such transactions. Most companies and countries have concluded that doing business in Iran is not worth losing access to the US market and the international dollar-payments system. But in the future, they may no longer have to make such tradeoffs. On August 21, Germany’s foreign minister, Heiko Maas, urged Europe to establish payment channels that are independent of the US. And the following month, the EU’s foreign policy chief announced plans to form a “special purpose vehicle” to “assist and reassure economic operators pursuing legitimate business with Iran.” Meanwhile, Russia has said that it is developing its own system for financial transfers, to protect itself from being shut out of the SWIFT system in the event of harsher US sanctions. And China has been pursuing a similar project at least since 2015, when the People’s Bank of China launched a system to facilitate cross-border transactions in renminbi. None of these alternative systems have yet to match the convenience of SWIFT and the dollar system. But if a new system were to take hold, it could rapidly shift power away from the US. Rather than a cold war, the world may be heading toward an international system led by four powers, with the US, China, Russia, and Germany dominating their respective regions and seeking the upper hand in international negotiations. Such a scenario is reminiscent of the World War II vision of US President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who proposed that the four victorious allies – the US, the UK, China, and the Soviet Union – act as “Four Policemen,” each patrolling its own sphere of influence and negotiating with the others on world peace. Today, approximations of the same four powers are once again in the lead, only now we have stronger international institutions to help keep the peace. Whether that peace lasts will depend on the willingness of the four powers to use and adapt those institutions to the emerging international system.",
            "为何中美冷战不会发生 牛津—经常有人说美国和中国 — — 经济、地缘政治和意识形态的超级大国 — — 正在走向新冷战。 其说辞 — — 至少从一方看 — — 类似于丘吉尔1946年的《铁幕》演说。 丘吉尔的这次演说是冷战拉开序幕的标志性事件之一。 这个月，美国副总统彭斯指责中国的掠夺性经济政策、对美军事侵略，以及试图削弱美国总统特朗普。 但是，媒体固热闹，然则新冷战并非不可避免 — — 甚至连发生的可能性都很小。 诚然，中国领导人担心失序和中共在中国的合法性削弱，必然会阻止美国迫使中国改变政治和经济制度。 中国将继续以自己的节奏和方式实施改革。 对中国国家主席习近平而言，重中之重是将中共与政府机器融合在一起，消除腐败，让国家的意识形态闪光。 一切干扰这一进程的动作都会被视为越过红线。 对习近平来说，幸运的是特朗普没兴趣“民主化”其他国家，也没有被迫切想要更深入中国经济的美国投资者、金融家和科技巨头动摇。 毫无疑问，美国的关税威胁着中国对美出口年度总量的18 % 。 但改变中国治国的制度（system of government）不是特朗普政府最紧迫的重点工作，尽管美国贸易代表罗伯特·莱特希泽（Robert Lighthizer）和白宫国家贸易委员会主任彼得·纳瓦罗（Peter Navarro）气势汹汹。 特朗普急于通过让全球供应链回流以及阻止和削减进口来提振美国制造业。 “让美国再次伟大”其实就是让美国再次制造。 尽管如此，即便当下的美中僵局没有演化为新冷战，也有可能让两国两败俱伤，形成更加多极化的世界。 在中国国内，美国言辞激烈的抨击、关税以及制裁可能会让习近平的国内批评者得势。 中国目前报复手段有限也是个问题。 诚然，它可以抛售部分1万亿美元储备。 但这将让其剩下的美国国债价值缩水。 在美国国内，特朗普征收全面进口关税的决定被某产业代表描述为“我所见过的最为自杀性的贸易政策 。 ” 其政府重新谈判北美自由贸易协定 — — 其中一个条款禁止加拿大和墨西哥与中国进行谈判 — — 也遭到了类似的抨击。 这些政策有可能会毁掉美国的就业岗位，疏远美国的盟友 — — 其中许多已开始自我疏远。 事实上，特朗普政府的“美国优先”立场已日益转变为“美国孤立 ” 。 目前，美国已是G7、G20和联合国气候变化框架公约的孤家寡人。 特朗普令美国退出跨太平洋合作伙伴关系（TPP）后，其他各方在继续前进。 特朗普政府没能为国际问题的争论制定规范，反而让其他国家决定降低对美国领导的依赖。 普遍的规避美国现象将加快新多极秩序的出现。 比如，特朗普退出伊朗核协议其实起到了让英国、法国、德国、中国、俄罗斯和欧盟敢于否认美国的特权的效果。 现在，需要依靠伊朗石油的国家可能别无选择，只能与美国站边。 和大部分贸易品一样，石油出口用美元支付 — — 主要是通过位于比利时的世界银行间通讯协会（SWIFT）进行 — — 美国有权力切断这些交易。 大部分公司和国家认为与伊朗做生意还无法与失去美国市场和国际美元支付体系相提并论。 但在未来，它们也许根本不必做出这样的权衡。 8月21日，德国外交部长海科·马斯（Heiko Maas）敦促欧洲建立独立于美国的支付渠道。 9月，欧盟外交政策长官宣布准备成立“特殊目的机构”以“协助和确保经济运营者与伊朗进行合法的业务往来 。 ” 与此同时，俄罗斯说它正在开发自己的金融转账系统，以免因为美国制裁升级而被排斥在SWIFT系统之外。 中国则至少从2015年就开始实施类似的计划，中国人民银行推出了便利跨境人民币交易的系统。 目前，这些替代方案无一能够比拟SWIFT和美元系统的便利性。 但如果新系统站稳了脚跟，就有可能迅速从美国手中夺取权力。 世界可能没在迈向冷战，而是在迈向由四方力量领导的国际体系，美国、中国、俄罗斯和德国主导各自的地区，并在国际谈判中争夺上风。 这一情景让人想起了美国总统小罗斯福的二战愿景 — — 他提出由美国、英国、中国和苏联四个战胜同盟国组成“四大警察 ” ， 各自巡查自己的势力范围，并与其他三方协商世界和平。 如今，基本相同的四股力量再一次领先，只不过这一次我们拥有更强大的国际制度帮助维持和平。 和平能否持续将取决于四强运用和调整这些制度，使之与新形成的国际体系匹配的意愿。"

            "Natural-Born Pianists? LONDON – The editor of The Guardian, Alan Rusbridger, has written a book about how he decided to practice the piano 20 minutes a day. Eighteen months later, he played Chopin’s fearsomely difficult Ballade No. 1 in G Minor to an admiring audience of friends. Could anyone have done this? Or did it require special talent? The nature-versus-nurture debate has been around a long time. It is unresolved because the scientific question has always been entangled with politics. Broadly speaking, those stressing inborn capacity have been political conservatives; those emphasizing nurture have been political radicals. The nineteenth-century philosopher John Stuart Mill was of the “anyone can do it” school. He was convinced that his achievements were in no way due to superior heredity: anyone of “normal intelligence and health,” subjected to his father’s educational system – which included learning Greek at the age of three – could have become John Stuart Mill. Mill was part of his century’s liberal attack on aristocratic privilege: achievement was the result of opportunity, not birth. The practice of the faculties (education) unleashes potential that would otherwise remain dormant. Charles Darwin seemingly overturned this optimistic view of the potential beneficial effects of nurture. Species evolve, Darwin said, through “natural selection” – the random selection, through competition, of biological traits favorable to survival in a world of scarce resources. Herbert Spencer used the phrase “survival of the fittest” to explain how societies evolve. Social Darwinists interpreted natural selection to mean that any humanitarian effort to improve the condition of the poor would impede the progress of the human race by burdening it with an excess of drones. Society would be spending scarce resources on losers rather than winners. This fit the ideology of a brand of capitalism that was “red in tooth and claw.” Indeed, social Darwinism provided a pseudo-scientific justification for the American belief in laissez-faire (with the successful businessman epitomizing the survival of the fittest); for eugenics (the deliberate attempt to breed superior individuals, on the model of horse-breeding, and prevent the “over-breeding” of the unfit); and for the eugenic-cum-racial theories of Nazism. In reaction to social Darwinism’s murderous tendencies, Mill’s view became dominant after World War II in the form of social democracy. State action to improve diet, education, health, and housing would enable the poor to realize their potential. Competition as a social principle was downgraded in favor of cooperation. Differences in innate ability were not denied (at least by the sensible). But it was rightly felt that there was a huge amount of work to be done to raise average levels of achievement before one needed to start worrying that one’s policies were promoting the survival of the unfit. Then the mood began to shift again. Social democracy was attacked for penalizing the successful and rewarding the unsuccessful. In 1976, the biologist Richard Dawkins identified the unit of Darwinian selection as the “selfish gene.” The evolutionary story was now recast as a battle of genes to secure their survival over time by means of mutations, which create individuals (phenotypes) best adapted to pass on their genes. In the course of evolution, the inferior phenotypes disappear. Although this view of evolution would not have been possible before the discovery of DNA, it is no coincidence that it rose to prominence in the age of Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher. To be sure, the selfish gene needs to be “altruistic” insofar as its survival depends on the survival of the kinship group. But it need not be that altruistic. And, although Dawkins later regretted calling his gene “selfish” (he says that “immortal” would have been better), his choice of adjective was certainly best adapted to maximizing sales of his book at that particular time. Since then, we have turned away from advocacy of selfishness, but we have not recovered an independent moral language. The new orthodoxy, suitable for a world in which the unrestrained pursuit of greed has proved economically disastrous, is that the human species is genetically programmed to be moral, because only by acting morally (caring for the survival of others) can it ensure its long-term survival. The “hard-wiring” metaphor dominates contemporary moral language. According to the United Kingdom’s chief rabbi, Jonathan Sacks, religious beliefs are useful for our survival, by inducing us to act in socially cooperative ways: “We have mirror neurons that lead us to feel pain when we see others suffering,” he recently wrote. Consideration for others is “located in the prefrontal cortex.” And religion “reconfigures our neural pathways.” In short: “Far from refuting religion, the Neo-Darwinists have helped us understand why it matters.” So we need not fear that it will decline. Atheists might not agree. But it is an extraordinary statement for a religious leader to make, because it sets to one side the question of the truth or falsehood, or the ethical value, of religious beliefs. Or rather: all that wiring in the prefrontal cortex must be ethical, because it is good for survival. But, in that case, what ethical value is there in survival? Does the continued survival of the human race have any value in itself, independent of what we achieve or create? We need to rescue morality from the claims of science. We need to assert what philosophers and religious teachers have at all times asserted: that there is something called the good life, apart from survival, and our understanding of it has to be taught, just as Mill’s father taught him the elements of Aristotle’s Posterior Analytics. Our nature may predispose us to learn; but what we learn depends on how we are nurtured.",
            "天生钢琴家？ 伦敦 一 《卫报》编辑艾伦·拉斯布里哲（Alan Rusbridger）写了一部关于他如何决定每天弹20分钟钢琴的书。 18个月后，他弹出了肖邦难度极高的G小调一号叙事曲，围观亲友为之倾倒。 任何人都能做到这一点吗？ 还是说着需要特别的天分？ 先天-后天争论由来已久，至今仍未解决，因为这一科学问题总是与政治纠结不清。 大体说来，强调天赋异禀的是政治保守派，强调后天的是政治激进派。 19世纪哲学家约翰·穆勒是“人人都是天才”派成员。 他相信他的成就跟基因优良毫无关系：任何“智力和健康状况正常者”在其父的教育制度下 — — 包括从三岁开始学习希腊文 — — 都可以变成约翰·穆勒。 穆勒是当时对贵族特权发起攻击的人之一：成就来自机会，而不是出身。 学校（教育）实践能激发隐藏的潜能。 查尔斯·达尔文似乎扭转了这一后天努力潜在积极影响的乐观观点。 达尔文说，物种通过“自然选择”进化 — — 即通过竞争随机选择生物特征有利于在资源稀缺的世界生存的物种。 赫伯特·斯宾塞用“适者生存”来解释社会演化。 社会达尔文主义者对自然选择的解读是，这意味着改善穷人条件的人道主义努力会产生过多的懒汉，从而阻碍人种进步。 社会将把稀缺资源用于输家而不是赢家。 这符合“野蛮”资本主义观念。 事实上，社会达尔文主义为美国人的自由放任信仰（成功商人即生存下来的适者 ） 、 优生学（按照育马模式有意识地选育超级个人，防止不适者的“过度繁育 ” ） 以及纳粹的优等人种理论提供了伪科学的论据。 为了对付社会达尔文主义这残暴倾向，穆勒的观点在二战后以社会民主的形式成为主流。 改善饮食、教育、卫生和住房条件的国家行动能让穷人实现自己的潜能。 竞争作为社会原则，其重要性不如合作。 先天能力的差别并没有被否认（至少理智者没有否认 ） 。 但一种正确的观念是可以通过大量工作提高成就的平均水平，然后再开始担心某政策会有利于不适者的生存不迟。 接着，情绪又开始了转变。 社会民主受到了抨击，因为它惩罚成功者，奖励不成功者。 1976年，生物学家理查德·道金斯识别出达尔文主义选择单元，称之为“自私的基因 ” 。 如今，进化的故事被演绎成基因生存战，随着时间的推移，各种基因通过突变保证其生存，于是产生了最适于传递基因的表型。 在进化过程中，劣等表型消失了。 尽管这一进化观点在DNA发现之前根本不可能出现，但其在里根和撒切尔时代成为主流并非巧合。 平心而论，在生存取决于亲族的生存时，自私的基因需要“利他 ” 。 但此利他非彼利他。 此外，尽管道金斯后来又后悔将他的基因称为“自私 ” （ 他说 ， “ 不朽”更合适 ） ， 但他对形容词的选择毫无疑问最适合在当时的特定时期最大化其著作销��。 此后，我们开始远离自私论，但尚未重新找到新的独立道德规则。 新正统 — — 适合不受约束的贪婪已被证明市场灾难的世界 — — 是人类基因程序设定是让其符合道德，因为有道德（关心他人生存）能保证其自身的长期生存。 “硬接线”比喻主导着当代道德观念。 根据英国首席拉比乔纳森·萨克斯（Jonathan Sachs）的说法，宗教信仰有利于我们的生存，因为它让我们的行为变成社会合作：他最近写道“我们拥有镜像神经元，这让我们在目睹他人遭难时感同身受 。 ” 而宗教“重新配置了我们的神经通路 。 ” 简而言之 ， “ 新达尔文主义绝不排斥宗教，反而有助于我们理解为何宗教很重要 。 ” 因此我们不必担心宗教衰落。 无神论者可能不会同意。 但宗教领袖作此言论是极不寻常的，因为这集中于真理和谬误，或宗教信仰的道德价值问题的一面。 或者说，所有前额皮质内的通路都是道德的，因为这有助于我们的生存。 但是，既然如此，那里生存着什么道德价值呢？ 人类的持续生存自有其价值，不论我们的成就和创造吗？ 我们需要从科学角度拯救道德。 我们需要维护哲学家和宗教导师时刻教导的 — — 有一种东西叫美好生活（good life ） ， 它独立于生存之外，对它的理解需要有人教导，正如穆勒的父亲教他亚里士多德《后分析篇》的内容。 我们的天性或许能驱使我们学习，但学习什么取决于后天接受。"

            "Obama’s Rocky Path to Success in Syria NEW YORK – In my experience, if you are attacked for your diplomacy from both left and right, by doves and hawks, and by internationalists and isolationists, you probably have it just right. In the avalanche of commentary on this month’s US-Russia deal on Syria’s chemical weapons, few have been prepared to call it a “win-win-win” outcome for the United States, Russia, and the Syrian people. But – at least so far – that is what it is. President Barack Obama and his team, despite some missteps, deserve most of the credit. The charge sheet against Obama over Syria is long. The US, it is said, took no decisive action while 100,000 Syrians were dying, and it had no strategy to end the conflict. Obama created expectations that the US would act if chemical weapons were used, only to stall when the time came. Then, when a response became unavoidable, he threatened both too much and too little military force. He paid too little, then too much, attention to domestic opponents of intervention. Above all, he allowed an ever-cynical Kremlin to outplay the US diplomatically. But consider the constraints. There was never a time in the crisis, until the chemical-weapons issue erupted, when US military intervention in any form seemed likely to save more lives than it would endanger. The increasing influence of jihadists in the rebel ranks made support for an outright opposition victory increasingly untenable. There simply was not enough hard evidence of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s use of chemical weapons, at least before the Ghouta massacre in August, to pressure Russia – either in the United Nations Security Council or the court of global opinion – to reconsider its reflex support of the regime. Moreover, while the Obama administration remained determined to preserve US leadership in responding – with force, where necessary – to mass atrocity crimes (the global “responsibility to protect” agenda), a decade of fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan has left Americans desperately war-weary. That is true in the West generally, as shown by the United Kingdom’s parliamentary vote against participating in any intervention. For almost everyone, George W. Bush’s “decisiveness” made vacillation seem like a better option. Against this background, consider what Obama has achieved. A descent into chemical-weapons hell has been averted, almost certainly permanently: the Assad regime knows that it has no friends or protectors left should it cross that red line again. Military intervention, with all of its problems, has been avoided for now; but Assad knows that the US will have no option but to attack – with or without explicit Security Council and Congressional resolutions – should he perpetrate another such horror. Above all, diplomatic cooperation on chemical weapons has opened the door at last to a negotiated settlement of the underlying conflict in Syria. And the UN is back at center stage, as a rules-based international order demands that it should be on such issues, with both its weapons inspectors and the Security Council regarded as central to future developments. Yes, there were some things that could and should have been done differently. There always are. If the justified intervention in Libya by the US, the UK, and France had not later been conducted with such cloth-eared indifference to Russian, Chinese, and developing-country concern about mandate overreach, greater unity on Syria could have been achieved in the Security Council in 2011, when a united message might have stopped Assad cold. Going to Congress for approval was always going to involve more risks than rewards. Secretary of State John Kerry’s description of the planned US military response to the Ghouta massacre as likely to be “unbelievably small” almost derailed the utility of the US threat in concentrating Syrian and Russian officials’ minds. And the administration could have helped itself by better explaining that a cooperative response to the Assad regime’s use of chemical weapons had long been on the table, and was not just the result of deftly opportunistic Russian diplomacy in response to a Kerry thought-bubble. What has trumped these missteps, and enabled each side to focus on opportunities rather than excuses, is that both the US and Russia now understand that they have common interests in Syria. Both sides want not only to preclude the Assad regime’s further use of chemical weapons, but also to find a route to sustainable peace in Syria, and to reestablish the authority and utility of the UN in these situations. Of course, optimism must be tempered. Plenty can go wrong in the period ahead. Either a beleaguered Assad or an increasingly desperate opposition might destroy the deal on the ground. The fragile rapprochement between the US and Russia may not hold, particularly if the US again insists – breaking its recent helpful silence – that Assad has no place at the negotiating table. But when the major powers cooperate in a just cause, the world is a safer and saner place. That is where both the US and Russia – and on this issue China as well – want to be. If Obama’s caution and flexibility have been the key to getting us here, let us give praise where it is due.",
            "奥巴马在叙利亚艰难的成功之路 纽约 — — 以我的经验，如果左右翼势力、鸽派和鹰派、国际主义者和孤立主义者同时攻击你的外交政策，那么你的政策可能恰到好处。 在对本月美俄叙利亚化武交易雪片般的评论中，很少有人认为这是美国、俄国和叙利亚民众共赢的结果。 但至少从目前看，恰恰出现了这样的状况。 虽然有些失误，但大部分功劳应当归结于奥巴马总统及其团队。 奥巴马在叙利亚有很多可以指责的东西。 人人都说美国在100,000叙利亚民众面临死亡时没有采取果断行动，也没有拿出结束冲突的策略。 奥巴马创造了启用化学武器就会招致美国军事行动的预期，但那一刻真正到来时却又找出各种托辞。 之后，当不可避免要做出反应时，他总是言辞威胁，却极少诉诸武力。 他先是太不注重、之后又太过注重国内反对干预的势力。 最重要的是，他让玩世不恭的克里姆林在外交上抢占了先机。 但我们必须考虑到其中的诸多限制。 直到化武问题爆发之前，美国军事干预在危机中害人的机率从来都大于救人的机率。 圣战者在叛军队伍中的影响日益扩大让反对派获得全胜的可能性越来越小。 至少在叙利亚总统巴沙尔·阿萨德在8月的古塔（Ghouta）大屠杀中使用化学武器之前，无论是在联合国安理会还是全球舆情领域，根本没有足够的铁证能够迫使俄国重新考虑其对阿萨德政权的习惯性支持。 此外，虽然奥巴马政府依然决心维护美国在应对大规模暴行（全球“保护责任”议程 ） （ 必要的话不排除武力应对）中的领导地位，十年的伊拉克和阿富汗战争已经让美国人感到极度疲惫。 这种情绪在西方非常普遍，比如英国议会就投票反对参与任何干预行动。 几乎所有人都认为乔治·W·布什的“果断”还不如犹豫。 在这样的背景下再看看奥巴马取得的成绩。 堕入化武地狱的恐怖局面已经避免，而且几乎肯定具有永久性：阿萨德政权知道如果再次越过红线朋友和保护伞都将不复存在。 能造成诸多问题的军事干预至少目前得以避免；但阿萨德知道不管有没有明确的安理会和国会决议，如果他再次进行这样的恐怖活动，美国将别无选择只能干预。 最重要的是，化武外交合作最终打开了谈判解决叙利亚冲突的大门。 联合国也像以规则为基础的国际秩序所要求的那样回到了舞台的中央，武器核查人员和安理会被视为未来形势发展的核心角色。 是的，总有些问题可以而且应当采取不同的处理方式。 永远会有改进的余地。 如果美、英、法等国的正当干预后来没有以无视俄、中和其他发展中国家对越权干预担心的方式进行，安理会在2011年或许就能在叙利亚问题上更加团结，各方发出的联合讯息或许已经阻止了阿萨德的胡作非为。 报请国会批准所伴随的风险几乎肯定要大于收益。 约翰·克里国务卿有关美国对古塔大屠杀的军事应对计划可能“令人难以置信的微不足道”的描述几乎彻底消灭了美国在叙利亚和俄罗斯官员眼中的威胁。 而奥巴马政府更好地解释对阿萨德政权使用化武的合作策略其实一直存在，而并非俄国对克里思想泡沫所做出的灵光一现的机会主义外交反应可能会有所帮助。 美国和俄罗斯现在清楚他们在叙利亚拥有共同利益掩盖了这些失误，使得各方对机会而不是借口更加关注。 双方想要的不只是杜绝阿萨德政权进一步使用化学武器，而且要找到叙利亚持久和平之路，并且重建联合国在类似情况下的权威和效用。 当然，还必须逐步培养乐观主义。 今后还有很多��以犯的错误。 身处困境的阿萨德或者越来越绝望的反对派都有可能破坏已经达成的协议。 美俄之间的脆弱和解可能无法坚持，特别是如果美国打破近来有益的沉默，再次提出谈判桌上没有阿萨德的位置。 不过当大国合作完成正义的事业，世界就会变得更加安全和理智。 那是美国、俄国（在叙利亚问题上还有中国）希望看到的结果。 如果奥巴马的谨慎和灵活是我们实现目标的关键所在，那么让我们不吝给予它应有的评价。"

            "The US with Iran in Syria PRINCETON – The prospect of a US military strike on Syria has dimmed following President Barack Obama’s embrace of an international initiative to take control of Syria’s chemical-weapons stockpile. The eleventh-hour U-turn on the push for military action has come against a backdrop of intensifying diplomatic pressure from the international community to avoid escalation of the violence in Syria. And that outcome is not possible without Iran. In a joint press conference with his Syrian counterpart, Walid al-Moallem, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov tabled a proposal, originally agreed with Iran, calling for Syria to “place chemical weapons storage sites under international control.” The stockpiles would then be destroyed and Syria would fully join the international Chemical Weapons Convention. The second component of the Russian-Iranian proposal calls for international efforts, under the auspices of the United Nations Security Council, to rein in Syrian rebel forces’ chemical-weapons capabilities. Moallem immediately embraced the proposal. Hours later, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon did as well, while Obama said that “I fervently hope that this can be resolved in a non-military way.” This initiative would allow Obama to escape from a messy political and foreign-policy predicament. But the matter is far from settled: Obama has not ruled out a military strike. So here are 12 reasons why America should grasp the opportunity for a diplomatic resolution afforded by the Russian-Iranian plan. First, there is evidence that the Syrian opposition has amassed chemical weapons. In December 2012, Iran officially informed the US about chemical weapons, including sarin gas, being transferred to Syria. The US declined to cooperate with Iran to press ahead on the case. Second, US military strikes on Syria have the potential to engulf the entire region – and perhaps the US – in a broader war. After its experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq over the past decade, the US can hardly afford a Syrian quagmire. Third, with the regional Sunni-Shia conflict intensifying, the prospect of tens of billions of petrodollars backing terrorist extremists has already destabilized the region. US military strikes against Syria would further fuel extremism and result in widespread atrocities by the rebels against Syrians of all faiths. Reports point to the execution and mutilation of Syrian-government prisoners. There is no doubt that the fate of Syria’s Christian and Jewish communities is now extremely precarious. Fourth, America’s decision to back extremists in Syria contradicts its “war on terrorism” and will erode international support for it. The prospect of Iranian cooperation to root out Al Qaeda extremists, which it provided in Afghanistan and Iraq, would be unlikely following any intervention. Fifth, it is wrong to assume that without Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, Iran would lose its influence in the Muslim world as well as its link to Hezbollah in Lebanon. America’s regional position weakened, and Iran’s strengthened, following the US-led invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq; US intervention in Syria could reproduce that pattern. Sixth, a US attack on Syria would leave the US isolated internationally and end any hope of a diplomatic resolution. There is no domestic or international appetite for another US military adventure – NATO, the G-20, the Europeans, Russia, China, and 60% of Americans oppose a unilateral US military strike. Seventh, the civilian casualties arising from a military strike would be high. If the main justification for an attack is humanitarian – to end the senseless slaughter of Syrian civilians – US military intervention would do more harm than good. Eighth, US involvement in Syria will breathe new life into efforts to press for a wider war between the US and Iran. Al Qaeda affiliates will target US regional interests in the hope that the blame falls on Iran and its militant proxies – providing a pretext for US military confrontation. Ninth, a US military strike against a third Muslim-majority country would demolish the credibility of Obama’s efforts to repair America’s image in the Islamic world. Indeed, it would most likely prove to be a strategic boon to the “resistance axis” – Iran and Hezbollah. Tenth, any US unilateral military strike against Syria would ratchet up tensions between the US and Russia. This, in turn, would strengthen the Russia-Iran alliance. Eleventh, Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has issued permission for President Hassan Rouhani’s new administration to enter into direct talks with the US. No better opportunity to end decades of bilateral hostility is likely to come along. In these circumstances, a US attack on Syria would almost certainly dash any hope of a US-Iran rapprochement for years to come. Finally, with the moderate Rouhani now installed as President, a US military strike could undermine a golden opportunity for America and Iran to reach a face-saving solution (for both sides) on Iran’s nuclear program. Both Iran and the US consider the use of weapons of mass destruction a grave crime. Indeed, Iran was a major victim of chemical-weapons attacks during its 1980-1988 war with Saddam Hussein’s Iraq. Iran can be a major partner to halt proliferation of WMDs in Syria, the Middle East, and beyond. Iran maintains that the Security Council is the only body legally authorized to verify allegations concerning the use of such deadly weapons and to decide on the appropriate response. One promising avenue for US-Iran cooperation on Syria could be joint support for a fact-finding mission by the Security Council to identify the perpetrators. Obama has his “red line” on the use of chemical weapons. So does Khamenei.",
            "美国和伊朗在叙利亚 普林斯顿 — — 继美国总统奥巴马接受控制叙利亚化学武器库存的国际倡议之后，美国军事打击叙利亚的可能性已经越来越小。 国际社会呼吁避免叙利亚暴力活动升级的外交压力越来越强，直接导致了此次军事行动在最后时刻调头。 没有伊朗的参与根本不可能实现这一目标。 在与叙利亚外长瓦利德·穆阿利姆的联合新闻发布会上，俄罗斯外长拉夫罗夫提出了一份最初与伊朗达成一致的议案，呼吁叙利亚“将化学武器的储存点置于国际控制之下 。 ” 化学武器库存将会被销毁，同时叙利亚将全面加入国际《禁止化学武器公约 》 。 俄伊提案的第二部分呼吁在联合国安理会主持下展开国际努力，以遏制叙利亚叛军使用化学武器。 穆阿利姆立即接受了这项提议。 几小时后，联合国秘书长潘基文也表示赞同，奥巴马则表示“我热切希望能够以非军事方式解决这一问题 。 ” 这项倡议能使奥巴马摆脱杂乱无章的政治和外交政策困局。 但问题还远远没有解决：奥巴马并没有彻底放弃军事打击。 因此有12条理由支持美国抓住俄伊计划所带来的叙利亚问题的外交解决机会。 首先，有证据表明叙利亚反对派已经积聚了化学武器。 2012年12月，伊朗正式通知美国有迹象表明沙林毒气等化学武器正在运往叙利亚国内。 美国拒绝与伊朗合作解决这一问题。 其次，美国军事打击叙利亚有可能引燃大规模战火吞噬整个地区 — — 甚至可能包括美国自己。 有了过去10年在阿富汗和伊拉克的经历，再次陷入叙利亚泥潭超出了美国的承受能力。 第三，在逊尼派和什叶派冲突加剧的大背景下，数以亿计的石油美元支持恐怖主义极端分子的预期已经破坏了地区的稳定局势。 美军事打击叙利亚将进一步助长极端主义，导致叛军对所有信仰的叙利亚人发动大规模暴行。 报告直指对叙利亚政府囚犯的处决和酷刑。 叙利亚基督教和犹太教群体的命运现在无疑极不稳定。 第四，美国决定支持叙利亚极端分子与它的“反恐战争”自相矛盾，并将削弱国际社会对反恐的支持。 如果真的进行军事干预，几乎不可能指望伊朗像在阿富汗和伊拉克那样协助消灭“基地”极端分子。 第五，假设没有叙利亚总统巴沙尔·阿萨德，伊朗就会失去在穆斯林世界的影响力和与黎巴嫩真主党的联系根本就没有依据。 在以美国为首的阿富汗及伊拉克入侵行动后，美国的地区地位有所削弱，而伊朗则反之。 第六，袭击叙利亚将导致美国在国际上陷入孤立，而且再没有希望通过外交途径解决问题。 美国国内或国际社会都不愿看到美国再次进行军事冒险 — — 北约、G-20、欧洲、俄罗斯、中国和60%的美国人都反对美国单方面发动军事打击。 第七，军事打击将造成大量的平民伤亡。 如果发动袭击的主要理由是人道主义（结束对叙利亚平民的毫无意义的屠杀 ） ， 美国军事干预将弊大于利。 第八，美国卷入叙利亚内战将为游说美伊大规模开战的势力注入新的生命力。 基地组织分支机构将针对性打击美国的地区利益，希望将责任推给伊朗及其好战代理 — — 进而为美国军事对抗创造托辞。 第九，美国第三次对以穆斯林为主的国家发动军事袭击将摧毁奥巴马政府修复美国在伊斯兰世界形象努力的可信性。 事实上，最后袭击很可能被证明是对伊朗和真主党等“抵抗轴心”的战略福音。 第十，美国对叙利亚的任何单边军事打击都可能加剧美俄两国间的紧张关系。 这将反过来增强俄伊联盟的实力。 十一，伊朗最高领袖哈梅内伊许可新组建的哈桑·鲁哈尼总统政府与美国直接会谈。 恐怕不会有比这更好的机会结束几十年的双边敌对关系。 在这种情况下，美国对叙利亚的袭击几乎肯定将使今后几年的美伊和解希望完全破灭。 最后，因为温和派的鲁哈尼目前担任总统，美国的军事打击可能破坏美伊双方就伊朗核计划达成能为双方保存颜面的方案的黄金机会。 伊朗和美国都认为使用大规模杀伤性武器是一种严重的罪行。 事实上，伊朗曾经是1980-1988年与萨达姆·侯赛因的两伊战争中化学武器袭击的主要受害者。 伊朗可以成为制止大规模杀伤性武器在叙利亚、中东和全世界扩散的主要合作伙伴。 伊朗认为安理会是验证与使用上述致命武器相关指控并决定合理对策的唯一的合法授权机构。 美伊就叙利亚问题合作的唯一正当途径是联合支持安理会事实调查团，明确真正的肇事者。 奥巴马的“红线”是不容许使用化学武器。 哈梅内伊也同样如此。"

            "Why Pay More for Fairness? Marks & Spencer, a supermarket and clothing chain with 400 stores throughout Britain, recently announced that it is converting its entire range of coffee and tea, totaling 38 lines, to Fairtrade, a marketing symbol of “ethical production.” The chain already sells only Fairtrade tea and coffee in its 200 Café Revive coffee shops. It is also boosting its purchases of shirts and other goods made with Fairtrade cotton. The announcement came during “Fairtrade Fortnight,” a two-week promotion of Fairtrade products that included speaking tours by farmers from developing countries, telling Britons how Fairtrade has assisted their communities. The movement toward more ethical consumption has made significant gains in the United States as well, as consumers increasingly turn to organic, locally produced foods, and eggs from hens not kept in cages. In the UK, a survey has found that half of those shown the Fairtrade symbol recognized it and understood that it refers to products that give a better deal for Third World farmers. There is no comparable US research, but related data, and discussions with my own students, suggests that the figure would be much lower. Traders seeking Fairtrade certification must pay producers a price that covers the costs of sustainable production and provides a living wage. For example, the minimum price for coffee is $1.26 per pound, no matter how low the market price may fall. If the market price rises above that figure, the fair trade price will increase so that it remains five cents per pound higher. Small farmers, for their part, are required to be organized in cooperatives or other groups that allow democratic participation. Plantations and factories can use the Fairtrade label if they pay their workers decent wages, comply with health, safety, and environmental standards, allow unions or other forms of workers’ associations, provide good housing if workers are not living at home, and do not use child labor or forced labor. Not every one approves of Fairtrade. Brink Lindsey, director of the pro-market Cato Institute’s Center for Trade Policy Studies, believes that the campaign for Fairtrade coffee is a “well-meaning dead end.” With some justification, he argues that the real cause of the fall in coffee prices was not the profiteering of multinationals, but big increases in coffee production in Brazil and Vietnam, combined with new techniques that make it possible to grow coffee with less labor and hence more cheaply. In Lindsey’s view, if we want to assist coffee growers, we should encourage them either to abandon coffee and produce more profitable crops – and here he rightly points to rich nations’ trade barriers and subsidies as obstacles that must be dismantled – or to move into higher-value products, like specialty coffees, that bring higher prices. What is curious about Lindsey’s argument, however, is that the Fairtrade coffee campaign can be seen as doing just what he recommends – encouraging coffee farmers to produce a specialty coffee that brings a higher price. Pro-market economists don’t object to corporations that blatantly use snob appeal to promote their products. If people want to pay $48 for a pound of Jamaican Blue Mountain coffee because that’s what James Bond prefers, economists don’t object that the market is being distorted. So why be critical when consumers choose to pay $12 for a pound of coffee that they know has been grown without toxic chemicals, under shade trees that help birds to survive, by farmers who can now afford to feed and educate their children? Economists might reply that if you want to help people feed and educate their children, you can pay $10 for a pound of non-Fairtrade coffee that tastes the same and give the $2 you save to an aid agency that provides food and education to poor children. That’s a possible strategy, but there are advantages to Fairtrade. The growers know that they have to provide a product that consumers like, both for its taste and for the way it is grown. If their product sells well, they can take pride in having produced something that is sought after around the world. From the growers’ perspective, receiving a premium by selling a Fairtrade product is preferable to receiving a charitable handout that they would get whether they worked or not and regardless of the quality of what they produce. Paying more for a Fairtrade label is no more “anti-market” than paying more for a Gucci label, and it reflects better ethical priorities. Fairtrade is not a government subsidy. Its success depends on market demand, not political lobbying. Fortunately, in Europe, that market demand is growing rapidly. One hopes that it will soon reach similar levels throughout the developed world, and wherever people can make choices about their discretionary spending.",
            "为何为公平多付钱？ 玛科斯和斯宾塞是一家超级市场和服装连锁店，在英国具有400家分店。 它最近宣布将把它整个咖啡和茶产品总计38条线转到公平贸易。 公平贸易是“符合伦理产品”的市场营销标志。 这家连锁店已经在其200个“咖啡馆复兴”咖啡店中只销售公平贸易的茶和咖啡。 它还大幅增加购买使用公平贸易棉花的衬衣和其他产品。 这一宣布是在“公平贸易双周”期间作出的。 这一双周活动促进公平贸易产品，包括来自发展中国家的农民的演讲，他们告诉英国人公平贸易如何援助了他们的社区。 随着美国的消费者们愈发购买有机的和当地生产的食品以及不是由在笼子里的鸡产下的鸡蛋，这一朝向更为符合伦理消费的运动在那里也取得了重大进展。 在英国，一项调查显示，看到公平贸易标志的人有一半认识这一标志而且知道它指的是能够给第三世界的农民带来更多利益的产品。 在美国并没有类似的研究，但是相关数据以及和我自己的学生们的讨论可以显示这一数字要低很多。 想要公平贸易认证的贸易商必须给生产者支付能够涵盖可持续生产成本并且提供生活必要工资的价格。 例如，无论市场价格如何下跌，咖啡的最低价格都是每磅1.26美元。 如果市场价格高于这一数字，那么，公平贸易的价格也将上升，高于市场价格每磅5分钱。 对于小农场主而言，他们必须以合作社或者其他组织等允许民主参与的形式组织起来。 农业种植园以及工厂如果给工人支付合理的工资、符合医疗、安全以及环境标准、允许工会或者其他形式的工人社团、为不在家居住的工人提供良好的宿舍以及不使用童工或强迫劳工的话，就可以使用公平贸易标志。 并非所有人都赞同公平贸易。 亲市场的卡托贸易政策研究中心主任林德赛认为，为公平贸易咖啡造势是一个“用心良苦的死胡同 ” 。 他不无道理地指出，咖啡价格下跌的真正原因并非是跨国公司的巧取豪夺，而是巴西和越南咖啡产量的激增，加之新技术可以让使用较少的劳力进而更低的价格成为可能。 根据林德赛的观点，如果我们想要援助咖啡种植者，那么我们就应当鼓励他们要么放弃种植咖啡并且生产更为有利可图的作物（他在这一点上正确地指出了富有国家的贸易壁垒以及补贴等障碍必须解除 ） ， 要么转向可以得到更高价格的更高价值的产品，例如特色咖啡。 但是，林德赛主张的奇怪一面是，公平贸易咖啡运动就是在做他所推荐的事情，也就是鼓励咖啡农场主们生产可以带来更高价格的特色咖啡。 亲市场的经济学家们并不反对公司用招摇的手段吸引势利的顾客来对其产品加以促销。 如果人们由于帮德喜欢牙买加蓝山咖啡而愿意花48美元一磅购买的话，经济学家并不因市场受到扭曲而加以反对。 那么，如果消费者们花12美元一磅购买他们知道由现在可以供得起他们的孩子们上学的农民们采用无毒化学品、在让鸟类存活的绿茵树下种植的咖啡时，经济学家们为什么要提出批评呢？ 经济学家们可能会说，如果你想要帮助农民养育他们的孩子并且供他们上学的话，你可以花10美元一磅来购买味道一样的非公平贸易的咖啡并且把你节省下来的2美元交给为贫困儿童提供食品和教育的援助机构。 这一战略是可能的，但是，公平贸易是有利可图的。 种植者们知道，他们必须提供一种为消费者们所喜欢的产品，不仅是味道，而且种植方式也要如此。 如果他们的产品畅销，他们就可以因为提供了一种在全世界热销的产品而自豪。 从种植者的角度而言，通过销售平贸易产品而得到溢价要比无论他们是否工作或者他们的产品质量如何而得到慈善捐助更为可取。 为公平贸易标签支付更多的钱并不比为Gucci品牌多付钱更为“非市场化 ” ， 而且它反映的是更好的伦理取向。 公平贸易并非一种政府补贴。 它的成功取决于市场需求，而非政治游说。 幸运的是，这一市场需求正在欧洲快速增长。 人们希望在所有发达国家以及在人们对他们自主决定的消费中都能够达到相似的水平。"

            "Why “Following the Science” Is Easier Said Than Done NEW YORK – In recent years, and especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, attacks on science and scientists have been escalating to an alarming degree. Health officials and the broader scientific community have pleaded with policymakers and the public to “follow the science.” Yet such slogans fall flat with those who have little regard for scientific authority, not least because science proponents have been using the same blanket term as those who attack it. When we encapsulate all of science within a single word, we implicitly equate it with truth. In fact, many fields of science are still undergoing constant revision. The importance of this distinction became all too clear during the early stages of the pandemic, when health authorities were charged with providing guidance to the public before all the details about the virus were known. Science has always come under attack. From Galileo’s demonstration that the Earth is not at the center of the universe to Darwin’s argument that human beings descended from earlier apes, scientists were long seen as a threat to religious authority and its own claims of true knowledge. One might have thought that modernity would have finally given science a decisive advantage, leading inexorably to more general acceptance of its findings. But a constantly evolving process is not a sure-footed competitor to those trafficking in timeless absolutes. And though it may feel counterintuitive, scientists themselves should resist the popular characterization of science as a body of knowledge. In his 2019 book, The Crisis of Expertise, sociologist Gil Eyal argues that the appeal to “science” and the moral panic about the “assault on science” are beside the point, because not all of “science” is in fact under assault. No one, for example, “disputes quantum mechanics, nor, for that matter, is any solid-state physics discipline under assault.” Indeed, most of science is widely seen as “settled,” whether formally in terms of fundamental theories and understandings, or informally in the sense that most people assume that planes can fly, gravity is real, and hydrogen peroxide can bleach your hair. And yet, while most people trust medical professionals with everything from their annual checkups to their cancer therapies, they also subscribe to a wide range of idiosyncratic notions about health, pharmaceuticals, and medical procedures. What the science journalist Michael Specter calls “denialism” is reflected in a broad array of biomedical issues, from fear of vaccines to belief in the effectiveness of nutritional supplements and, sometimes, miracle cures. Eyal points out that most debates around science concern “what is called ‘regulatory science’ and ‘policy science,’ a collection of sub-disciplines, research programs, and techniques that have in common the need to arrive at a policy recommendation.” These debates tend to reach a fever pitch when there are contentious public-policy issues that are inextricably bound up with ongoing science – as in the case of vaccine mandates, masks, drug approvals, and decarbonization (which entails massive allocations – or reallocations – of resources). In all these cases, the peril arises after the experts have made their views known. When the process moves into realms beyond the purely scientific – legal disputes, public policy, even electoral politics – trouble frequently ensues. If expertise is seen to be associated with one side in legal proceedings, political debates, and cultural questions (such as diet and lifestyle), that perception tends to undermine rather than buttress the authority of science and scientists more generally. The dilemma is that the scientific fields most relevant to policy debates are in a constant state of testing, revision, and debate by scientists themselves. But that is exactly how it should be. As the philosopher John Dewey argued in the early twentieth century, science proceeds not as a single truth or set of truths, but as a method; it is not a body of knowledge, but a process for developing more reliable knowledge. This focus on method is meant to ensure that scientific research and discovery proceeds in a rigorous and transparent fashion. The distilled version of the scientific method taught in grade school hardly captures the wide range of ways that scientists practice their disciplines and test their hypotheses. As important as it is to ensure that science advances methodically, we must also not lose sight of the possibilities opened up by thinking outside the box. Historically, we owe some of the most important scientific discoveries to the imaginative brilliance of visionaries such as Galileo, Darwin, Albert Einstein, James Watson and Francis Crick, and Jennifer Doudna (the 2020 recipient of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for her work on genome editing). Just as good science requires a balance between creativity and method, so, too, building trust in science requires scientists and their public advocates to communicate their findings and processes more effectively. That includes being open about the uncertainties – and serendipities – that are inherent to scientific discovery, and drawing clear distinctions between what is and is not considered settled science. We must accept, and impress upon the public, that science owes its greatest achievements not only to its perpetual expansion into new frontiers, but also to its abiding humility. Otherwise, the public will continue to be disappointed – and disillusioned – by many types of scientific claims.",
            "为何\"遵循科学\"说起来容易做起来难 纽约—近年来，尤其是在新冠大流行期间，对科学和科学家的攻击已升级到令人发指的程度。 卫生官员和更全体科学界恳请政策制定者和公众“遵循科学 ” 。 然而，对于那些不尊重科学权威的人来说，这样的口号完全是隔靴搔痒，尤其是因为科学支持者一直在使用与攻击它的人相同的笼统术语。 如果要用一个词来概括所有科学，那么我们会含蓄地将科学等同于真理。 事实上，许多科学领域仍在不断修正。 在大流行早期阶段，这种区别的重要性显得异常突出，当时卫生当局负责在了解有关病毒的所有细节之前就向公众提供指导。 科学总是受到攻击。 从伽利略证明地球不是宇宙中心到达尔文指出人类是早期猿猴后裔，长期以来，科学家一直被视为对宗教权威及其对真实知识的主张的威胁。 人们可能会认为，现代性最终会给科学带来决定性的优势，无情地带来对科学发现的普遍接受。 但是，一个不断演变的过程绝非贩卖永恒绝对之人的有力对手。 尽管这可能会让人觉得有悖常理，但科学家自己应该抵制将科学描述为知识体系的流行说法。 社会学家吉尔·艾雅尔（Gil Eyal） 在其 2019 年出版的《专业性危机 》 （ The Crisis of Expertise）一书中认为，对“科学”的诉求以及对“攻讦科学”的道德恐慌都没有抓住重点，因为并非所有的“科学”实际上都受到了攻击。 例如，没有人“质疑量子力学，同样，也没有任何固态物理学受到攻击 。 ” 事实上，大多数科学都被广泛认为是“定论 ” ， 无论是正式的基本理论和理解，还是非正式的诸如大多数人认为飞机会飞，重力真实存在，过氧化氢可以漂白你的头发。 然而，虽然大多数人信任医疗专业人员，包括年度体检和癌症治疗，但他们也赞同关于健康、药物和医疗程序的各种无稽之谈。 科学记者迈克尔·斯佩克特（Michael Specter）所说的“否认主义”反映在广泛的生物医学问题上，如对疫苗的恐惧、相信营养补充剂的有效性，有时甚至是奇迹疗法。 艾雅尔指出，围绕科学的大多数辩论都涉及“所谓的‘监管科学’和‘政策科学 ’ ， 这是一系列子学科、研究项目和技术的集合，它们都需要达成政策建议 。 ” 如果存在与正在进行的科学纠缠不清争议性公共政策问题时，这些辩论往往会趋于白热化 — — 例如疫苗授权、口罩、药物批准和脱碳（这需要大规模分配或重新分配资源）等。 在所有这些例子中，危险都是在专家发表意见之后出现的。 当这个过程进入纯科学之外的领域时 — — 法律纠纷、公共政策，甚至选举政治 — — 麻烦往往接踵而至。 如果专业知识被认为与法律诉讼、政治辩论和文化问题（如饮食和生活方式）的一方有关，那么这种感觉往往会削弱而不是更普遍地支持科学和科学家的权威。 困境在于，与政策辩论最相关的科学领域永远处于由科学家自己进行的测试、修正和辩论的状态。 但这正是它应该的样子。 正如哲学家约翰·杜威（John Dewey）在 20 世纪初所指出的那样，科学不是作为一个单一的真理或一组真理进行，而是作为一种方法。 它不是知识体系，而是发展更可靠的知识的过程。 这种对方法的关注旨在确保科学研究和发现以严格和透明的方式进行。 小学所教的提炼后的科学方法本几乎不会提及科学家实践他们的学科、检验他们的假设的各种方法。 确保科学方法进步很重要，同样重要的是也不能忽视通过跳出框框思考所带来的可能性。 从历史上看，一些最重要的科学发现要归功于伽利略、达尔文、爱因斯坦、詹姆斯·沃森和弗朗西斯·克里克，以及詹妮弗·杜德娜（因在基因组方面的工作而获得 2020 年诺贝尔化学奖）等人远见卓识的天才。 正如好科学需要在创造力和方法之间取得平衡，建立对科学的信任也需要科学家及其公共倡导者更有效地交流他们的发现和过程。 这包括对科学发现固有的不确定性和偶然性保持开放态度，明确区分什么是以及什么不是定论的科学。 我们必须接受并向公众留下深刻印象，即科学的最大成就不仅来自它不断向新领域扩展，也来自它持久的谦逊。 否则，公众将继续对各种科学主张感到失望和幻灭。"

            "The Populist War Against Intelligence ATLANTA – Despite his seemingly limitless capacity for vindictiveness, it would be a mistake to interpret US President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw the security clearance of former CIA director John Brennan as only his latest vendetta for lèse-majesté. True, Brennan has all but labeled Trump and his behavior, including his Russian connections, a national security threat. But Trump’s move is more than personal payback. As the most recent blow in his two-year-long attack on the intelligence community, his slap at Brennan is a harbinger of more to come as he tries to bring his espionage agencies to heel. More ominously for the health of the democracies of the West, other populists are following Trump’s example. In Europe, a variety of right-wing parties, having now found themselves in power, are taking on former government antagonists, who have monitored and policed their extremism for decades. In Austria, the country’s populist leaders have been intimidating, muzzling, and purging the country’s intelligence services. In February, on orders from the populist interior minister, Austrian police raided the country’s main intelligence agency – the very organization charged with monitoring right-wing extremism. (It should be recalled that the Freedom Party, the coalition partner in Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz’s government, was founded by ex-SS officers). And what was the pretext for the raid and subsequent demotion of senior Austrian intelligence officials? That the agency was running an operation aimed at harming North Korea. No doubt, Trump wishes that he could pull off such a stunt, and both halt the investigation of him led by Robert Mueller and bring to heel all of the US intelligence agencies. A fan of strongman leaders who “get it done,” Trump admires diktats and brazen contempt for legal processes. He almost certainly will pay even closer attention as the intelligence-fueled investigations into his presidential campaign’s possible collusion with Moscow in 2016 close in on him. It is this combination of self-interest and contempt for law that makes Trump’s revocation of the Brennan’s security clearance so troubling. The regulations governing clearances are straightforward: the president has the power to deny access to official secrets if someone is found to have compromised classified information or is at risk of doing so. By all accounts, Brennan has done nothing of the sort. In fact, Trump admits that. Buried in the explanatory word salad that accompanied the revocation of Brennan’s security clearance, the White House claimed that Brennan’s “erratic” behavior was the cause. That accusation would be laughable if it wasn’t so serious. Trump has simply ignored the laws – including laws governing the US intelligence services – that he swore faithfully to execute. Eleven former CIA directors and deputy directors, as well as 70 former senior CIA officers (including me), said as much last week, criticizing the unprecedented revocation as political coercion and accusing Trump of misusing presidential powers, damaging national security, and threatening current and former officials’ right of free speech. As if to underscore the point, White House spokespeople say that Trump intends to order more revocations, including a former national security adviser and deputy attorney general, as well as former directors of national intelligence, the CIA and the National Security Agency. The hit list is no coincidence. Those in the crosshairs have overseen intelligence collection and analysis that informed the intelligence community’s conclusion that Russia interfered in the 2016 election, including possible collusion with Trump’s presidential campaign. With attacks on the intelligence and law enforcement communities playing well among his supporters, Trump could well double down on this demagoguery. But his willingness to use his presidential powers as a blatantly partisan political weapon breaks ground that no American should want him to tread. The damage that has resulted from the raid in Austria shows why. While Austrian courts ultimately will determine the raid’s legality, the effects are already clear. By stripping Austria’s spies of their files, the raid has essentially put the intelligence service out of operation and raised doubts among allied intelligence services about the Austrians’ reliability. Internal operations are dead in the water, as is intelligence sharing with European counterparts. Washington is not Vienna, but the parallels deserve close attention nonetheless. Trump’s attacks on the intelligence community and its former leaders are unprecedented, and it would be naive not to consider their impact, not only on the current intelligence leadership but also on the rank-and-file officers that do the difficult and often dangerous work of intelligence gathering and analysis. That is why it is so important to adhere to the laws that empower (and constrain) intelligence agencies and that underpin the political independence and integrity of their officers. Events in Austria should be a warning. For democracies to thrive, government must be transparent as well as publicly accountable. When it comes to overseeing intelligence agencies pledged to protect their sources and methods, the challenges are obvious. But so, too, are the threats, including to the democratic process itself, when politicians violate rather than respect the rules that govern their intelligence services’ integrity. In the final analysis, Brennan isn’t the only victim of Trump’s unwarranted and vindictive action. So are all Americans when national leaders put their own interests above those of the country and corrupt the political system they are sworn to defend.",
            "情报民粹主义战争 亚特兰大—尽管美国总统特朗普破坏力无穷，但认为他决定撤销对中央情报局前局长约翰·布雷南（John Brennan）的忠诚调查只是其报复大不敬的最新例子是一个错误。 诚然，布雷南给特朗普和他的行为 — — 包括与俄罗斯的关系 — — 贴上了国家安全威胁的标签。 但特朗普的行动更多的是个人报复。 这是他两年来攻击情报界的最新动作，羞辱布雷南预示着他还会采取更多行动让情报机构屈服。 对西方民主的健康来说，更险恶的迹象是其他民粹主义者正在效仿特朗普的榜样。 在欧洲，众多已经掌权的右翼政党反击几十年来监控和管制他们的极端主义的前政府。 在奥地利，民粹主义领导人一直在恐吓、封口和清洗情报机关。 2月，在民粹主义内政部长的命令下，奥地利警方突击搜查了奥地利主要情报机关 — — 负责监控右翼极端主义的组织。 （有必要回忆一下，奥地利总理库尔茨政府的执政伙伴自由党便是由前SS官员创建。 ） 突击检查和随后对奥地利情报高官的降级的借口是什么？ 该机关正在实施旨在危害朝鲜的行动。 毫无疑问，特朗普也想着自己能够完成这样的“壮举 ” ， 既中止罗伯特·穆勒（Robert Mueller）领衔的对他的调查，又让美国情报机关屈服于自己。 作为一个“搞定它”的强人领袖的崇拜者，特朗普渴望绝对权威，无耻地无视法律程序。 他几乎肯定会更加关注此事，因为情报导致他遭到对其2016年竞选活动与莫斯科的可能的勾结的调查，令他十分难堪。 这一自利和蔑视法律的组合让特朗普撤销布雷南的忠诚调查的决定变得很有问题。 关于忠诚调查的规定非常直白：如果某人被发现曾经泄露机密信息或有可能这样做，总统有权取消他接触官方机密的权利。 不管从哪个角度看，布雷南都没有做过这种事。 事实上，特朗普也承认这一点。 撤销布雷南忠诚调查的决定带来了无数风言风语，遭到口诛笔伐的白宫宣称这是布雷南的“古怪”行为导致的。 这简直贻笑大方。 特朗普根本无视他宣誓效忠的法律 — — 包括管理美国情报机构的法律。 十一位中央情报局前局长和副局长，以及70 为中央情报局前高级官员（包括我 ） ， 在上周都发声批评这一前所未有的撤销忠诚调查的行为属于政治压迫，并指责特朗普滥用总统权力，危害国家安全，威胁现任和前任官员的言论自由。 好像觉得这还不够分量，白宫发言人表示特朗普准备下达更多撤销令，包括一位前国家安全顾问和司法部副部长，以及中央情报局和国家安全局等情报机关的前主管。 这份打击名单绝非巧合。 其对准的目标所负责的情报收集和分析工作让情报机关认定俄罗斯干预了2016年总统竞选，并且可能与特朗普的竞选活动勾结。 特朗普的支持者很吃特朗普攻击情报和执法部门这一套，因此特朗普很可能会变本加厉散播谣言。 但他将总统权力赤裸裸地用于政治党争越过了没有一个美国人认为他可以跨越的边界。 奥地利突袭情报机关所带来的后果说明了原因。 尽管突袭合法性需要法院来裁定，但其后果已经显而易见。 突袭卷走了奥地利间谍的档案，让情报机关行动陷入了瘫痪，也让盟友情报机关质疑奥地利的可靠性。 内部运行一潭死水，与欧洲情报机关的情报共享亦然。 华盛顿不是维也纳，但相似性仍然值得密切注意。 特朗普对情报机关及其前领导人的攻击是前所未有的，不考虑其影响 — — 不仅仅是对现任情报领导人，也包括从事艰苦的、常常也很危险的情报搜集和分析工作的普通工作者 — — 将失之天真。 因此，必须遵守法律并赋权（和约束）情报机关，支持情报官员的政治独立性和诚信。 奥地利发生的事情应该成为警示。 民主要想繁荣，政府就必须透明并接受公众问责。 对于承诺保护信息源和手段的情报机构的监管工作，挑战是显而易见的。 但威胁也是显而易见的，如果政客违反而不是尊重管理情报机构诚信问题的规则，民主程序本身也将受到威胁。 在最后的分析中，布雷南不是特朗普子虚乌有的报复行动的唯一受害者。 当国家领导人将个人利益置于国家利益之上、侵蚀他们宣誓要捍卫的政治制度时，全体美国人都是受害者。"

            "Wrong on the Dollar – for Now NEW HAVEN – I should have listened to Alan Greenspan – at least when it comes to currency forecasting. The former chair of the Federal Reserve once told me it was a fool’s game, with the odds of getting currency calls right worse than a successful bet on a coin toss. Two years ago, I ignored the maestro’s advice and went out on a limb, predicting that the US dollar would crash by 35%. After a tantalizing 9% decline in the second half of 2020, the broad dollar index – the real effective exchange rate as calculated by the Bank for International Settlements – has gone the other way, soaring by 12.3% from January 2021 through May 2022. That puts the dollar 2.3% above its level in May 2020, around the time I made this seemingly foolish call. How did I get it so wrong? Three factors shaped my thinking: America’s current-account deficit, Federal Reserve policy, and TINA (“there is no alternative”). I argued that the external deficit was headed for big trouble and that a passive Fed would do little to arrest the problem – effectively forcing the bulk of the current-account adjustment to be concentrated in a weakening currency rather than in rising interest rates. I also took a swipe at the TINA defense of the dollar and tried to make the case for euro and renminbi appreciation. Basically, the Fed saved the dollar – aided and abetted by Russian President Vladimir Putin. The US current-account deficit, the crux of my fundamental case against the dollar, has in fact deteriorated dramatically over the past two years. The broadest measure of America’s international balance went from -2% of GDP in the first quarter of 2020 to -4.8% in the first quarter of 2022, with the just-reported data for early 2022 revealing the second-sharpest quarterly deterioration since 1960. America’s current-account deficit hasn’t been this large since mid-2008 in the depths of the global financial crisis. My dollar-crash narrative hinged importantly on the possibility of an increasingly unstable post-pandemic current-account dynamic, with outsize federal budget deficits leading to a sharp compression of already-depressed domestic saving. The theory – actually, the national income-accounting identity – stresses that saving-short economies must import surplus saving in order to keep growing, and then run large current-account deficits in order to attract the foreign capital. In the face of exploding budget deficits, the theory worked as expected: the net domestic saving rate plunged to zero in the middle two quarters of 2020. Surprisingly, domestic saving has since rebounded, with the net national saving rate averaging 3.25% in 2021 and moving up further to 4.2% in early 2022. Over the post-pandemic period starting in the second quarter of 2020, however, the net domestic saving rate has averaged just 2.6% of national income, a dramatic shortfall from the longer-term 45-year average of 7% from 1960 to 2005. This matches up reasonably well with the sharp recent widening of the US current-account deficit. History demonstrates that sharply deteriorating current-account balances are not a sustainable outcome for countries lacking domestic saving. Foreign creditors will demand concessions for lending their surpluses: higher returns (interest rates), cheaper financing (the currency conversion), or both. If one option is closed off, then the other channel bears the brunt of the current-account adjustment. This is where the Fed saved the dollar. It certainly didn’t seem that way in 2020 and early 2021. During that period, the Fed was steadfast in maintaining its overly accommodative policy stance, even in the face of an emerging inflationary shock that it initially misdiagnosed as “transitory.” I viewed this intransigence as good reason to believe that interest rates would remain uncomfortably low. As a result, the US current-account adjustment would be increasingly concentrated in the sharp depreciation of an overvalued dollar. My call for a 35% correction in the dollar was in line with the 30% average of three earlier large cyclical drops that had occurred in the 1970s, 1980s, and in the early 2000s. When the Fed belatedly pivoted in late 2021, I should have done the same thing with my dollar call. Forward-looking financial markets correctly sensed that something had to give and moved well in anticipation of the Fed’s about-face; roughly half of the dollar’s 12.3% appreciation since January 2021 occurred prior to the Fed’s conversion the following December. Putin’s saber-rattling and subsequent military aggression in Ukraine added a significant safe-haven bid to the dollar. The euro and even the renminbi fell, instead of rising, as I had predicted, and the Japanese yen collapsed, as the Bank of Japan was more than willing to accommodate an inflation surprise as an antidote to its third “lost decade.” There are plenty of lessons to take from this episode. First, and most obviously, don’t fight the Fed. The US central bank ultimately did the right thing; it has plenty more to do but now seems more willing to do it. Second, financial markets could not care less about theory. US monetary tightening is viewed less as a current-account funding concession by a saving-short US economy and more as a desperate effort to catch up with the yield curve. Third, the dollar’s exorbitant privilege as the world’s reserve currency is never clearer than during times of war. With the world in turmoil thanks to Putin, TINA is more seductive than ever. Ultimately, of course, it all boils down to how much of this has already been discounted by forward-looking financial markets. I suspect that the Fed’s call and the TINA factor are already in the price of an overvalued dollar. I do not believe the same can be said about the dire US balance-of-payments prognosis. I know – that’s what I said two years ago.",
            "论错美元 - - 现在 纽黑文—我应该听艾伦·格林斯潘（Alan Greenspan）的 — — 至少在货币预测方面是这样。 这位美联储前主席曾经告诉我，这是一场傻瓜游戏，正确预测货币的几率比掷硬币的下注还要糟糕。 两年前，我无视大师的建议，孤注一掷，预测美元将暴跌 35 % 。 在 2020 年下半年大幅下跌 9% 之后，广义美元指数（由国际清算银行计算的实际有效汇率）反其道而行之，从 2021 年 1 月到 2022 年 5 月飙升了 12.3 % 。 这使美元比 2020 年 5 月的水平高出 2.3 % ， 这时我做出这个看上去愚蠢无比的决定。 我怎么弄错了？ 三个因素塑造了我的想法：美国的经常账户赤字、美联储政策，以及 TINA （ “ 别无选择 ” ） 。 我认为，外部赤字正走向大麻烦，二消极的美联储对解决这个问题几乎无能为力 — — 迫使大部分经常账户调整集中在货币贬值而不是利率上升上。 我还抨击了 挺美元的TINA论，试图为欧元和人民币升值提供理由。 基本上，美联储在俄罗斯总统普京的帮助和怂恿下拯救了美元。 美国经常账户赤字是我对美元的基本观点的题眼，事实上，它在过去两年中急剧恶化。 衡量美国国际收支平衡的最广泛指标从 2020 年第一季度占 GDP 的-2% 到 2022 年第一季度的-4.8 % ， 刚刚公布的 2022 年初数据更是曝出 1960 年以来第二严重的季度恶化。 自 2008 年年中全球金融危机高峰以来，美国的经常账户赤字从未如此之大。 我的美元崩溃论主要取决于大流行后经常账户动态越来越不稳定的可能性。 庞大的联邦预算赤字导致本已低迷的国内储蓄急剧压缩。 该理论 — — 实际上是国民收入恒等式 — — 强调储蓄短缺的经济体必须输入盈余储蓄以保持增长，然后出现巨额经常账户赤字以吸引外国资本。 面对爆炸式的预算赤字，该理论如预期般奏效：2020 年中期两个季度，国内净储蓄率暴跌至零。 令人惊讶的是，此后国内储蓄出现反弹，2021 年国民净储蓄率平均为 3.25 % ， 并在 2022 年初进一步上升至 4.2 % 。 然而，在从 2020 年第二季度开始的大流行后时期，净国内储蓄利率平均仅为国民收入的 2.6 % ， 与 1960 年至 2005 年 7% 的45 年长期平均水平相去甚远。 这与美国经常账户赤字最近急剧扩大的情况相当吻合。 历史表明，急剧恶化的经常账户余额对于缺乏国内储蓄的国家来说不是一个可持续的结果。 外国债权人将要求为借出盈余做出让步：更高的回报（利率 ） ， 更便宜的融资（货币兑换 ） ， 或两者都要。 如果一个选项被关闭，那么另一个渠道将首当其冲受到经常账户调整的影响。 这就是美联储拯救之处。 在 2020 年和 2021 年初，情况显然并非如此。 在此期间，美联储坚定地维持其过度宽松的政策立场，即使面对最初被误诊为“暂时性”的新兴通胀冲击也是如此。 我认为这种不妥协的态度是相信利率将保持在令人不安的低水平的充分理由。 因此，美国经常项目调整将越来越集中在被高估的美元的大幅贬值上。 我对美元回调 35% 的定论与 1970 年代、1980 年代和 2000 年代初发生的三次较早的周期性大幅下跌的 30% 平均值一致。 当美联储在 2021 年末终于转向的时候，我应该对美元预测做同样的事情。 前瞻的金融市场正确地感觉到必须做出一些让步，并很好地预期美联储了转变； 2021 年 1 月以来美元 12.3% 的升值幅度中约有一半发生在随后的 12 月美联储转换政策之前。 普京对乌克兰的武力攻击和随后的军事侵略为美元增加了重要的避险买盘。 欧元甚至人民币都有所下跌，而不是像我预测的那样上涨，日元崩盘，因为日本银行更愿意接受通胀意外作为其第三个“失去的十年”的解毒剂。 这次经历可以吸取很多教训。 首先，也是最明显的，不要与美联储对抗。 美国央行最终做了正确的事；它还有很多事情要做，但现在似乎更愿意这样做。 其次，金融市场不能忽视理论。 美国收紧货币政策与其说是储蓄短缺的美国经济对经常项目融资的让步，不如说是为了赶上收益率曲线而拼命努力。 第三，美元作为世界储备货币的嚣张的特权从未像战争时期那样清晰。 由于普京的缘故，世界陷入了动荡，TINA比以往任何时候都更具诱惑力。 当然，归根结底，这一切都归结为前瞻的金融市场已经贴现了多少。 我怀疑美联储的政策和 TINA 因素已经体现在美元被高估的价格中。 我认为可怕的美国收支余额的结果不适用这一点。 我知道 — — 这就是我两年前所说的。"

            "Why Punish Corporations for Their Employees’ Crimes? LONDON – Under English common law from the eleventh century until 1846, an inanimate object or an animal that caused a person’s death would be forfeited, becoming what was referred to as a “deodand.” Thus, when William Swan fell into a well and drowned in Wigston, England in 1397, the coroner ordered the destruction of the well. Likewise, chattels that caused a person’s death were given to God or to his representative on Earth, the monarch. Such deodands also were offered up to the relevant authorities in colonial America. When George Bollington died from falling off a horse in Virginia in 1664, the horse was forfeited to the governor. And as William Bradford recounts in Of Plymouth Plantation, when the colonist Thomas Granger was executed for bestiality in 1642, the farm animals that he had abused were sacrificed alongside him. From today’s perspective, punishing inanimate objects and animals for criminal acts that they do not have the agency to have committed seems absurd. Yet what is one to make of Goldman Sachs’ recent settlement with the US Department of Justice, whereby it will pay a $2.8 billion fine for its work – including aiding in the embezzlement of billions of dollars – with the corrupt Malaysian government fund 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB)? If one views criminal culpability as a matter involving individual human beings, it seems odd that an inanimate legal construct – a corporation – could be the one found guilty of committing a crime. In the late eighteenth century, the British jurist Sir William Blackstone observed that, “A corporation cannot commit treason, or felony, or other crime.” Yet by the early twentieth century, firms had come to be held liable for their employees’ criminal as well as civil misdeeds. Because this didn’t change the fact that a corporation can neither form criminal intent nor bear the burden of a punishment, it meant that punishment would be borne mainly by stockholders and employees. This suffering inflicted on innocent parties was by design, rather than by accident, as in cases where a criminal’s family suffers as a result of his punishment. In addition to recognizing that modern corporations have become a deodand for punishing malfeasance, Albert Alschuler of the University of Chicago Law School argues that corporations also can be viewed as a type of “frankpledge.” In Anglo-Saxon England, a frankpledge was a collection of men who were “bound together and held responsible for delivering anyone in any of their ten households who had committed a crime. If the criminal escaped, all ten members of the tithing were fined.” Punishing corporations for the bad behavior of individual employees might be viewed as a variant of this mechanism, insofar as it creates an incentive for employees and stockholders to monitor employee behavior. But a frankpledge involves a trade-off between efficiency and justice. Should we really punish whole groups for criminal actions carried out by individuals? And should we really expect such a regime to lead to more monitoring and accountability, rather than a kind of moral hazard whereby members conclude that they might as well misbehave if they could be punished anyway? If an employee believes that she might be subpoenaed, she may be less apt to record phone calls and save emails. True, indirectly punishing criminal employees by punishing the corporation might make sense in cases where justice is handed down immediately. But all too often, the guilty individuals are long gone by the time any punishment is levied. Similarly, requiring employees and shareholders to compensate for the damage caused by a crime that they did not commit but have benefited from also could make sense, but only if the fine is transparently related to the perceived benefit. Some would argue that it is reasonable to fine a corporation because an individual employee who is responsible for wrongdoing is unable or cannot be forced to make restitution. But the fact that the guilty party cannot pay hardly justifies forcing others to do so instead. At the end of the financial crisis that began in 2008, US authorities fined banks a total of $243 billion, all as punishments for crimes committed by employees. Between 2008 and 2018, only one top banker was sentenced in the United States for his role in the financial crisis. The fact that two Goldman Sachs bankers have been charged in the 1MDB case is an exception that proves the rule. (One has pled guilty and awaits sentencing; the other has pled not guilty and awaits trial.) Why do policymakers and the justice system prefer to impose criminal penalties on abstract legal constructs instead of going after those who actually committed the crimes? One answer might be that this approach gives regulators more power over the entities they regulate. Another is that prosecutors only bring cases they can win, and it is simply easier to go after the whole corporation than it is to prove who bears responsibility for which misdeeds. Jurors, too, probably find it easier to pronounce abstract entities guilty than to condemn a person to prison or a loss of livelihood. Obviously, it takes corporate employees to commit corporate crimes. But as long as they collude, no one goes to jail.",
            "为何员工犯罪要惩罚公司？ 伦敦—在十一世纪直到1846年的英国普通法中，非生物体或动物如造成人的死亡，将遭到处刑，即所谓的“赎罪奉献 ” 。 因此，1397年，威廉·思旺（William Swan）在英格兰威格斯顿（Wigston）坠井溺亡，验尸官下令将井毁坏。 类似地，导致人死亡的动产也会交给上帝或他在人间的代理君主处理。 这些赎罪奉献也被提供给殖民地美洲的相关当局。 1664年，乔治·波林顿（George Bollington）在弗吉尼亚州坠马身亡，当事马匹被移交给州长。 威廉·布拉德福德（William Bradford）在《普利茅斯拓荒记 》 （ Of Plymouth Plantation）中记载，殖民者托马斯·格兰杰（Thomas Granger）在1642年因兽交而被处决，被他虐待的农场动物也随其殉葬。 从今天的角度看，因非生命物体和动物无从犯下的罪行而惩罚他们实属荒谬。 但如果是高盛公司最近与美国司法部的和解的原因呢？ 高盛公司与腐败的马来西亚政府基金1Malaysia Development Bhd有染，其罪名包括协助侵占数十亿美元公款，高盛将为此支付28亿美元罚款。 如果你将刑事过失视为个体人有关的问题，那么非生物体的法律主体 — — 公司 — — 因为犯罪而被定罪就会显得十分奇怪。 在十八世纪晚期，英国法官威廉·布莱克斯通爵士（Sir William Blackstone）观察道 ， “ 公司无法犯下叛国、重邢或其他犯罪 。 ” 但在二十世纪初，企业因为员工犯罪和民事违法行为而担负法律责任。 因为这并没有改变公司既不构成犯罪意图又不能承担惩罚的事实，所以这意味着惩罚主要由股东和员工承担。 这一施加于无辜方的损失属于刻意而非偶然，一如罪犯家人因为罪犯所受惩罚而受到的损失。 除了认识到现代公司已经成为惩罚渎职的赎罪奉献，芝加哥大学法学院的阿尔伯特·奥尔舒勒（Albert Alschuler）指出，公司也可以视为一种“十户联保 ” 。 在盎格鲁-萨克逊英格兰，十户联保是指一群男子，他们“有紧密联系，十户人家任何一人犯罪，其余连坐。 如果罪犯逃脱，十户人家都会受罚 。 ” 因个别员工的劣行而惩罚公司可被视为这一机制的一个变体，因为它创造了员工和股东监督员工行为的激励。 但十户联保也意味着效率和正义的权衡。 我们真的应该因为个体所犯罪行而惩罚整个组织吗？ 我们真的应该期待这一机制带来更多的监督和问责，而不会引发某种道德风险，即成员认为，既然无论如何都会受到惩罚，不如为所欲为好了？ 如果员工认为她可能收到传票，它可能就不回去记录电话和保存电子邮件了。 诚然，通过惩罚公司来间接惩罚犯罪员工对于正义立即降临的案件可能是有意义的。 但经常发生的情况是，有罪个人在惩罚做出的时候早已走人。 类似地，要求员工和股东补偿他们并未犯下，但却从中获益的罪行所造成的伤害也未必没有意义，但罚款必须明显与感到的收益挂钩。 有人会说，因为需要对罪行负责的个体员工无法或不可能强制赔偿，所以惩罚公司是合理的。 但有罪方不可能赔偿这一事实并不能证明应该让其他人赔偿。 始于2008年的金融危机结束时，美国当局对银行课以总数2430亿美元的罚款，这完全是对员工所犯罪行的惩罚。 2008—2018年间，只有一名顶尖银行家因为在金融危机中的作为而在美国被判刑。 在1MDB案中被起诉的两位高盛银行家只是证实规则存在的例外。 （其中一位认罪并在等候服刑；另一位不认罪，在等待审判。 ） 决策者和司法体系为何偏好于对抽象法律主体施加刑事惩罚，而不去追拿真正犯罪的人？ 一个答案可能是，这一方法让监管者拥有对监管对象的更大的权力。 另一个回答是检方只办能赢的案子，咬住整家公司显然比证明谁要为不当行为负责容易的多。 陪审员也可能认为宣布抽象实体有罪要比将人送进监狱或丧失生计更容易。 显然，公司犯罪肯定是公司员工干的。 但只要互相勾结，谁也不会进监狱。"

            "Why Putin Makes a Bad Ally STANFORD – Russian President Vladimir Putin’s intervention in the Syrian conflict has been welcomed by some as a moment for the Kremlin to “come in from the cold.” Russia’s conflict with the Islamic State, the argument goes, has aligned the country’s interests with those of the West. Even Turkey’s downing of a Russian warplane does not seem not to have deflated this optimism. Indeed, at a recent press conference, US President Barack Obama again urged Putin to join the alliance against the Islamic State. And French President François Hollande billed his recent visit to Moscow as an effort to build a broad international coalition against the terrorist group. At first blush, the idea that Russia is a natural ally against Islamist terrorists seems to make sense. The country has suffered horrific terrorist attacks by Islamist extremists, including the bombing in November of a plane above the Sinai Peninsula, which killed 224 passengers and crew, nearly all of them Russian. Around 20 million Muslims, most of them Sunni, live within the Russian Federation, and the country’s security officials report that some 7,000 fighters from the former Soviet republics and Russia have joined the Islamic State. On deeper examination, however, it becomes clear that an anti-terror alliance with Russia is wishful thinking. Putin has not gone into Syria to defeat the Islamic State. He has intervened to save the regime of Russia’s client, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Putin may sometimes give the appearance that he is ready to abandon Assad, but ultimately he will defend him. Leaving Assad to his fate would be a sign of weakness – and thus anathema to Putin. Ordinary Russians may be in danger of attacks by Islamic extremists, but they pose little threat to Putin or his allies. Russia has indeed suffered a number of terrorist attacks, including the 2004 Beslan massacre, in which 334 people, most of them schoolchildren, were killed. In nearly every case, the response to the attacks was brutal, inept, and costly in terms of civilian lives lost. And yet the Putin regime has emerged unscathed each time. Indeed, terrorist attacks at the turn of the century solidified public opinion against Chechen rebels and gave Putin the public support he needed to raze Grozny, Chechnya’s capital. Putin’s confidence in dealing with terrorism reflects the design of Russia’s security state. Russia spends more on internal security than it does on national defense. It has interior ministry troops, federal security agency (FSB) special forces, OMON (mobile special service) troops, military intelligence troops, and a vast network of internal spies and informants. Regime opponents are not allowed to run for office, their rights to demonstrate are restricted, and they are subject to a legal arbitrariness in the courts. Citizens have virtually no protection from wiretaps or the interception of their electronic communications. Every society must balance civil rights against national security. Putin’s Russia has swung to one extreme of the spectrum, while the United States and Europe (despite the protests of civil libertarians) have chosen to occupy the other end. Indeed, Russia is an example of the upper limit of what state power can do to control terrorist activity. It would be a rare extremist group that had not been infiltrated with an informant who reports to Moscow. There is even evidence that those who carried out the Beslan massacre were infiltrated by Russian intelligence. Moreover, any terrorist group knows that their operations will be met with the most extreme use of force. In Beslan, for example, Russian special forces used thermobaric weapons. As the reaction to the attacks in Paris illustrates, the seemingly random murder of 130 civilians has monumental resonance in the West – especially when the religious and ideological motives are difficult to understand. But the Kremlin places a lower value on human lives than Western societies do. In Putin’s calculations, the loss of lives in extremist attacks is unwelcome, but ultimately acceptable if it does not threaten the regime. The Russian people might be horrified and frightened. But the Russian regime is primarily concerned with its own survival – and with how it might use the public’s horror to its benefit. Working with the West to combat the Islamic State serves neither of those purposes.",
            "普京为什么是糟糕的盟友 斯坦福 — — 俄罗斯总统弗拉基米尔·普京对叙利亚冲突的干预一直深受某些人的欢迎，认为这是克里姆林宫“摆脱孤立”的时刻。 这种观点认为俄罗斯与伊斯兰国的冲突已经把俄罗斯的利益绑在了西方的战车上。 就连土耳其击落俄罗斯战机似乎也没有让这种乐观情绪受到影响。 事实上，在最近一次新闻发布会上，美国总统奥巴马再次敦促普京加入反对伊斯兰国的联盟。 而法国总统奥朗德则将不久前对莫斯科的访问标榜为试图建立反对恐怖组织的广泛的国际联盟。 乍一看，俄罗斯是打击伊斯兰恐怖分子天然盟友的说法似乎颇有道理。 该国遭受过伊斯兰极端分子可怕的恐怖主义袭击，其中包括十一月西奈半岛上空发生的飞机爆炸，造成224名乘客和机组人员死亡，几乎所有人都是俄罗斯公民。 约有2，000万穆斯林，多数是逊尼派，在俄罗斯联邦境内生活，据该国安全官员报告，来自前苏联加盟共和国和俄罗斯的大约7，000名武装人员已经加入了伊斯兰国。 但只要深入分析形势，就会明白与俄罗斯建立反恐联盟不过是一厢情愿的想法。 普京进入叙利亚不是为击败伊斯兰国。 他的介入是为挽救俄国的附庸政权，叙利亚总统巴沙尔·阿萨德。 普京有时可能看似做好了放弃阿萨德的准备，但最终他会保护阿萨德。 让阿萨德听任命运的安排将是一种软弱的表现 — — 因此对普京来讲根本无法接受。 普通俄国人可能会受到伊斯兰极端分子的袭击，但他们对普京及其盟友构不成太大的威胁。 俄罗斯实际上的确遭遇了若干次恐怖袭击，包括2004年的别斯兰惨案，造成334人，多数是学生死亡。 几乎在所有情况下，对袭击采取的反制措施都残酷、无能，让民众付出了惨重的生命代价。 但每次普京政权却都能安然渡过、毫发无伤。 事实上，发生在世纪之交的恐怖袭击巩固了反对车臣叛军的公众舆论，并赋予了普京夷平车臣首都格罗兹尼所需的公众支持。 普京应对恐怖主义的信心反映了俄罗斯的安全国家设计。 俄国在国内安全上的开支甚至超过国家防御。 它组建了内政部部队、联邦安全局（FSB）特种部队，内政部特种（机动特服）部队、军事情报部队和由国内间谍和线人组成的庞大网络。 政权反对者不得竞选公职，他们的示威权利受到限制，并在法庭面对法律强制。 公民的谈话遭到监听，他们的电子邮件遭到拦截。 所有社会都必须平衡国家安全和公民权利。 普京的俄罗斯走到了其中一个极端，而美国和欧洲（尽管不时发生公民自由抗议活动）则选择了相反的一头。 事实上，俄罗斯代表了国家政权控制恐怖活动所能达到的上限。 鲜有极端主义团体从未被向莫斯科汇报的线人渗透。 甚至有证据表明别斯兰惨案的制造者也已遭到俄罗斯情报部门的渗透。 此外，任何恐怖组织都知道他们的行动将遭到极端的武力镇压。 比方说在别斯兰，俄罗斯特种部队就使用燃料空气弹作为武器。 对巴黎袭击事件的反应说明，貌似随意的130名平民屠杀事件却在西方掀起了巨大的波澜 — — 尤其当宗教和意识形态动机很难理解的时候。 但克里姆林宫不像西方社会那样珍视人的生命。 在普京看来，极端分子袭击造成人员伤亡令人不快，但如果不威胁政权那么最终可以接受。 俄罗斯民众可能感到非常惊恐。 但俄罗斯政权主要关心其自身的生存 — — 以及如何利用公众恐惧为自己谋求好处。 与西方合作打击伊斯兰国不符合他们的目标。"

            "Hard to be Easing NEW YORK – The United States Federal Reserve’s decision to undertake a third round of quantitative easing, or QE3, has raised three important questions. Will QE3 jump-start America’s anemic economic growth? Will it lead to a persistent increase in risky assets, especially in US and other global equity markets? Finally, will its effects on GDP growth and equity markets be similar or different? Many now argue that QE3’s effect on risky assets should be as powerful, if not more so, than that of QE1, QE2, and “Operation Twist,” the Fed’s earlier bond-purchase program. After all, while the previous rounds of US monetary easing have been associated with a persistent increase in equity prices, the size and duration of QE3 are more substantial. But, despite the Fed’s impressive commitment to aggressive monetary easing, its effects on the real economy and on US equities could well be smaller and more fleeting than those of previous QE rounds. Consider, first, that the previous QE rounds came at times of much lower equity valuations and earnings. In March 2009, the S&P 500 index was down to 660, earnings per share (EPS) of US companies and banks had sunk to a financial-crisis low, and price/earnings ratios were in the single digits. Today, the S&P 500 is more than 100% higher (hovering near 1,430), the average EPS is close to $100, and P/E ratios are above 14. Even during QE2, in the summer of 2010, the S&P 500, P/E ratios, and EPS were much lower than they are today. If, as is likely, economic growth in the US remains anemic in spite of QE3, top-line revenues and bottom-line earnings will turn south, with negative effects on equity valuations. Moreover, fiscal support is absent this time: QE1 and QE2 helped to prevent a deeper recession and avoid a double dip, respectively, because each was associated with a significant fiscal stimulus. In contrast, QE3 will be associated with a fiscal contraction, possibly even a large fiscal cliff. Even if the US avoids the full fiscal cliff of 4.5% of GDP that is looming at the end of the year, it is highly likely that a fiscal drag amounting to 1.5% of GDP will hit the economy in 2013. With the US economy currently growing at a 1.6% annual rate, a fiscal drag of even 1% implies near-stagnation in 2013, though a modest recovery in housing and manufacturing, together with QE3, should keep US growth at about its current level in 2013. But there is no broader rebound underway. In both 2010 and 2011, leading economic indicators showed that the first-half slowdown had bottomed out, and that growth was already accelerating before the announcement of monetary easing. Thus, QE nudged along an economy that was already recovering, which prolonged asset reflation. By contrast, the latest data suggest that the US economy is performing as sluggishly now as it was in the first half of the year. Indeed, if anything, weakness in the US labor market, low capital expenditures, and slow income growth have contradicted signals in the early summer that third-quarter growth might be more robust. Meanwhile, the main transmission channels of monetary stimulus to the real economy – the bond, credit, currency, and stock markets – remain weak, if not broken. Indeed, the bond-market channel is unlikely to boost growth. Long-term government bond yields are already very low, and a further reduction will not significantly change private agents’ borrowing costs. The credit channel also is not working properly, as banks have hoarded most of the extra liquidity from QE, creating excess reserves rather than increasing lending. Those who can borrow have ample cash and are cautious about spending, while those who want to borrow – highly indebted households and firms (especially small and medium-size enterprises) – face a credit crunch. The currency channel is similarly impaired. With global growth weakening, net exports are unlikely to improve robustly, even with a weaker dollar. Moreover, many major central banks are implementing variants of QE alongside the Fed, dampening the effect of the Fed’s actions on the dollar’s value. Perhaps most important, a weaker dollar’s effect on the trade balance, and thus on growth, is limited by two factors. First, a weaker dollar is associated with a higher dollar price for commodities, which implies a drag on the trade balance, because the US is a net commodity-importing country. Second, any improvement in GDP derived from stronger exports leads to an increase in imports. Empirical studies estimate that the overall impact of a weaker US dollar on the trade balance is close to zero. The only other significant channel to transmit QE to the real economy is the wealth effect of an equity-market increase, but there is some circularity in the argument that QE3 will lead to a persistent rise in equity prices. If persistent asset reflation requires a significant GDP growth recovery, it is tautological to say that if equity prices rise enough following QE, the resulting increase in GDP from a wealth effect justifies the rise in asset prices. If monetary policy’s transmission channels to the real economy are broken, one cannot assume that QE will have a significant effect on economic growth. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke has recently emphasized the importance of an additional channel: the confidence channel, through which the Fed’s commitment to maintaining generous monetary conditions for longer could improve private spending. The issue is how substantial and durable such effects will be. Confidence is fragile in an environment characterized by ongoing deleveraging, macro uncertainties, weak labor-market growth, and a fiscal drag. In short, QE3 reduces the tail risk of an outright economic contraction, but is unlikely to lead to a sustained recovery in an economy that is still enduring a painful deleveraging process. In the short run, QE3 will lead investors to take on risk, and will stimulate modest asset reflation. But the equity-price rise is likely to fizzle out over time if economic growth disappoints, as is likely, and drags down expectations about corporate revenues and profitability.",
            "难以宽松 发自纽约 — — 美联储实施第三轮量化宽松（QE3）的决定引出了三大重要问题：QE3能否紧急启动美国当前乏力的经济增长？ 它是否会导致风险资产的持续增长，尤其是在美国以及其他全球股票市场？ 最后，其对GDP增长和股票市场的影响将会相似还是有所不同？ 许多人如今认为QE3对风险资产的影响应该与第一轮（QE1 ） ， 第二轮量化宽松（QE2）以及美联储早前的债券购买计划“扭曲操作（Operation Twist ） ” 具备同样威力（如果不是更大的话 ） 。 毕竟以股票价格计算的话，QE3的规模和持续时间都更具实质性。 但尽管美联储实施积极货币宽松的许诺非常引人注目，但此举对实体经济和美股的影响可能比前两轮的都要更小也更短暂。 首先，考虑到以往的宽松政策都是在股票估值和收益都更加低的时候推出。 在2009年3月，标准普尔500指数下跌到660点，美国企业和银行的每股收益率都降到了危机以来的最低点，市盈率降到了单数。 如今，标准普尔500指数已经翻了超过一番（接近1430点 ） ， 平均每股收益率约有100美元，市盈率超过了14。 即便是2010年夏的QE2期间，标普500指数，市盈率和每股收益率都比今天要低得多。 倘若（而且很可能）美国的经济增长在QE3之下依然疲软，营业收入和实际利润将下降，并对股票估值也会产生负面的影响。 此外，本次宽松也缺乏财政支持：QE1和QE2分别防止了陷入更严重衰退并阻以及二次下滑，因为每次宽松都是与一个大型财政刺激计划联系在一起的。 相比之下，QE3将会与一轮财政收紧联系在一起，甚至很可能是一场财政大幅削减。 即便美国避免了可能在今年年末出现的相当于GDP4.5%的全面财政削减，也很有可能会有一场相当于GDP1.5%的财政拖累来对2013年的经济造成打击。 美国经济目前的年均增长为1.6 % ， 即便住宅和制造业都已经出现温和复苏，加上QE3，都能将美国2013年的增长保持在这一水平，但即便是1%的财政拖累都将意味着经济增长会在2013年近乎停滞。 但目前没有更大范围的反弹出现。 在2010和2011年，一些前导经济指数显示上半年的经济放缓已经触底反弹，且增长在货币宽松宣布之前就已经开始加速。 因此当时宽松助推了一个已经开始复苏的经济，并因此延长了资产的再膨胀。 相比之下，最近的数据显示美国当前的经济表现正如上半年一样步履维艰。 事实上，更可能表现出来的是，美国劳动力市场的疲软，低资本支出以及缓慢的收入增长都反映出第三季度是不可能出现更强劲增长的。 与此同时，货币刺激向实体经济传导的主要渠道 — — 债券，信贷，货币和股票市场 — — 都依然疲软 — — 如果不是千疮白孔的话。 事实上，债券市场渠道不太可能去刺激增长。 长期政府债券收益已经非常低下，即便进一步下调，也不会对私人机构的借贷成本产生太大影响。 而信贷渠道同样不甚通畅，因为银行已经囤积了来自量化宽松的大部分额外流动性，不但没有增加贷款，反而还产生了多余的储备。 那些有资格贷款者都拥有充足的现金并小心控制支出，而那些急需贷款者 — — 高负债的家庭和企业（尤其是中小企业 ） — —都在面对着信贷紧缩。 货币渠道同样也存在缺陷。 当全球增长减弱之时，即便美元贬值也难以使净出口出现极大改善。 此外，许多主要中央银行都在和美联储一样实施某些量化宽松政策的变体，抵消了美联储行动对美元价值的影响。 或许更重要的是，一个弱势美元对贸易平衡的作用以及因此对增长的影响会受到两个因素的限制。 首先，一个弱势美元是与一个更高的大宗商品美元采购价格联系在一起的，而这也意味着会对贸易平衡产生拖累，因为美国是一个大宗商品的净进口国。 其二，任何源自于更强劲出口的GDP改善都会引发进口增加。 观察研究预计弱势美元对贸易平衡的总体影响接近于零。 量化宽松向实体经济传导的另外唯一一个重要渠道就是股市上涨所带来的财富效应，但在QE3将引发股票价格持续上涨的观点中存在着某种自相矛盾的东西。 如果持续的资产再膨胀需要GDP增长显著复苏来实现的话，那么声称如果股票价格能在量化宽松之后出现足够上涨，而因此产生的由财富效应所引发的GDP上涨就证明资产价格上升是合理的说法就是一个有逻辑的废话罢了。 如果货币政策向实体经济的传导渠道出了问题，人们也不能假设量化宽松会对经济增长产生较大影响。 美联储主席本·伯南克最近强调了另一条额外渠道的重要性：信心渠道，美联储维持大量货币供应状况的承诺可以改善私人消费。 问题是这些措施就能有多大实质性，又能维持多长时间？ 在一个不断去杠杆化，充满宏观不确定因素，劳动市场增长疲弱以及财政拖累的现状下，信心是极为脆弱的。 简而言之，QE3减少了立刻出现经济收缩的尾部风险，但也不可能为一个依然承受着痛苦去杠杆化过程的经济体立刻带来持续复苏。 在短期内，QE3会令投资者敢于承担风险，并会刺激温和的资产价格再膨胀。 但如果经济增长令人失望的话 — — 这情况很可能出现，股票价格的上升也会随着时间逐渐消弭，并拖低对企业收入和盈利的预期。"

            "Quantitative Quicksand PITTSBURGH – Almost all recoveries from recession have included rapid employment growth – until now. Though advanced-country central banks have pursued expansionary monetary policy in the wake of the global economic crisis in an effort to boost demand, job creation has lagged. As a result, workers, increasingly convinced that they will be unable to find employment for a sustained period, are leaving the labor force in droves. Nowhere is this phenomenon more pronounced than in the United States, where the Federal Reserve has reduced interest rates to unprecedented levels and, through quantitative easing (QE), augmented bank reserves by purchasing financial assets. But inflation – which rapid money-supply expansion inevitably fuels – has so far remained subdued, at roughly 2%, because banks are not using their swelling reserves to expand credit and increase liquidity. While this is keeping price volatility in check, it is also hindering employment growth. Rather than changing its approach, however, the Fed has responded to slow employment growth by launching additional rounds of QE. Apparently, its rationale is that if expanding reserves by more than $2 trillion has not produced the desired results, adding $85 billion more monthly – another $1 trillion this year – might do the trick. America’s central bankers need not search far to find out why QE is not working; evidence is published regularly for anyone to see. During QE2 (from November 2010 to July 2011), the Fed added a total of $557.9 billion to reserves, and excess reserves grew by $546.5 billion. That means that banks circulated only 2% of QE2’s contribution, leaving the rest idle. Similarly, since QE3 was launched last September, total bank reserves have grown by $244.1 billion, and excess reserves by $239.4 billion – meaning that 99% of the funds remain idle. Given that banks earn 0.25% in interest on their reserve accounts, but pay very low – indeed, near-zero – interest to their depositors, they might choose to leave the money idle, drawing risk-free interest, rather than circulate it through the economy. At current interest rates, banks lend to the government, large stable corporations, and commercial real-estate dealers; they do not extend credit to riskier borrowers, like start-up companies or first-time home buyers. While speculators and bankers profit from the decline in interest rates that accompanies the Fed’s asset purchases, the intended monetary and credit stimulus is absent. At some point, the Fed must realize that its current policy is not working. But developing a more effective alternative requires an understanding of the US economy’s actual problems – something that the Fed also seems to lack. Indeed, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke often says that his goal is to prevent another Great Depression, even though the Fed addressed that risk effectively in 2008. The US economy has not responded to the Fed’s monetary expansion, because America’s biggest problems are not liquidity problems. As every economics student learns early on, monetary policy cannot fix problems in the real economy; only policy changes affecting the real economy can. The Fed should relearn that lesson. One major problem, insufficient investment, is rooted in President Barack Obama’s effort to increase the tax paid by those whose annual incomes exceed $250,000 and, more recently, in his proposal to cap retirement entitlements. While such proposals have been met with opposition, Obama cannot be expected to sign a deficit-reduction bill that does not include more revenue. As long as that revenue’s sources, and the future effects of new regulations, remain uncertain, those whom the policies would most harm – the country’s largest savers – are unlikely to invest. Likewise, Obama’s health-care reform, the Affordable Care Act, has hampered employment growth, as businesses reduce their hiring and cut workers’ hours to shelter themselves from increased labor costs (estimates of the rise vary). Meanwhile, the faltering European economy and slowing GDP growth in China and elsewhere are impeding export demand. While subdued liquidity and credit growth are delaying the inflationary impact of the Fed’s determination to expand banks’ already-massive reserves, America cannot escape inflation forever. The reserves that the Fed – and almost all other major central banks – are building will eventually be used.",
            "量化流沙 匹兹堡—几乎所有衰退后的复苏都伴随着快速的就业增长 — — 目前除外。 尽管发达国家央行面对全球经济危机采取了扩张性货币政策以提振需求，就业创造始终萎靡不振。 结果，日益感到自己无法找到持续工作的工人正在陆续离开劳动力市场。 这一现象在美国最为明显，美联储将利率降至前所未有的低水平，并通过量化宽松购买金融资产从而扩大了银行准备金。 但通货膨胀 — — 应该是快速货币供给扩张的必然结果 — — 至今仍然不见起色，维持在2%左右，这是因为银行并没有用增加的准备金扩大信用、增加流动性。 尽管这让物价免于波动，但也阻碍了就业增长。 但是，美联储并没有改变方针，而是以增加一轮又一轮量化宽松应对就业增长缓慢的问题。 显然，美联储的考虑是，既然增加2万多亿美元还不能形成渴望的结果，那么每个月再增加850亿美元 — — 今年再增1万亿 — — 可能就会有所成效吧。 美国的中央银行家需要花点力气找找为何量化宽松没有效果；证据一直在发表，每个人都看得见。 在第二次量化宽松（QE2，2010年11月—2011年7月）期间，美联储增加了总共5579亿美元的准备金，超额准备金增加了5465亿美元。 这意味着银行只发放了2%的QE2规模，剩下的部分都闲置着。 类似地，自去年9月推出第三次量化宽松（QE3）以来，银行总准备金增加了2441亿美元，超额准备金增加了2394亿美元 — — 99%的资金被闲置了。 银行的准备金账户可以获得0.25%的利息，而它们对储户所付出的的利息非常低（实际近于零 ） ， 它们可能选择让这些钱闲置获得无风险利息，而不是把它们注入经济中。 在当前利率下，银行把钱贷给政府、稳定的大公司和商业地产交易商；而不会扩大对高风险借款人的信用，比如创业公司或首次购房者。 投机者和银行家从美联储资产购买计划所带来的利率下降中获益，而计划中的货币和信用刺激却打了水漂。 迟早，美联储必须认识到目前的政策是无效的。 但开发更有效的替代政策需要了解美国经济的核心问题 — — 这也是美联储没有做到的。 事实上，美联储主席伯南克经常说，他的目标是避免另一次大萧条，尽管美联储在2008年就已经打消了这一风险。 美国经济没有响应美联储的货币扩张，因为美国最大的问题不是流动性问题。 每个经济学学生很早就会学到，货币政策无法修正实体经济的问题；只有影响实体经济的政策变化可以。 美联储应该回去重修。 一大问题 — — 投资不足的根源是奥巴马总统试图提高年收入250000以上人群的税收以及最近的退休福利封顶方案。 尽管这些方案遇到了反对，但奥巴马不可能签署不包括增加收入的赤字削减法案。 只要收入源以及新规则的未来影响尚不明确，受这些政策伤害最大的人群 — — 美国最大的储蓄者 — — 就不可能投资。 类似地，奥巴马的医疗改革 — — 平价医疗法案（Affordable Care Act）阻碍了就业增长，因为企业减少了招聘，削减了工人的工时，以应对劳动力成本的上升（上升幅度估计各不相同 ） 。 与此同时，萎靡的欧洲经济和中国和其他地区GDP增长的放缓拖累了出口需求。 尽管受抑制的流动性和信用增长推迟了美联储扩张银行已然相当庞大的准备金规模的决定的通胀性效果，但美国不可能永远逃脱通胀。 美联储 — — 以及几乎所有其他世界主要央行 — — 所注入的准备金迟早会用起来。"

            "Shinzo Abe’s Monetary-Policy Delusions NEW HAVEN – The politicization of central banking continues unabated. The resurrection of Shinzo Abe and Japan’s Liberal Democratic Party – pillars of the political system that has left the Japanese economy mired in two lost decades and counting – is just the latest case in point. Japan’s recent election hinged critically on Abe’s views of the Bank of Japan’s monetary policy stance. He argued that a timid BOJ should learn from its more aggressive counterparts, the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank. Just as the Fed and the ECB have apparently saved the day through their unconventional and aggressive quantitative easing (QE), goes the argument, Abe believes it is now time for the BOJ to do the same. It certainly looks as if he will get his way. With BOJ Governor Masaaki Shirakawa’s term ending in April, Abe will be able to select a successor – and two deputy governors as well – to do his bidding. But will it work? While experimental monetary policy is now widely accepted as standard operating procedure in today’s post-crisis era, its efficacy is dubious. Nearly four years after the world hit bottom in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, QE’s impact has been strikingly asymmetric. While massive liquidity injections were effective in unfreezing credit markets and arrested the worst of the crisis – witness the role of the Fed’s first round of QE in 2009-2010 – subsequent efforts have not sparked anything close to a normal cyclical recovery. The reason is not hard to fathom. Hobbled by severe damage to private and public-sector balance sheets, and with policy interest rates at or near zero, post-bubble economies have been mired in a classic “liquidity trap.” They are more focused on paying down massive debt overhangs built up before the crisis than on assuming new debt and boosting aggregate demand. The sad case of the American consumer is a classic example of how this plays out. In the years leading up to the crisis, two bubbles – property and credit – fueled a record-high personal-consumption binge. When the bubbles burst, households understandably became fixated on balance-sheet repair – namely, paying down debt and rebuilding personal savings, rather than resuming excessive spending habits. Indeed, notwithstanding an unprecedented post-crisis tripling of Fed assets to roughly $3 trillion – probably on their way to $4 trillion over the next year – US consumers have pulled back as never before. In the 19 quarters since the start of 2008, annualized growth of inflation-adjusted consumer spending has averaged just 0.7% – almost three percentage points below the 3.6% trend increases recorded in the 11 years ending in 2006. Nor does the ECB have reason to be gratified with its strain of quantitative easing. Despite a doubling of its balance sheet, to a little more than €3 trillion ($4 trillion), Europe has slipped back into recession for the second time in four years. Not only is QE’s ability to jumpstart crisis-torn, balance-sheet-constrained economies limited; it also runs the important risk of blurring the distinction between monetary and fiscal policy. Central banks that buy sovereign debt issued by fiscal authorities offset market-imposed discipline on borrowing costs, effectively subsidizing public-sector profligacy. Unfortunately, it appears that Japan has forgotten many of its own lessons – especially the BOJ’s disappointing experience with zero interest rates and QE in the early 2000’s. But it has also lost sight of the 1990’s – the first of its so-called lost decades – when the authorities did all they could to prolong the life of insolvent banks and many nonfinancial corporations. Zombie-like companies were kept on artificial life-support in the false hope that time alone would revive them. It was not until late in the decade, when the banking sector was reorganized and corporate restructuring was encouraged, that Japan made progress on the long, arduous road of balance-sheet repair and structural transformation. US authorities have succumbed to the same Japanese-like temptations. From quantitative easing to record-high federal budget deficits to unprecedented bailouts, they have done everything in their power to mask the pain of balance-sheet repair and structural adjustment. As a result, America has created its own generation of zombies – in this case, zombie consumers. Like Japan, America’s post-bubble healing has been limited – even in the face of the Fed’s outsize liquidity injections. Household debt stood at 112% of income in the third quarter of 2012 – down from record highs in 2006, but still nearly 40 percentage points above the 75% norm of the last three decades of the twentieth century. Similarly, the personal-saving rate, at just 3.5% in the four months ending in November 2012, was less than half the 7.9% average of 1970-99. The same is true of Europe. The ECB’s über-aggressive actions have achieved little in the way of bringing about long-awaited structural transformation in the region. Crisis-torn peripheral European economies still suffer from unsustainable debt loads and serious productivity and competitiveness problems. And a fragmented European banking system remains one of the weakest links in the regional daisy chain. Is this the “cure” that Abe really wants for Japan? The last thing that the Japanese economy needs at this point is backsliding on structural reforms. Yet, by forcing the BOJ to follow in the misdirected footsteps of the Fed and the ECB, that is precisely the risk that Abe and Japan are facing. Massive liquidity injections carried out by the world’s major central banks – the Fed, the ECB, and the BOJ – are neither achieving traction in their respective real economies, nor facilitating balance-sheet repair and structural change. That leaves a huge sum of excess liquidity sloshing around in global asset markets. Where it goes, the next crisis is inevitably doomed to follow.",
            "安倍晋三的货币政策迷思 发自纽黑文 — — 中央银行政治化的趋势有增无减。 而安倍晋三以及日本自民党的卷土重来 — — 它们都是使日本经济从20多年前至今依然陷入停滞的政治系统的核心元素 — — 只是这一现象的最新注解而已。 日本近期的选举与安倍对日本银行货币政策立场的见解紧密联系在一起。 他指出过于谨慎的日本央行应该向它更为激进的同行 — — 美联储和欧洲央行 — — 学习。 而正如美联储和欧洲央行显然通过非常规且激进的量化宽松政策挽救了大局一样，安倍认为日本央行也是时候该采取相同的行动了。 而如今看来安倍似乎也将如愿以偿。 随着日本央行行长白川方明（Masaaki Shirakawa）的任期于明年四月份届满，首相就可以另选一位继任者 — — 以及两个副行长 — — 来执行他的命令。 但这种政策能起作用吗？ 尽管在后危机时代的今天，实验性的货币政策被当作标准的操作流程进得到大范围推广，但其有效性依然值得怀疑。 世界经济在全球金融危机冲击下触底后的近四年里，量化宽松政策的影响明显不对称。 大量流动性的注入的确在解冻信贷市场上取得成效并阻止了危机深度恶化 — — 这在美联储2009-2010年度首轮量化宽松政策中得到了证明 — — 然而随后的措施都未能催生任何常见的周期性复苏。 其中原因并不难理解。 由于私营及公共企业的资产负债表受到严重破坏，政策利率又几近为零，后泡沫经济已经陷入了典型的“流动性陷阱 ” 。 相对于进一步举债或刺激总需求，人们更加关心如何偿还危机之前积累的巨额债务。 美国消费者的悲剧正是这种政策后果的典型例子。 在危机前的几年中，两种经济泡沫 — — 房地产和信贷 — — 加剧了创纪录的个人消费热潮。 当泡沫爆发时，不难理解每个家庭都开始关注如何改善其负债 — — 也就是偿还债务并重新开始储蓄，而不是恢复过度消费的习惯。 确实，尽管前所未有的危机后美联储资产大概翻了三倍到3万亿美元 — — 并可能在未来一年内达到4万亿美元，美国的消费还是前所未有的回落了。 自2008年初以来的19个季度中，计入通胀因素后消费支出的年化增长率平均仅为0.7 % — —几乎比截至2006年的前11年每年3.6%的增长趋势低了3个百分点。 欧洲央行也没有理由为其量化宽松政策的作为而感到满意。 尽管它的资产翻了倍，达到3万多亿欧元（折合约4万亿美元 ） ， 欧洲已经在四年中第二次回落到衰退状态。 不仅量化宽松政策重启那些饱受危机折磨且资产负债表受制的经济体的能力有限；它还冒着模糊货币政策和财政政策之间区别的重大风险。 那些购买由财政当局发行的主权债务的央行逃脱了市场对借贷成本施加的约束，实际上资助了公共部门的挥霍行为。 不幸地是，日本似乎忘了自身所经历的许多教训 — — 尤其是日本央行在2000年代实施零利率和量化宽松政策的沮丧经历。 但它同时也也忘记了1990年代 — — 也是第一个所谓“失落的10年 ” — —再此期间当局尽其所能延长资不抵债的银行和许多非金融公司的寿命。 这些行尸走肉般的公司靠着人为力量勉强继续运行，它们都抱着一种虚幻的希望 — — 时间能够拯救一切。 直到这个10年的末期，当银行开始重组而且企业也被鼓励重组时，日本才在修复资产负债表和结构改革的道路上取得了进步。 美国当局已经屈服于与日本一样的诱惑。 从量化宽松政策到破纪录的联邦预算赤字都被用于前所未有的救援行动，他们用尽一切力量来掩饰资产负债表修复与结构调整所带来的痛苦。 结果，美国已经创造出了它自己的僵尸 — — 也就是僵尸消费者。 跟日本一样，美国泡沫破裂后的恢复是有限的 — — 即使是在美联储注入大规模流动资金的情况下。 2012年第三季度美国家庭负债相当于收入的112 % — —虽然较2006年的创纪录高位有所回落，但仍比20世纪最后30年75%的标准高了几乎40个百分点。 同样，2012年截止到11月的后四个月中个人储蓄率仅为3.5 % ， 这还不到1970~1999年7.9%的平均储蓄率的一半。 欧洲的情况也是如此，欧洲央行过于激进的行动并未在区内促成人们期待已久的结构性改革。 饱受危机折磨的欧洲外围经济体仍然面对着无法承受的债务负担和严重的生产力和竞争力问题。 而碎片化的欧洲银行体系仍然是区域链条中最脆弱的一环。 这就是安倍想为日本寻求的“解决方案”吗？ 此时日本经济最不需要的就是结构改革的倒退。 然而通过迫使日本央行追随美联储和欧洲央行的错误步伐，这正是安倍和日本所面临的风险。 由世界主要的央行 — — 即美联储、欧洲央行、日本央行 — — 贯彻的大规模流动性注入既不能在各自的实体经济里促进交易，也不能促进资产负债表修复和结构性变革。 这就让大量多余的流动资金在全球资本市场上流动。 不管这些资金流到何处，下一个危机也无可避免地注定随之而来。"

            "Why Remember Pearl Harbor? NEW YORK – December 7 marks the 67th anniversary of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Over the years, “the day of infamy” has become a classic reference point for galvanizing patriotic sentiment in America. In the wake of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attack, for example, analogies to Pearl Harbor were made frequently. But despite its central place in America’s collective memory, Pearl Harbor remains little understood. Why did Japan initiate such a seemingly self-destructive war in the first place? Aside from lessons that Japan must learn from its momentous decision, is there something to be learned by the United States as well? The decision to attack Pearl Harbor was reached after five months of deliberations that included numerous official conferences. It was a gradual process in which more sympathetic, albeit firm, US engagement might have helped sway Japan in a different direction. In fact, Japanese government opinion was so divided that it is surprising that it was able to unite in the end. Many in the Japanese Army initially regarded the Soviet Union as the main threat facing the country. Others saw the US as the primary enemy. Some were concerned with more abstract, ideological enemies, such as Communism and “Americanism,” while there were also voices highlighting the menace of the “white race” (including Japan’s allies, Germany and Italy) against the “yellow race.” Then there were those who preferred not to fight any enemy at all, particularly the US, whose long-term war-making power, the government knew, far surpassed Japan’s own. The tactical mastermind of the Pearl Harbor operation, Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, was one of them. Over the course of the summer of 1941, events slowly tilted Japan towards the possibility of war with the West. But Pearl Harbor was in no way inevitable. Germany’s attack on the Soviet Union compelled Japan in July 1941 to prepare a plan of attack. Although it made clear Japan’s desire to take advantage of the European conflict and gain a foothold in the European colonies in Southeast Asia, the plan was not clear about who constituted Japan’s true enemy. Japan’s military thrust into Southeast Asia led President Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s administration to impose sanctions. The US froze Japanese assets, an example followed by Britain and the Dutch East Indies. When Japan responded by taking over southern French Indochina, the US retaliated by imposing an embargo on oil exports to Japan. Rather than telling Japan that the US was determined to search for a diplomatic solution, America’s categorical reaction confirmed it to the Japanese as an arrogant and conceited enemy. Moreover, by transferring its Pacific Fleet from San Diego to Pearl Harbor, the US encouraged the Japanese understanding that the US fully anticipated war with Japan. World War II in the Pacific finally came about for many different reasons. But it was, above all, the sense of encirclement and humiliation that united the deeply divided Japanese government. Feeling defeated by a series of failed approaches to the US, including an overture to hold direct talks with Roosevelt, Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe resigned on October 16, making hard-line Army Minister Hideki Tōjō his successor. The high-handed tone of the Hull Note of November 26, demanding Japan’s withdrawal of all its troops from China, was a final blow to the moderates in Japan’s government, who still hoped for diplomatic negotiations. By this time, many policymakers were convinced that the US was not ready to hear them out. It was ultimately in the name of saving Asia for all Asians from what was regarded as Western arrogance that the government united to wage war. On December 1, it was decided that the war would commence in six days. There were legitimate historical reasons for Japan to feel humiliated on the eve of war. The gunboat diplomacy that resulted in the opening of Japan and unequal treaties in the mid-19th century was but a beginning. More immediately, the Great Depression and the subsequent compartmentalization of the world into economic blocs also worked to the advantage of the already powerful. Coupled with the economic hardship of the interwar years were instances of racial prejudice in the US that aimed at preventing Japanese immigration. United by this long-simmering and humiliating sense of exclusion, Japanese policymakers, whatever their differences, stumbled toward the December 1 decision to go to war. With almost 70 years of hindsight, Pearl Harbor should offer some lessons for US foreign policy today. Despite obvious differences between Pearl Harbor and recent Islamist terrorist tactics, they show the common desire of self-proclaimed Davids to topple their Goliaths in a clearly lop-sided battle. These Davids depend on Western technologies to overcome imbalances of power, and are driven by a sense of real or imagined humiliation. But no matter how strong and historically justified such grievances may be those who resort to murderous tactics must be condemned. However, high-handedness and tough talk alone are an inadequate response, for this approach further humiliates those who already feel humiliated, and alienates those who might otherwise proffer a more moderate voice. Diplomacy no longer works with terrorism, but it can help to prevent it by dealing carefully with potentially hostile states. With global expectations mounting for a fresh start in US foreign policy, it is vital not just to remember, but to understand the attack on Pearl Harbor.",
            "纪念珍珠港事件 纽约 - - 今年12月7日是日本攻击珍珠港事件67周年纪念日。 多年来，人们用这一“奇耻大辱之日”激发美国爱国情怀百试不爽。 例如，在2001年9月11日恐怖主义攻击事件后，人们经常把它和珍珠港事件进行类比。 但是尽管珍珠港在美国人的集体记忆中占据中心地位，但是人们对它还是一知半解。 日本为何进行这一看起来是自我毁灭的战争呢？ 除了日本要从这一重大决定中吸取教训之外，美国有没有经验教训要总结呢？ 袭击珍珠港的决定是在经过五个月的审议后做出的，决策过程中举行了难以计数的会议。 这是一个渐进的过程。 在这一过程中，如果美国坚定而又富有同情地与日本接触，那么或许会把日本引向另一个方向。 实际上，日本政府内部观点充满分歧，最终能够团结一致实在令人惊讶。 日本皇军有许多人把苏联视为国家面临的主要威胁。 其他人则把美国视为主要敌人。 有人担心更为抽象的意识形态上的敌人，例如共产主义和所谓“美国主义 ” 。 还有人则强调“白种人 ” ( 包括日本的盟国德国和意大利)对“黄种人”的威胁。 进而，还有人希望根本不要打仗，特别是与美国打仗。 政府知道，美国的长久作战实力远远超过日本。 珍珠港行动的战术策划人海军上将山本五十六就是其中反对之人。 1941年夏天，各种事件逐步把日本推向与西方开战。 但是袭击珍珠港决非不可避免。 德国攻击苏联迫使日本在1941年准备进攻方案。 尽管这一方案明确了日本利用欧战并且在欧洲各国在东南亚取得立足点的愿望，但是它并未明确说明谁是日本的真正敌人。 日本军队攻入东南亚导致美国总统罗斯福当局实行制裁。 美国冻结了日本的资产，英国和荷属东印度也随后效仿。 日本通过占领法属印度支那南部还以颜色，美国则对日本实行石油禁运予以报复。 美国不仅没有告诉日本它决心寻求外交解决途经，其坚硬的反应措施使得日本确信美国是一个自负的敌人。 而且，美国将太平洋舰队从圣地亚哥转移到珍珠港，促使日本认为美国完全打算与日本开战。 第二次世界大战的太平洋战争最后打响有多种不同的原因。 但是首先是因为被包围感和屈辱感使得原本意见分歧严重的日本政府团结起来。 日本首相近卫文磨试图接近美国包括与美国总统罗斯福举行直接会谈，但是都无功而返。 他深感受挫而在10月16日辞职，把首相位子让给了强硬派陆军大臣东条英机。 美国国务卿赫尔11月26日照会日本言辞高傲严厉，要求日本从中国完全撤军。 这是对依旧希望外交谈判的日本政府温和派的最后一击。 到了此时，许多决策者都相信美国并不打算听取他们意见。 日本政府最后以大东亚共荣、抵御洋人傲慢无理的名义联合一致开战。 12月1日，日本决定在六天内开战。 战前日本感觉受到屈辱是有合理历史原因的。 炮舰外交迫使日本门户开放并且在十九世纪中叶签署不平等条约只是一个开始。 更为直接的是，经济大萧条以及随之而来各国经济组成集团同样有利于早先的列强。 伴随两次世界大战之间经济困境的是美国种族偏见，意在防止日本移民。 日本决策者由于这一长期潜伏、令人羞辱的排斥之感而不顾彼此分歧，于12月1日决定开战。 珍珠港事件过去将近70年时间。 有了这一后见，这一事件应该给美国当今的外交政策提供某些经验教训。 尽管珍珠港事件和最近伊斯兰恐怖主义伎俩有明显的不同，但是它们都显现出在一场实力对比悬殊的战斗中鱼死网破的愿望。 这些弱者依靠西方技术克服实力不平衡，而且他们都受到实际或者想像中受辱感的驱使。 但是，无论这些冤屈有多么强烈、具有多少历史合理性，那些采取谋杀伎俩的人都应该受到谴责。 但是，仅仅是态度强硬和严厉对话尚不足以回应，因为这一手段进一步羞辱那些已经感到受辱的人，并且让那些原本温和派离心离德。 对于恐怖主义外交已经无济于事，但是外交可以帮助认真应对潜在的敌对国家。 现在全世界日益期待美国���交改头换面，因此，不仅怀念、而且理解珍珠港事件也就越发重要。"

            "Why Obamacare Survived CAMBRIDGE – Since the United States’ Affordable Care Act (ACA) – or “Obamacare” – was enacted in 2010, Republicans have been promising to “repeal and replace” it. When the 2016 presidential and congressional elections delivered all three branches of the US government to the party, the time to fulfill that promise seemed to have arrived. Yet the anti-Obamacare crusade has just been dealt a crushing blow, owing to the refusal of some Republican senators to vote for the replacement legislation. Republicans blame their failure on the Democrats’ refusal to cooperate. But why should the Democrats help to dismantle their biggest legislative achievement of the last decade (if not longer)? The major flaws in Obamacare are not, as has been argued, unintended consequences of a poorly designed policy, which thus must be replaced; instead, they stem from Republican demands. In any case, Republicans have majorities in both houses of Congress, so they don’t actually need the Democrats’ support to pass legislation. Likewise, President Donald Trump’s unprecedented lack of experience and general incompetence cannot be at fault, as he isn’t indispensible to the repeal and replace process. The truth is that the blame belongs squarely on the shoulders of congressional Republicans. Since 2010, they voted more than 50 times to repeal the ACA. Those votes may have been merely symbolic, given Obama’s veto power; nonetheless, the striking fact remains that the Republicans never bothered to try to formulate an alternative in the event that one of their own would one day become president. In fact, they couldn’t formulate a workable alternative to Obamacare, because some within their ranks refuse to accept the basic laws of arithmetic. According to the estimates produced by the Congressional Budget Office, which has a very good track record, the Republicans’ proposed health-care legislation would have caused more than 20 million Americans to lose insurance coverage. But many Republicans continue to insist that they can somehow slash spending and eliminate rules and requirements, including the “individual mandate” (the requirement that all Americans have health insurance) that underpins Obamacare, without affecting current coverage levels. Of course, there are Republicans who acknowledge the facts. Some support repeal and replace anyway: Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, for example, is a relatively consistent libertarian who believes that the benefits of minimizing the government’s role in health care somehow outweigh the costs to lower- and middle-income working Americans. Others recognize that the costs are unacceptable – indeed, that is why the Republican-proposed replacement has just been rejected – but have been unable to put forward any credible alternative. Logically, there should be a third group of moderate Republicans who acknowledge the arithmetic, find it unacceptable, and commit either to reforming Obamacare or developing some other realistic plan that can deliver better health insurance to more Americans. Unfortunately, there is nobody left in this category, except perhaps Senator Susan Collins of Maine. But there is another, deeper reason why the Republicans cannot come up with an alternative to Obamacare: the ACA is based firmly on their own ideas. For example, the individual mandate that they now decry was originally developed by conservative think tanks seeking to devise a workable system of national health insurance with the smallest possible role for the government. It was the centerpiece of Massachusetts’ health-care reform signed by Mitt Romney in 2006, when he was the state’s governor. The individual mandate is essential to barring insurance companies from discriminating against those with pre-existing conditions – a provision that even Obamacare’s opponents want to keep. It is not financially feasible for private insurance companies to insure people who are already sick or at high risk, if those who are still healthy are not also in the pool. This does not mean that the US needs to go to the extreme of a full-on socialized health-care system, whereby the government directly provides health care to all (though the British are certainly attached to their National Health Service). And, indeed, nobody in the US is calling for that. What some – most vocally, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders – have proposed is a single-payer system. In Canada, such a system of government insurance and private provision of services delivers strong health outcomes at a fraction of the cost of the US system. Yet, while a substantial share of Americans may support such a system, a single-payer program would face strong resistance from three powerful groups: the insurance industry, consumers who are happy with their current employer-paid plans, and Republicans in general. But the system many Republicans tout – a scheme based fully on “personal responsibility” – is not feasible. The system the US had before Obamacare did not meet that standard, as the uninsured imposed costs not just on themselves, but also on other Americans. Those without insurance are more likely to experience conditions like obesity and addiction, and to let their health deteriorate before seeking medical attention. Before Obamacare, hospitals would simply pass the higher costs of treating them on to other patients. A system of genuine personal responsibility would require that the medical profession not provide care that it feels ethically obliged to provide. But I have yet to meet a free-market conservative who would truly favor a new federal law requiring ambulances to leave accident victims by the side of the road unless they can show proof of insurance. The solution to America’s health-care woes lies somewhere between socialized medicine and laissez-faire. But there is no question that it must include something like the three legs of the Obamacare “stool”: the individual mandate, protection for those with pre-existing conditions, and a means to pay for it all. Though some Republicans pretend otherwise, there is simply no solution that decreases the role of government without increasing the ranks of the uninsured – and thus raising total health-care costs.",
            "奥巴马医保为什么能活下来 坎布里奇—自美国平价医疗法（ACA ） ， 即“奥巴马医保”于2010年实施以来，共和党一直承诺要“取消并取代”它。 2016年的总统和议会选举让美国政府的三大机关全都落入共和党之手，实现这一承诺的良机按理说已经到来。 但反奥巴马医保运动却遭受重创，因为一些共和党参议员拒绝投票支持取代它的法案。 共和党将它们的失败归咎于民主党拒绝配合。 但民主党为什么要帮共和党取消他们在过去十年（乃至更长时间）里所获得的最大的立法成就？ 奥巴马医保的最大缺陷并不是有人所谓的政策设计漏洞所造成的意外后果（因此必须用别的政策取而代之 ） ； 相反，这些缺陷来自共和党的要求。 说到底，共和党拥有国会两院的多数地位，因此他们其实不需要民主党的支持就可以通过法案。 类似地，总统特朗普登峰造极的缺少经验和无能也不是借口，因为他并不是取消和取代过程的必要条件。 真相是这完全应该归咎于国会共和党。 自2010年以来，他们进行了50多次投票要取消ACA。 这些投票有的只是象征性的（因为奥巴马拥有否决权 ） ； 但重要的事实仍然是，共和党一直在酝酿替代方案，等到共和党成为总统时就可以取ACA而代之。 事实上，他们不可能制定出有效的奥巴马医保替代方案，因为一些共和党人拒绝承认基本算术。 根据国会预算办公室的测算 — — 其具有相当好的历史记录 — — 共和党提出的医保立法将导致2,000多万美国人失去医疗保险。 但许多共和党人仍然坚持他们可以设法削减支出，取消规则和要求，包括奥巴马医保的基石 — — “个人强制保险 ” ， 而不会影响到当前的医保覆盖水平。 当然，也有承认事实的共和党人。 但仍有一些支持取消和取代：比如，肯塔基州参议员兰德·保罗（Rand Paul）相对来说是一个一贯的自由派，认为政府的医保角色最小化的好处要大于美国中低收入工作阶级所增加的成本。 也有人认为成本令人难以接受 — — 事实上，这正是共和党提出的取代政策惨遭拒绝的原因 — — 但又拿不出任何可信的替代方案。 从逻辑上讲，应该有第三类温和派共和党，他们承认基本算术，发现了它根本难以接受，并决心改革奥巴马医保或制定其他能够给更多美国人带来更好的医疗保险的现实的计划。 不幸的是，属于这个类别的一个人也没有，兴许缅因州参议员苏珊·柯林斯（Susan Collins）是个例外。 但对于为何共和党人拿不出奥巴马医保的替代方案，还有一个更深层次的原因：ACA完全符合他们自己的想法。 比如，他们现在所攻讦的个人强制保险，原本就是由保守派智库提出的，目的是要设计一个政府在其中的作用最小化的可行的全国医保体系。 这也是米特·罗姆尼（Mitt Romney）2006年担任马萨诸塞州州长时签署的该州医保改革的核心内容。 个人强制保险是防止保险公司歧视疾患人士的必要条件 — — 这一点即使是奥巴马医保的反对者也是同意的。 私营保险公司为已经患病或患病风险很高的人提供保险在财务上是不可行的，如果不把那些仍然健康的人也纳入其中的话。 这并不意味着美国需要走极端，采取全面社会化的医保体系，即政府直接为全民提供医疗（尽管英国人全都拥有国民医疗服务 ） 。 而事实上，在美国也没有任何人要求这样做。 一些人 — — 首屈一指的要数佛蒙特州参议员伯尼·桑德斯（Bernie Sanders ） — —提出了一个偿付者（single-payer）体系。 在加拿大，这一政府保险和私人服务体系与美国的医疗体系相比，可谓事半功倍。 然而，尽管会有很大一部分美国人支持单一偿付者体系，该体系将面临三大权势集团的抵制：保险业、对目前的雇主偿付体系很满意的消费者，以及大部分共和党。 但许多共和党人所吹捧的体系 — — 一套完全基于“个人责任”的机制 — — 根本不可行。 在奥巴马医保前，美国实施的体系达不到这一标准，无保险覆盖者不但给自己造成了成本，也给其他美国人造成了成本。 无保险覆盖者更有可能发生肥胖和毒瘾等情况，并且往往放任身体恶化而不去寻医问药。 在奥巴马医保实施前，医院只需要将治疗他们的高昂成本转嫁给其他患者即可。 一套真正的个人责任体系要求医疗界不提供在道义上有义务提供的医疗服务。 但迄今为止我还没有遇到过一位自由市场保守派，真正支持实施新的联邦法律，要求救护车在事故受害者拿不出医保证明的情况下，将他仍在路旁。 美国就医难问题的解决方案必然要兼顾社会化医疗和自由放任。 但毫无疑问，这必须包括奥巴马医保“板凳”的三条腿：个人强制保险、覆盖疾患人士，以及为全体公民偿付的方法。 尽管一些共和党人装作在寻找替代方案，但根本不存在既能限制政府的角色，又不会提高无保险覆盖者地位（ranks ） — —从而提高医保总成本 — — 的办法。"

            "Helping the Other 66% CAMBRIDGE – What is remarkable about the increase in nationalist sentiment across the developed world in recent years is that it is occurring at a time when many of today’s most pressing challenges, including climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic, are fundamentally global problems demanding global solutions. And the anger brewing among citizens of vaccine-poor countries – basically, the two-thirds of humanity living outside the advanced economies and China – could come back to haunt the rich world all too soon. US President Joe Biden’s ambitious plans to address inequality in America are to be welcomed, provided the administration succeeds in covering the long-run costs through higher taxes or stronger growth, admittedly two big ifs. So, too, is the smaller but still significant Next Generation EU scheme to help European Union members such as Italy and Spain that have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic. The 16% of the world’s people who live in advanced economies have had a tough pandemic but are now looking forward to a recovery. China, which accounts for another 18% of the world’s population, was the first major economy to rebound, thanks mainly to its better epidemic preparedness and greater state capacity to contain the coronavirus. But what about everyone else? As the International Monetary Fund highlights in its April World Economic Outlook, there is a dangerous global divergence. The horrific wave of COVID-19 in India is likely a preview of what is still to come across much of the developing world, where poverty has exploded. Most countries are unlikely to return to their pre-pandemic output levels until at least the end of 2022. Until now, the twenty-first century had been a story of catch-up for the developing world, far more so than had seemed likely in the 1980s and 1990s. But the COVID-19 crisis has hit poorer countries just as the rich world is waking up to the fact that containing both the pandemic and the looming climate catastrophe depends hugely on the efforts of developing economies. That is not to mention the cooperation likely to be needed to contain terrorist groups and rogue-state actors in a world seething about the global inequities that the pandemic has laid bare. Making matters worse, much of the developing world, including emerging markets, entered the pandemic with sharply elevated external debts. Overnight monetary-policy rates may be zero or negative in advanced economies, but they average over 4% in emerging markets and developing economies, with longer-term borrowing – the kind needed for development – much more expensive. A number of countries, including Argentina, Zambia, and Lebanon, have already defaulted. Many more could follow when the uneven recovery pushes up global interest rates. How, then, can poorer countries pay for COVID-19 vaccines and relief, much less the transition to a green economy? The World Bank and the IMF are under enormous pressure to find solutions, and have been doing a good job in at least explaining the problem. But these organizations lack the financial structure needed to deal with challenges of this scale. In the near term, a new allocation of special drawing rights (the IMF’s reserve asset) can help, but this instrument is too crude and ill-designed to use on a routine basis. The Bretton Woods institutions established at the end of World War II were designed to act mainly as lenders. But just as rich countries gave their own citizens outright transfers during the pandemic, the same needs to be done for developing economies. Higher debts will only aggravate the likely defaults in the pandemic’s aftermath, particularly given the difficulties involved in determining seniority among various public and private lenders. Stanford University’s Jeremy Bulow and I have long argued that outright grants are cleaner than, and thus preferable to, lending instruments. So, what is to be done? For starters, the rich world needs to take the cost of vaccinations off the table for developing economies, in part by fully funding the multilateral COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access (COVAX) facility. The cost, in the billions of dollars, is paltry compared to the trillions that richer countries are spending to mitigate the pandemic’s impact on their own economies. Advanced economies should not only pay for the vaccines but also provide extensive subsidies and technical assistance in delivering them. For many reasons, not least that there will be another pandemic, this is a more effective solution than seizing intellectual property from vaccine developers. At the same time, advanced economies that are prepared to spend trillions of dollars on developing domestic green energy ought to be able to find a couple hundred billion per year to support the same transition in emerging markets. This assistance could be financed by carbon taxes, which ideally would be intermediated by a World Carbon Bank, a new global institution focused on helping developing countries to decarbonize. It is also important that developed economies remain open to global trade, the main factor behind lower inequality across countries. Governments should tackle inequality at home by expanding transfers and the social safety net, not by erecting trade barriers that disadvantage billions of people in Africa and Asia. And those people would also benefit from a significant expansion of the World Bank’s aid arm, the International Development Association. Addressing within-country inequality may be the political imperative of the moment.

            "帮助另外那66%的人 发自剑桥—发达国家近年民族主义情绪高涨的一个显著特点就是它发生在一个当今许多最紧迫挑战（包括气候变化和新冠肺炎疫情）从根本上都是需要全球解决方案的全球性问题的时期，而那些疫苗匮乏国的民众 — — 其实就是生活在发达经济体和中国之外的全球2/3人口 — — 所酝酿的愤怒可能很快会反过来困扰一众富裕国家。 美国总统拜登解决美国不平等问题的宏伟计划是值得欢迎的，但前提是政府能够通过增加税收或推高增长来支付其长期成本 — — 当然这两点能否实现还是未知之数。 规模较小但依旧重要的下一代欧盟计划（该计划旨在帮助意大利和西班牙等受疫情影响较大的欧盟成员国）也是如此。 生活在发达经济体中的那16%人经历了一场艰苦的疫情，如今正盼望着一场复苏，而拥有全球另外18%人口的中国则是第一个实现反弹的主要经济体，这主要归功于其更好的流行病准备工作和更强大的国家新冠病毒遏制能力。 那么其他人呢？ 正如国际货币基金组织4月发布的《世界经济展望》所强调的那样，全球当前存在着一个危险的分野。 骇人听闻的印度新冠爆发潮很可能是大部分发展中国家未来状况的预演 — — 那些地方的贫困率都出现了暴增。 至少在2022年年底前大多数国家都不太可能恢复到疫情前的产出水平。 直到最近，21世纪对发展中世界来说一直是个看似远比1980和1990年代更可能赶上发达国家的故事。 但当富裕国家忽然意识到遏制疫情和迫在眉睫的气候灾难在很大程度上取决于发展中经济体的努力时，新冠危机却已经袭击了那些较贫穷国家。 而在这个被疫情揭示的全球不平等现象激怒的世界里，遏制恐怖组织和无赖国家行为者所需的合作就更没法提了。 更糟糕的是，大部分发展中国家 — — 包括新兴市场 — — 是背负着急剧增长的外债进入这场疫情的。 隔夜货币政策利率在发达经济体中可能是零或负值，但在新兴市场和发展中经济体中平均高于4 % ， 而发展所需的那种长期借贷则成本更为高昂。 包括阿根廷、赞比亚和黎巴嫩在内一些国家已经违约。 当不均衡的复苏推高全球利率时，可能会有更多的国家出现违约。 因此那些较贫穷国家哪里有钱采购新冠疫苗和出台救济措施，更别提向绿色经济过渡了。 世界银行和国际货币基金组织都面临着寻找解决方案的巨大压力，但至少在解释这个问题方面做得很好。 然而这些组织都缺乏处理这种规模的挑战所需的财政结构。 新分配的特别提款权（国际货币基金组织的储备资产）可以在短期内有所帮助，但这一工具过于粗糙且设计不当，无法常规反复使用。 二战结束后成立的布雷顿森林机构主要作为贷款者而存在。 但正如富裕国家在疫情期间直接给本国公民打钱那样，发展中经济体也应该得到同样的待遇。 更高的债务只会加剧疫情后可能出现的违约状况，尤其考虑到确定各种公共和私人贷款者的偿付优先权方面所存在的困难。 对此斯坦福大学教授杰里米·布罗（Jeremy Bulow）和我长期以来一直认为直接赠款比贷款工具更干净利落，因此也更为可取。 那么该怎么做呢？ 首先，富国需要为发展中经济体免除疫苗接种费用，这在某种程度上可以通过为多边新冠肺炎疫苗实施计划（COVAX）提供全部资金来实现。 与富裕国家为减轻疫情对其自身经济影响而花费的数万亿美元相比，计划所需的数十亿美元费用简直微不足道。 先进经济体不仅应当支付疫苗费用，还得为疫苗的输送提供大范围补贴和技术援助。 考虑到许多原因，尤其是鉴于必将在未来爆发的下一场疫情，这将会是一个比从疫苗开发企业那里攫取知识产权更有效的解决方案。 与此同时，那些准备花费数万亿美元发展国内绿色能源的发达经济体应该能每年拿出几千亿美元支持新兴市场的同类转型。 这类援助资金可以通过碳税来筹集，且最好由世界碳银行这个专注于帮助发展中国家去碳化的新全球机构作为中介。 同样重要的是发达经济体应保持对全球贸易的开放姿态，因为这正是各国不平等状况得以收窄的主要因素。 各国政府解决国内不平等问题的手法应该是扩大转移支付和社会安全网，而不是设置一些使非洲和亚洲数十亿民众陷于不利地位的贸易壁垒。 同时这些民众也将从世界银行下属援助部门 — — 国际开发协会 — — 的大幅扩张中受益。 解决国家内部的不平等或许是眼下的政治需要，但消弭更为巨大的国家间差距才是21世纪维护地缘政治稳定局面的真正关键。"

            "America’s Global Election NEW YORK – Most people around the world will not be able to vote in the United States’s upcoming presidential election, even though they have a great deal at stake in the result. Overwhelmingly, non-US citizens favor Barack Obama’s re-election over a victory for his challenger, Mitt Romney. There are good reasons for this. In terms of the economy, the effects of Romney’s policies in creating a more unequal and divided society would not be directly felt abroad. But, in the past, for better and for worse, others have often followed America’s example. Many governments quickly subscribed to Ronald Reagan’s mantra of deregulated markets – policies that eventually brought about the worst global recession since the 1930’s. Other countries that followed America’s lead have experienced growing inequality – more money at the top, more poverty at the bottom, and a weaker middle class. Romney’s proposed contractionary policies – the attempt to reduce deficits prematurely, while the US economy is still frail – will almost surely weaken America’s already anemic growth, and, if the euro crisis worsens, it could bring on another recession. At that point, with US demand shrinking, the rest of the world would indeed feel the economic effects of a Romney presidency quite directly. That raises the question of globalization, which entails concerted action on many fronts by the international community. But what is required with regard to trade, finance, climate change, and a host other areas is not being done. Many people attribute these failures partly to an absence of American leadership. But, while Romney may summon bravado and strong rhetoric, other world leaders would be unlikely to follow him, owing to the belief (correct in my judgment) that he would take the US – and them – in the wrong direction. American “exceptionalism” may sell well at home, but it does poorly abroad. President George W. Bush’s Iraq war – arguably a violation of international law – showed that though America spends almost as much on defense as the rest of the world combined, it could not pacify a country with less than 10% of its population and less than 1% of its GDP. Moreover, it turned out that US-style capitalism was neither efficient nor stable. With most Americans’ incomes stagnating for a decade and a half, it was clear that the US economic model was not delivering for most citizens, whatever official GDP data said. Indeed, the model blew up even before Bush left office. Together with the abuses of human rights under his administration, the Great Recession – the predictable (and predicted) consequence of his economic policies – did as much to weaken America’s soft power as the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan did to weaken the credibility of its military power. In terms of values – namely, the values of Romney and his running mate, Paul Ryan – things are not much better. For example, every other advanced country recognizes the right to accessible health care, and Obama’s Affordable Care Act represents a significant step toward that goal. But Romney has criticized this effort, and has offered nothing in its place. America now has the distinction of being among the advanced countries that afford the least equality of opportunity to their citizens. And Romney’s drastic budget cutbacks, targeted at the poor and middle class, would further impede social mobility. At the same time, he would expand the military, spending more money on weapons that do not work against enemies that do not exist, enriching defense contractors like Halliburton at the expense of desperately needed public investment in infrastructure and education. While Bush is not on the ballot, Romney has not really distanced himself from the Bush administration’s policies. On the contrary, his campaign has featured the same advisers, the same devotion to higher military spending, the same belief that tax cuts for the rich are the solution to every economic problem, and the same fuzzy budget math. Consider, for example, the three issues that are at the center of the global agenda mentioned earlier: climate change, financial regulation, and trade. Romney has been silent on the first, and many in his party are “climate deniers.” The world cannot expect genuine leadership from Romney there. As for financial regulation, while the recent crisis has highlighted the need for stricter rules, agreement on many issues has proven to be elusive, partly because the Obama administration is too close to the financial sector. With Romney, though, there would be no distance at all: metaphorically speaking, he is the financial sector. One financial issue on which there is global agreement is the need to close down offshore bank havens, which exist mainly for purposes of tax evasion and avoidance, money laundering, and corruption. Money does not go to the Cayman Islands because sunshine makes it grow faster; this money thrives on the absence of sunshine. But, with Romney unapologetic about his own use of Cayman banks, we are unlikely to see progress even in this area. On trade, Romney promises to launch a trade war with China, and to declare it a currency manipulator on Day One – a promise that gives him little wiggle room. He refuses to note the renminbi’s large real appreciation in recent years, or to acknowledge that, while changes in China’s exchange rate may affect the bilateral trade deficit, what matters is America’s multilateral trade deficit. A stronger renminbi would simply mean a switch in the US from China to lower-cost producers of textiles, apparel, and other goods. The irony – again lost on Romney – is that other countries are accusing the US of currency manipulation. After all, one of the main benefits of the Federal Reserve’s policy of “quantitative easing” – perhaps the only channel with a significant effect on the real economy – derives from the depreciation of the US dollar. The world has a lot riding on America’s election. Unfortunately, most people who will be affected by it – almost the entire world – will have no influence on the outcome.",
            "关乎全球的美国选举 发自纽约 — — 世界上大部分人都无法在即将到来的美国总统大选上投票，尽管大选的结果与他们的利益息息相关。 相比米特·罗姆尼（Mitt Romney ） — —美国以外的大多数人更希望巴拉克·奥巴马（Barack Obama）能连任。 他们有充分的理由支持奥巴马而非罗姆尼。 就经济而言，美国之外的人们并不会直接感受到罗姆尼创造一个更不平等更分裂的社会政策所带来的影响。 然而一直以来，无论美国的做法是好是坏，其他国家通常都会争相效仿。 之前许多政府曾迅速追随美国前总统罗纳德·里根（Ronald Reagan）放松管制市场的口号 — — 这种政策最终酿成了自1930年代以来最严重的全球经济衰退。 其它以美国为榜样的国家都经历了日渐恶化的不平等状态 — — 富人越来越富有，穷人越来越穷困，而中产阶级的力量则日渐薄弱。 罗姆尼推荐主张经济紧缩的政策 — — 当美国经济仍然很虚弱时贸然试图降低赤字 — — 几乎必然会削弱美国本已乏力的增长，而且，如果欧元危机继续恶化，将会引发另一轮衰退。 到那时，随着美国需求萎缩，世界其他国家将真切而直接地感受到罗姆尼任总统所带来的经济效应。 这就引出了全球化的问题，全球化在许多方面都需要国际社会一致行动。 但在贸易、金融、气候变化以及许多其他领域上需要做的事情都没有实现。 很多人把这些失败在某种程度上归咎于缺乏美国的领导。 然而，尽管罗姆尼或许会发表强硬的言论甚至虚张声势，世界上其他领导人也不大可能会追随他，因为他们认为（依我判断这是正确的）罗姆尼将会把美国以及他们带往一个错误的方向。 美国“例外论”在其国内也许很得人心，但国外却不这么看。 前美国总统乔治·沃克·布什（George W. Bush）所发动的伊拉克战争 — — 可以说这违反了国际法 — — 显示了尽管美国国防支出几乎等于世界其他国家的总和，它也无法使一���人口只有其10 % ， GDP仅相当于其1%的国家屈服。 此外，事实证明美国式资本主义既没有效率也不稳定。 从大部分美国人的收入停滞了十五年的情况看来，不管官方的GDP数据怎么说，显然美国的经济模式并不能给大部分公民带来益处。 确实，这种模式的弊端甚至在小布什离任之前就显露出来了。 加上小布什政府对人权的滥用，经济大萧条 — — 这是布什经济政策可预见（确实被预测中了）的后果 — — 确实像伊拉克战争和阿富汗战争削弱了美国军事实力的可信度一样削弱了美国的软实力。 在价值观方面 — — 也就是罗姆尼和他的竞选伙伴保罗·瑞安（Paul Ryan）的价值观 — — 情况也不甚理想。 比如，所有其他的发达国家都承认其公民有获得价格合理医疗服务的权力，而奥巴马的可承担医疗法案（Affordable Care Act）则代表了朝该目标迈进的重要一步。 罗姆尼对此大加批判，但却未能提出任何可以替代这一法案的政策。 美国现在是给本国公民提供机会最不均等的发达国家之一。 而罗姆尼针对穷人和中产阶级的大幅预算削减政策会进一步阻碍社会流动性。 同时他还会扩大军队，花更多的钱在武器上 — — 这些武器并不会对不存在的敌人起到任何作用，只能使哈利伯顿（Halliburton）这类国防军工企业更加富有，而这是以牺牲急需政府投资的基础设施和教育为代价的。 虽然小布什没有参加竞选，罗姆尼却没有和小布什政府过去的政策划清界限。 相反，他的竞选活动使用同样的顾问团，同样致力于更高的军事支出，也怀着同样的信念 — — 即给富人减税是解决所有经济问题的办法，还有同样含糊不清的预算计算方法。 细想一下，比如之前提到的全球议程最关注的三个议题：气候变化、金融监管和贸易。 罗姆尼对第一个问题一直保持沉默，而他所在的共和党人很多人都“否认气候问题的存在 ” 。 在这个问题上，全世界都不用指望罗姆尼了。 至于金融监管，最近的危机凸显出人们需要制定更为严格的监管规则，然而在许多问题上所达成的协议被证明是逃避问题的，这一部分是由于奥巴马政府与财政部门过于亲近。 但对罗姆尼来说根本不存在距离的问题：形象地说，他本人就是财政部门。 一个全球已达成协议的金融问题就是需要关闭离岸银行这个避风港 — — 离岸银行的存在主要是为了避税漏税、洗钱和贪污。 钱流入开曼群岛并不是因为那里的阳光让这些钱增长得更快，这些钱本来就是在黑暗中积累出来的。 然而，罗姆尼自己就使用开曼银行，而且对此毫无悔意，我们也不大可能会看到他会在这方面有所作为。 在贸易方面，罗姆尼许诺要跟中国打一场贸易战，并在上任第一天就宣布其为汇率操纵国 — — 这把他逼到了墙角。 他拒绝关注这几年来人民币汇率的大幅度实际升值，或者说拒绝承认虽然中国的汇率变化可能会影响双边贸易逆差，但更重要的其实是美国的多边贸易逆差。 人民币走强直接意味着纺织品，服装和其他商品的低成本制造国从中国变成了美国。 讽刺的是 — — 这依然无法引起罗姆尼的注意 — — 其他国家正谴责在美国操纵汇率。 毕竟，美联储的量化宽松政策的其中一个主要好处 — — 也许是唯一一个能对实体经济产生重大影响的渠道 — — 就来自于美元的贬值。 美国的总统大选对整个世界来说影响都很大。 不幸地是，大部分即将受到该选举影响的人 — — 几乎是整个世界 — — 对结果却没有任何的影响力。"

            "Boris Johnson’s Fall – and Ours LONDON – Nearly all political careers end in failure, but Boris Johnson is the first British prime minister to be toppled for scandalous behavior. That should worry us. The three most notable downfalls of twentieth-century British leaders were caused by political factors. Neville Chamberlain was undone by his failed appeasement policy. The Suez fiasco forced Anthony Eden to resign in 1957. And Margaret Thatcher fell in 1990 because popular resistance to the poll tax persuaded Tory MPs that they could not win again with her as leader. True, Harold Macmillan was undone in 1963 by the Profumo sex scandal, but this involved a secretary of state for war and possible breaches of national security. Election defeats following economic failure brought down Edward Heath and James Callaghan in the 1970s. Tony Blair was forced to resign by the Iraq debacle and Gordon Brown’s impatience to succeed him. David Cameron was skewered by Brexit, and Theresa May by her failure to deliver Brexit. No such events explain Johnson’s fall. David Lloyd George, a much greater leader than Johnson, is his only serious rival in sleaze. But though the sale of seats in the House of Lords, slipshod administrative methods, and dishonesty had weakened Lloyd George, the immediate cause of his fall (exactly a century ago) was his mishandling of the Chanak crisis, which brought Britain and Turkey to the brink of war. The more familiar comparison is with US President Richard Nixon. Every Johnson misdemeanor is routinely labeled “gate” after the Watergate break-in that ended Nixon. John Maynard Keynes called Lloyd George a “crook”; Nixon famously denied that he was one. Neither they nor Johnson were crooks in the technical sense (of being convicted of crimes), but Nixon would have been impeached in 1974 had he not resigned, and Johnson was fined £50 for breaking lockdown rules. Moreover, all three showed contempt for the laws they were elected to uphold, and for the norms of conduct expected from public officials. We struggle to describe their character flaws: “unprincipled,” “amoral,” and “serial liar” seem to capture Johnson. But they describe more successful political leaders as well. To explain his fall, we need to consider two factors specific to our times. The first is that we no longer distinguish personal qualities from political qualities. Nowadays, the personal really is political: personal failings are ipso facto political failings. Gone is the distinction between the private and the public, between subjective feeling and objective reality, and between moral and religious matters and those that government must address. Politics has crossed into the realm previously occupied by psychiatry. This was bound to happen once affluence undermined the old class basis of politics. Questions of personal identity arising from race, gender, sexual preference, and so on now dominate the spaces vacated by the politics of distribution. Redressing discrimination, not addressing inequality, became the task of politics. Johnson is both a creature and a victim of identity politics. His rhetoric was about “leveling up” and “our National Health Service.” But, in practice, he made his personality the content of his politics. No previous British leaders would have squandered their moral capital on trivial misdemeanors and attempted cover-ups, because they knew that it had to be kept in reserve for momentous events. But momentous events are now about oneself, so when a personality is seen as flawed, there is no other story to tell. Johnson’s personality-as-politics was also the creation of the media. In the past, newspapers, by and large, reported the news; now, focusing on personalities, they create it. This change has given rise to a corrupt relationship: personalities use the media to promote themselves, and the media expose their frailties to sell copy. There has always been a large market for sexual and financial gossip. But even in the old “yellow press,” there was a recognized sphere of public events that took priority. Now the gossip stories are the public events. This development has radically transformed public perceptions about the qualities a political leader should have. Previous generations of political leaders were by no means all prudes. They lied, drank, fornicated, and took bribes. But everyone concerned with politics recognized that it was important to protect the public sphere. Leaders’ moral failings were largely shielded from scrutiny, unless they became egregious. And even when the public became aware of them, they were forgiven, provided the leaders delivered the goods politically. Most of the offenses that led to Johnson’s resignation would never have been reported in the past. But today the doctrine of personal accountability justifies stripping political leaders naked. Every peccadillo, every lapse from correct expression, becomes a credibility-destroying “disgrace” or “shame.” People’s ability to operate in the public sphere depends on privacy. Once that is gone, their ability to act effectively when they need to vanishes. The other new factor is that politics is no longer viewed as a vocation so much as a stepping stone to money. Media obsession with what a political career is worth, rather than whether politicians are worthy of their jobs, is bound to affect what politically ambitious people expect to achieve and the public’s view of what to expect from them. Blair is reported to have amassed millions in speaking engagements and consultancies since leaving office. In keeping with the times, The Times has estimated how much money Johnson could earn from speaking fees and book deals, and how much more he is worth than May. In his resignation speech, Johnson sought to defend the “best job in the world” in traditional terms, while criticizing the “eccentricity” of being removed in mid-delivery of his promises. But this defense of his premiership sounded insincere, because his career was not a testimony to his words. The cause of his fall was not just his perceived lack of morality, but also his perceived lack of a political compass. For Johnson, the personal simply exposed the hollowness of the political.",
            "论鲍里斯·约翰逊和我们的倒掉 伦敦—几乎所有的政治生涯都以失败告终，但鲍里斯·约翰逊是第一位因丑闻而被推翻的英国首相。 这应该让我们担心。 20 世纪英国领导人的三次最引人注目的垮台由政治因素造成。 张伯伦倒台是因为绥靖政策的失败。 苏伊士的惨败迫使伊登在 1957 年辞职。 撒切尔夫人1990 年倒台使因为民众对人头税的抵制使保守党议员相信，在她担任领导人的情况下保守但无法再次获胜。 诚然，麦克米兰在 1963 年因 Profumo 性丑闻而下台，但这涉及支持战争的国务卿和可能危及到国家安全的情况。 经济失败后的选举失利导致了 1970 年代希思和卡拉汉的倒台。 布莱尔因伊拉克危机以及布朗急于接替他而被迫辞职。 卡梅伦被英国脱欧拖下了水，而梅的失败则是因为她未能实现脱欧所困扰。 没有这样的事件可以解释约翰逊的倒掉。 劳埃德·乔治，比约翰逊伟大得多的领袖，是唯一在倒台的问题上堪与约翰逊相比者。 但是，尽管出售上议院席位、草率的行政方式，以及不诚实削弱了劳埃德·乔治，但他垮台的直接原因（正好在约翰逊整整一个世纪前）是他对恰纳克危机的处理不当，这场危机将英国和土耳其带到了战争边缘。 更熟悉的比较是美国总统尼克松。 约翰逊的每一项罪名，都会被冠以让尼克松下台的水门事件的“门”之名。 约翰·梅纳·德凯恩斯称劳埃德·乔治为“骗子 ” ； 尼克松决然否认他是骗子。 他们和约翰逊都不是技术意义上的骗子（被判有罪 ） ， 但如果尼克松不辞职，将在 1974 年被弹劾，约翰逊因违反封锁规则而被罚款 50 英镑。 此外，这三人都有蔑视他们被选出来捍卫的法律，以及违反公职人员应有的规范的行为。 我们很难描述他们的性格缺陷：约翰逊几乎坐实了“没有原则 ” 、 “不道德”和“连环骗子 ” 。 但这些词也可以用来描述了成功的政治领导人。 为了解释他的倒掉，我们需要考虑两个特定于我们时代的因素。 首先是我们不再区分个人品质和政治品质。 如今，个人其实就是政治：个人的失败是事实上的政治失败。 私人与公共、主观感受与客观现实、以及道德和宗教问题与政府必须解决的问题之间的区别已经一去不复返了。 政治已经进入了以前的精神病学领域。 一旦富足破坏了旧政治的阶级基础，必然就会发生这种事情。 由种族、性别、性偏好等引起的个人身份问题，现在主导着分配政治所腾出的空间。 纠正歧视，而不是解决不平等，成为政治的任务。 约翰逊既是身份政治的产物，也是身份政治的受害者。 他的言论是关于“升级”和“我们的国民健康服务局 ” 。 但在实践中，他让他的人格成为他的政治的内容。 以前的英国领导人不会将他们的道德资本浪费在微不足道的轻罪和企图掩盖事实上，因为他们知道必须留着用在重大事件上。 但现在重大事件是关于自己的，所以当人格被视为有缺陷，就没有其他故事可讲了。 约翰逊的人格政治也是媒体的创造。 过去，报纸大体上只报道新闻。 现在，则专注于人格，他们创造了它。 这种变化导致了一种腐败的关系：人格利用媒体来宣传自己，而媒体则曝光人格的弱点作为卖点。 性和财务流言一向很有市场。 但即使在旧的“花边小报”中，也有一个公认的优先考虑的公共事件领域。 现在，流言就是公共事件。 这一发展从根本上改变了公众对政治领导人应具备的素质的看法。 前几代的政治领导人都不是完人。 他们撒谎、酗酒、通奸、收受贿赂。 但是每个关心政治的人都认识到保护公共领域很重要。 领导者的道德缺陷在很大程度上不受审查，除非离谱到令人震惊。 即使公众知道了领导者的道德缺陷，也会原谅，只要领导人交出政治答卷。 大多数导致约翰逊辞职的罪行过去都不会被报道。 但今天，个人责任原则意味着让政治领导人“裸奔”乃应有之义。 每一次小过失，每一次偏离正确表达，都会成为破坏公信力的“耻辱”或“耻辱 ” 。 人们在公共领域的运作能力取决于隐私。 一旦隐私消失，他们在需要时有效行动的能力也随之消失。 另一个新因素是，政治不再被视为一种职业，而是金钱的垫脚石。 媒体痴迷于政治生涯的价值，而不是政客是否配得上他们的工作，这势必会影响有政治抱负的人的期望，以及公众对他们的期望。 据报道，布莱尔自离任以来已经通过演讲活动和咨询服务赚了几百万。 与时俱进的《泰晤士报》估计了约翰逊可以从演讲费和图书合同中赚到多少钱，以及他的身价比梅高多少。 在他的辞职演讲中，约翰逊试图用传统话语捍卫“世界上最好的工作 ” ， 同时批评在兑现承诺中途被撤职的“反常 ” 。 但如此为他的首相生涯辩护听起来很不真诚，因为他的职业生涯与他所说的这些话并不相符。 他倒台的原因不仅是他认为缺乏道德，也是他认为缺乏政治罗盘。 对于约翰逊来说，个人只是暴露了政治的空洞。"

            "The Battle Cry of the Non-Oppressed TEL AVIV – Nobody should be surprised that Scotland’s recent referendum on independence left the United Kingdom intact. In the past, regions or communities have achieved statehood almost exclusively after a struggle against colonial subjection and oppression, galvanized by an appeal to a distinctive religious, cultural, or ethnic identity. Complaints about economic dynamics, social policies, or governance inefficiencies – the basis of Scotland’s “yes” campaign – are not the cris de coeur of a successful independence movement. That is bad news for secessionists elsewhere in the West. Of course, Scotland’s technocratic nationalism made sense. As the movement’s leader, Alex Salmond, acknowledged in a 2012 consultation document, “Scotland is not oppressed and we have no need to be liberated.” The struggle for independence, he explained, was aimed at creating the kind of efficient administrative and economic structures that would enable Scotland to reach its potential. The “yes” campaign hoped to win supporters with a utopian vision of an independent Scotland that included European Union and NATO membership; a currency union with England, but no fiscal union; improved public services and social benefits; and lower taxes. In other words, Scotland would have everything it has now, only better, and on its own terms. This vision was undoubtedly appealing to many Scots. But it proved significantly less compelling than the economic doomsday scenarios advanced by its unionist opponents, including former US Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, former World Bank President Robert Zoellick, and Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne. In other words, many people’s votes were driven by risk aversion, fear, and intimidation, rather than hope, passion, or deep emotional attachment to a common identity. This contrasts sharply with the motivations espoused by Scotland’s nobles in the fourteenth century, when they succeeded in preserving their country’s independence from English rule. “It is in truth not for glory, nor riches, nor honors that we are fighting,” they declared, “but for freedom alone, which no honest man gives up but with life itself.” In fact, the “no” campaign’s victory might have been even more resounding if the Westminster establishment’s desperate, last-minute offer to grant Scotland more powers on taxation, spending, and welfare had been included as an option in the ballot. National movements driven by a historical mission or an uncompromising quest to assert group identity against a dominant power normally do not succumb to economic considerations and last-minute economic bait. It was none other than the founder of the Zionist fundamentalist right, Ze’ev Jabotinsky, who warned in 1924 against “the naive assumption that the aspiration of the Palestinians…will be paralyzed by such means as subsidies, economic advantages, or bribery.” Recognizing that their “natural patriotism is pure and noble,” he knew that they could not be “bought off.” Now, Salmond is probably re-thinking his avoidance of nativist identity politics. What Edmund Burke defined as a group’s attachment to “the inns and resting places of the human spirit” – that is, ethnic, religious, and community ties – would have been a much more powerful mobilizing force for an independence movement. The “yes” campaigners would not have had to look far for inspiration. James Joyce – himself not devoid of traces of Irish nationalism – wrote that “nationality, language, [and] religion” are “the nets” into which “a man is born.” Similarly, George Orwell distinguished between Celtic nationalism and Anglophobia, stating that the former is belief “in the past and future greatness of the Celtic peoples.” True, Scotland’s great minds in the age of Enlightenment, such as David Hume, Adam Smith, and even the national poet, Robert Burns, were all fervent advocates of “Britishness,” whatever that might mean today. Yet an identity-based campaign could have resorted to the heritage of the Scottish Renaissance of the mid-twentieth century or to the Celtic Revival and Celtic Twilight movements, which awakened a spirit of cultural nationalism among Scots in the late nineteenth century. In the run-up to the referendum, Scotland’s independence movement became an important point of reference for Catalans and Basques in Spain, the Flemish in Belgium, the Veneto and South Tyrol regions in Italy, Corsicans and Bretons in France, and the secessionists of Quebec. All hoped that Scotland would pave the way for the peaceful breakup of their own states. With the defeat of Scotland’s independence movement – not to mention Québécois voters’ stunning rejection of the province’s largest separatist party in last April’s election – that hope may be waning. And with good reason. There is little historical precedent for the peaceful breakup of a state, with an exception like Czechoslovakia’s consensual split in 1993 occurring in unique circumstances. A state is far more likely to go to war to defend its unity. The United States and Spain did it in their civil wars, and today’s Spain would go to the outer limits of its capacity to prevent a Catalan or Basque referendum, let alone independence. Nationalist groups in Western democracies are not subjugated people. Theirs is the nationalism of free, liberated people, who can expect the most generous devolution deals possible to protect their singular legacies and address their grievances. And perhaps that is why federal arrangements like those in Australia and Canada – essentially what Westminster grudgingly offered Scotland – could be their best option.",
            "未受压迫者的战争号角 特拉维夫—苏格兰最近的独立公投的最终结果是英国安然无恙，这本不令人奇怪。 在过去，地区或社会建国成功几乎清一色是依靠反殖民统治和压迫的斗争，推动力量往往是独特的宗教、文化或种族身份诉求。 关于经济活力、社会政策或治理低效的怨气 — — 苏格兰对独立说“是”的阵营的基础就在于此 — — 从未唤起过成功的独立运动。 对西方的其他分裂主义者来说，这是个坏消息。 当然，苏格兰的技术官僚民族主义有其意义。 独立运动领导人亚历克斯·萨尔蒙德（Alex Salmond）在2012 的咨文中承认 ， “ 苏格兰没有受到压迫，我们不需要被解放 。 ” 他解释说，独立斗争的目标是建立高效的行政和经济结构，以使苏格兰实现潜力。 “是”阵营希望凭借一个拥有欧盟和北约成员资格的独立的苏格兰、一个和英格兰一起构成的货币而非财政的联盟、改善的公共服务和社会福利以及更低的税收这一乌托邦前景赢得支持者。 换句话说，独立后的苏格兰将拥有现在所拥有的一切，只会更好，不会更差。 这一前景毫无疑问吸引了大量苏格兰人。 但显然它远远敌不过包括前美联储主席艾伦·格林斯潘、前世界银行行长罗伯特·佐利克和前财政大臣乔治·奥斯本在内的统一主义反对派所宣扬的经济末日情景。 换句话说，许多人的投票受风险厌恶、恐惧和威胁的驱动，而不是受希望、激情或对共同身份的深刻情感归属的驱动。 这与十四世纪苏格兰贵族所发动的运动截然相反。 当时，他们成功地捍卫了国家脱离英格兰统治的独立性。 “事实上，我们的斗争不是为了光荣、富有或荣耀 ， ” 他们说 ， “ 而只是为了自由，没有哪个诚实的人会放弃自由 。 ” 事实上，如果英国当局最后时刻授予苏格兰更大的征税、支出和福利权力的争取姿态一开始就包括在投票选项中的话 ， “ 不”阵营的胜利还会更加辉煌。 受历史使命或面对主宰势力主张群体身份的不可妥协的要求驱动的国家运动通常不会屈从于经济考虑或最后时刻的经济诱惑。 原教旨锡安主义右派创始人杰伊夫·亚博金斯基（Ze’ev Jabotinsky）在1924年警告说 ， “ 巴勒斯坦人的雄心 … … 可以通过补贴、经济进步或自由这样的办法消磨，这样的想法是幼稚的 。 ” 他意识到巴勒斯坦人“纯粹而高贵的天生的爱国主义 ” ， 明白他们不可能被“收买 ” 。 如今，萨尔蒙德或许在反思他回避本土身份政治的做法。 埃德蒙·伯克（Edmund Burke）所定义的一个群体对“人类精神的栖身之所 ” — —即种族、宗教和社会联系 — — 的依恋将永远是更有力得多的独立运动动员力。 “是”阵营本不需要辛苦寻找灵感。 詹姆斯·乔伊斯（James Joyce ） — —他本人并未摆脱爱尔兰民族主义痕迹 — — 写道 ， “ 国籍、语言 、 [ 和]宗教”是“人类诞生”于其中的“网 ” 。 类似地，乔治·奥威尔（George Orwell）区分凯尔特民族主义者和仇英心理，指出前者是对“凯尔特民族过去和未来的伟大”的信念。 诚然，启蒙时代苏格兰的伟大思想家 — — 如大卫·休谟、亚当·斯密乃至于国民诗人罗伯特·彭斯（Robert Burns ） — —无不是“英国性”的强烈支持者，不管今天这可能意味着什么。 但基于身份的运动本可以诉诸于二十世纪中叶的苏格兰复兴（Scottish Renaissance）或在19世纪末唤醒了苏格兰人文化民族主义精神的凯尔特复兴和凯尔特曙光（Celtic Revival and Celtic Twilight）等运动。 在通往公投的过程中，苏格兰独立运动成为西班牙加泰罗尼亚人和巴斯克人、比利时弗朗芒人、意大利威尼托（Veneto）和南蒂罗尔（South Tyrol）地区、法国科西嘉人和布列塔尼人以及魁北克分裂分子的重要参照点。 他们无不希望苏格兰能为他们自身的建国开辟一条和平分裂之路。 苏格兰独立运动失败了 — — 更不用说去年4月魁北克省选举中选民一边倒地拒绝了最大的分裂主义政党 — — 这一希望也随之落空。 理应如此。 国家和平分裂的先例极少，捷克斯洛伐克1993年的自愿分裂只是例外，需要相当独特的环境才能发生。 更有可能的是国家发动战争捍卫统一。 美国和西班牙的内战都是如此，今天的西班牙也会竭尽全力阻止加泰罗尼亚或巴斯克公投，更不用说独立了。 西方民主国家的民族主义群体并非被征服者。 他们是自由的民族主义、被解放的人民，大可期待获得最慷慨的放权保护他们独特的遗产、消弭他们的仇恨。 也许正因如此，澳大利亚和加拿大等国家的联邦制度可以成为他们的最佳选择 — — 英国不情愿地向苏格兰所做的让步亦然。"

            "Long Live China’s Slowdown NEW HAVEN – At 7.7%, China’s annual GDP growth in the first quarter of this year was slower than many expected. While the data were hardly devastating relative to a consensus forecast of 8.2%, many (including me) expected a second consecutive quarterly rebound from the slowdown that appeared to have ended in the third quarter of 2012. China doubters around the world were quick to pounce on the number, expressing fears of a stall, or even a dreaded double dip. But slower GDP growth is actually good for China, provided that it reflects the long-awaited structural transformation of the world’s most dynamic economy. The broad outlines of this transformation are well known – a shift from export- and investment-led growth to an economic structure that draws greater support from domestic private consumption. Less well known is that a rebalanced China should have a slower growth rate – the first hints of which may now be evident. A rebalanced China can grow more slowly for one simple reason: By drawing increased support from services-led consumer demand, China’s new model will embrace a more labor-intensive growth recipe. The numbers seem to bear that out. China’s services sector requires about 35% more jobs per unit of GDP than do manufacturing and construction – the primary drivers of the old model. That number has potentially huge implications, because it means that China could grow at an annual rate in the 7-8% range and still achieve its objectives with respect to employment and poverty reduction. China has struggled to attain these goals with anything less than 10% growth, because the old model was not generating enough jobs per unit of output. As Chinese manufacturing moved up the value chain, firms increasingly replaced workers with machines embodying the latest technologies. As a result, its economic model spawned a labor-saving, capital-intensive growth dynamic. On one level, that made sense. Capital-labor substitution is at the heart of modern productivity strategies for manufacturing-based economies. But it left China in a deepening hole: increasingly deficient in jobs per unit of output, it needed more units of output to absorb its surplus labor. Ultimately, that became more of a problem than a solution. The old manufacturing model, which fueled an unprecedented 20-fold increase in per capita income relative to the early 1990’s, also sowed the seeds of excessive resource consumption and environmental degradation. Services-led growth is, in many ways, the antidote to the “unstable, unbalanced, uncoordinated, and ultimately unsustainable” growth model that former Premier Wen Jiabao’s famously criticized in 2007. Yet services offer more than just a labor-intensive growth path. Compared to manufacturing, they have much smaller resource and carbon footprints. A services-led model provides China with an alternative, environmentally friendlier, and ultimately more sustainable economic structure. It is premature, of course, to conclude that a services-led transformation to slower growth is now at hand. The latest data hint at such a possibility, with the tertiary sector (services) expanding at an 8.3% annual rate in the first quarter of this year – the third consecutive quarter of acceleration and a half-percentage point faster than the 7.8% first-quarter gain recorded by the secondary sector (manufacturing and construction). But it will take more than a few quarters of mildly encouraging data to validate such an important shift in the Chinese economy’s underlying structure. Not surprisingly, China skeptics are putting a different spin on the latest growth numbers. Fears of a shadow-bank-induced credit bubble now top the worry list, reinforcing longstanding concerns that China may succumb to the dreaded “middle-income trap” – a sustained growth slowdown that has ensnared most high-growth emerging economies at the juncture that China has now reached. China is hardly immune to such a possibility. But it is unlikely to occur if China can carry out the services-led pro-consumption rebalancing that remains the core strategic initiative of its current (12th) Five-Year Plan. Invariably, the middle-income trap afflicts those emerging economies that cling to early-stage development models for too long. For China, the risk will be highest if it sticks with the timeworn recipe of unbalanced manufacturing- and construction-led growth, which has created such serious sustainability problems. If China fails to rebalance, weak external demand from a crisis-battered developed world will continue to hobble its export machine, forcing it to up the ante on a credit- and investment-led growth model – in effect, doubling down on resource-intensive and environmentally damaging growth. But I remain hopeful that China’s new leadership team will move quickly to implement its new model. There are no viable alternatives. Financial markets, as well as growth-starved developed economies, are not thrilled with the natural rhythm of slower growth that a rebalanced Chinese economy is likely to experience. Resource industries – indeed, resource-based economies like Australia, Canada, Brazil, and Russia – have become addicted to China’s old strain of unsustainable hyper-growth. Yet China knows that it is time to break that dangerous habit. The United States is likely to have a different problem with consumer-led growth in China. After all, higher private consumption implies an end to China’s surplus saving – and thus to the seemingly open-ended recycling of that surplus into dollar-based assets such as US Treasury bills. Who will then fund America’s budget deficit – and on what terms? Just as China must embrace slower growth as a natural consequence of its rebalancing imperative, the rest of the world will need to figure out how to cope when it does.",
            "中国经济放缓万岁 发自纽黑文 — — 今年第一季度中国7.7%的年GDP增长率比很多人预计的要缓慢得多。 虽然这一数据相对普遍8.2%的预测来说并不是灾难性的，但很多人（包括我）都预计这次放缓 — — 这种放缓似乎在2012年第三季度就已经结束了 — — 后出现连续性的二次反弹。 而世界各地的中国怀疑论者则迅速针对这一数据大做文章，担心经济停滞甚至出现可怕的二次衰退。 但假如能反映出全世界最活跃的经济体已经出现期待已久的结构性改革的话，较为缓慢的GDP增长对中国来说就是件好事。 这个改革的大轮廓是众所周知的 — — 即从出口及投资导向型经济增长向由更多国内个人消费支撑的经济结构过渡。 更不为人所知的是重新平衡后的中国增长率应该更低 — — 其第一批暗示迹象如今已经成为了现实。 重新调整过的中国会因为一个简单的原因而增长得更慢：即通过不断拉动服务主导的消费者需求，中国的新模式将会迎来一个更加劳动密集型的增长模式。 这些数据似乎证实了这一点。 中国的服务业每创造一个单位的GDP要比制造业和建筑业 — — 这是旧模式中最主要的驱动力 — — 所需的劳动要多35 % 。 这个数据有着潜在的巨大影响，它意味着中国能以7-8%的年增长率增长，同时还能实现提升就业和降低贫困率的目标。 中国一直奋力在10%的增长率之上实现这些目标，因为旧模式每个单位的产出并不能产生足够的工作岗位。 由于中国制造业不断向价值链的上端移动，公司也不断地用最先进的机器来取代工人。 因此其经济模式催生了一个节省劳力，资本密集型的增长模式。 从某个程度说，这是说得通的。 对以制造业为主的经济体来说，资本替代劳力是现代生产力的核心策略。 但这让中国陷入了难以自拔的泥潭：每单位产出所提供的工作岗位越来越少，这就需要更多的产出来吸收多余的劳力。 最终，这会成为一个问题而不是解决方案。 旧的生产模式在上世纪90年代初期推动了前所未有的人均收入20倍的增长，同时也埋下了过度消耗资源和环境退化的隐患。 服务导向型增长从很多方面来说都能解决“不稳定、不平衡、不协调并最终不可持续”的增长模式 — — 众所周知前总理温家宝批评过这一模式。 然而服务业提供的不仅是劳动密集的增长路径。 相对制造业，它们使用的能源更少，碳排放量也低。 服务导向的模式给中国提供了一种选择，对环境更有益，最终而言也是一种更可持续的经济结构。 当然，由此就断言很快服务业就会导致增长更缓慢还为时过早。 最新的数据暗示了这种可能性，第三产业（即服务业）在今年第一季度以8.3%的速度扩张 — — 这是其连续第三个季度的加速并比第二产业第一季度（制造业和建筑业）7.8%的增长率高出半个百分点。 但是要证明中国经济发生了根本结构的改变还需要多几个季度的数据来支撑。 然而不出所料，中国怀疑论者也对最新的增长数据赋予了完全不同的意义。 他们现在最担忧影子银行会引发信贷泡沫，这又让强化了他们一直以来的担忧：中国可能会掉入可怕的“中等收入陷阱 ” — —这是一种很多高增长新兴经济体在发展到中国这个阶段都面对过的持续增长放缓。 中国几乎不大可能避免这种可能性。 但���果中国能进行服务主导消费导向的调整 — — 这仍然是中国当前（第十二个）五年计划的核心战略，这种情况就不大可能会发生。 不变地是，中等收入陷阱会折磨那些过分长期依赖初级阶段发展模式的新兴经济体。 对中国来说，如果它继续其过时且不平衡的制造业和建筑业主导增长模式 — — 这已经导致了非常严重的可持续性问题，那么它就很有可能掉进这一陷阱。 如果中国无法成功调整，发达国家饱受危机冲击的疲软外部需求将会持续遏制其出口机器，迫使它在信贷和投资主导的增长模式上押更多的赌注 — — 实际上就会加倍进行资源密集和伤害环境的增长。 但我依旧对中国新的领导班子很快实施新模式保持乐观。 因为他们并没有什么切实可行的替代方案。 金融市场，以及缺乏增长的发达国家，并不喜欢调整后的中国经济可能要经历的增长放缓。 资源产业 — — 事实上像澳大利亚、加拿大、巴西和俄罗斯这些资源型经济体 — — 都已经过度依赖中国过去那种不可持续的高速增长张力。 然而中国自知是时候要破除这一危险习惯了。 很有可能中国的消费者主导增长模式对美国来说会成为一个问题。 毕竟更高的私人消费意味着中国的储蓄盈余时代走向终结 — — 从而也不能再无限循环利用这种盈余转化为美元资产，比如美国国库券。 那么谁又能为美国的预算赤字提供资金 — — 其条件又会是什么呢？ 正如中国必须接受较慢的增长作为其势在必行调整的结果，世界其他各国也需要找到应对这一状况的手段。"

            "Why Small Booms Cause Big Busts BERKELEY – As bubbles go, it was not a very big one. From 2002 to 2006, the share of the American economy devoted to residential construction rose by 1.2 percentage points of GDP above its previous trend value, before plunging as the United States entered the greatest economic crisis in nearly a century. According to my rough calculations, the excess investment in the housing sector during this period totaled some $500 billion – by any measure a tiny fraction of the world economy at the time of the crash. The resulting damage, however, has been enormous. The economies of Europe and North America are roughly 6% smaller than we would have expected them to be had there been no crisis. In other words, a relatively small amount of overinvestment is responsible for some $1.8 trillion in lost production every year. Given that the gap shows no signs of closing, and accounting for expected growth rates and equity returns, I estimate that the total loss to production will eventually reach nearly $3 quadrillion. For each dollar of overinvestment in the housing market, the world economy will have suffered $6,000 in losses. How can this be? It is important to note that not all recessions cause so much pain. Financial blows in 1987, 1991, 1997, 1998, and 2001 (when some $4 trillion of excess investment was lost when the dot-com bubble burst) had little impact on the broader real economy. The reason why things were different this time can be found in a recently published paper by Òscar Jordà, Moritz Schularick, and Alan M. Taylor. Large credit booms, the authors show, can greatly worsen the damage caused by the collapse of an asset bubble. Historically, when a recession is caused by the collapse of an asset bubble that was not fueled by a credit boom, the economy is roughly 1-1.5% below what it otherwise would have been five years after the start of the downturn. When a credit boom is involved, however, the damage is significantly greater. When the bubble is in equity prices, the economy performs 4% below par, on average, after five years – and as much as 9% below par when the bubble is in the housing market. Given these findings, it is clear that the distress experienced since the beginning of the economic crisis is not far out of line with historical experience. For many economists, recessions are an inevitable part of the business cycle – the bust that necessarily follows, like a hangover, from any boom. John Maynard Keynes, however, had little time for this view. “It seems an extraordinary imbecility that this wonderful outburst of productive energy should be the prelude to impoverishment and depression,” Keynes wrote in 1931, after the boom years of the 1920s had given way to the Great Depression. “I find the explanation of the current business losses, of the reduction in output, and of the unemployment which necessarily ensues on this not in the high level of investment which was proceeding up to the spring of 1929, but in the subsequent cessation of this investment.” A few years later, Keynes proposed a fix to the problem. In The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money, Keynes explained how booms are created when “investments which will in fact yield, say, 2% in conditions of full employment are made in the expectation of a yield of, say, 6% and are valued accordingly.” In a recession, the problem is flipped. Investments that would yield 2% are “expected to yield less than nothing.” The result is a self-fulfilling prophecy, in which widespread unemployment does indeed drive the returns of those investments below zero. “We reach a condition where there is a shortage of houses,” Keynes wrote, “but where nevertheless no one can afford to live in the houses that there are.” His solution was simple: “The right remedy for the trade cycle is not to be found in abolishing booms and thus keeping us permanently in a semi-slump; but in abolishing slumps and thus keeping us permanently in a quasi-boom.” For Keynes, the underlying problem was a failure of the economy’s credit channels. The financial reaction to the collapse of a bubble and the resulting wave of bankruptcies drives the natural rate of interest below zero, even though there are still many ways to put people productively to work. Today, we recognize that clogged credit channels can cause an economic downturn. There are three commonly proposed responses. The first is expansionary fiscal policies, with governments taking up the slack in the face of weak private investment. The second is a higher inflation target, giving central banks more room to respond to financial shocks. And the third is tight restrictions on debt and leverage, especially in the housing market, in order to prevent a credit-fueled price bubble from forming. To these solutions, Keynes would have added a fourth, one known to us today as the “Greenspan put” – using monetary policy to validate the asset prices reached at the height of the bubble. Unfortunately, in a world in which fiscal austerity appears to exert a mesmerizing hold over politicians, and in which a 2% inflation target seems set in stone, our policy options are rather limited. And that, ultimately, is how a relatively small boom can lead to such a large bust.",
            "为何小泡沫会造成大萧条 发自伯克利 — — 当泡沫膨胀时，其规模还不算太大。 在随美国遭遇近一个世纪以来最严重经济危机而暴跌之前的2002~2006年间，经济中住宅建筑占GDP的份额仅比先前的趋势值高出了1.2 % 。 据笔者的粗略计算，这一时期住房领域的过度投资总额约为5000亿美元 — — 无论怎样计算，都不过崩溃时世界经济总规模的一小部分而已。 然而因此造成的损失却是巨大的。 欧洲及北美各经济体比预期无危机的情况萎缩了6 % 。 换句话说，相对少量的过度投资竟然导致了每年约1.8万亿美元的GDP损失。 鉴于跌幅尚未出现收窄的迹象，我估计包括预期增长率和股本回报率在内，GDP总损失最终将达到近3000万亿美元。 意味着每1美元的房地产市场过度投资会令世界经济遭受6000美元的损失。 这是怎么回事？ 需要特别注意的是，并非所有的经济衰退都会造成如此严重的痛苦。 比如1987，1991，1997，1998和2001年（当时网络泡沫破灭，4万亿美元的过度投资也打了水漂）的金融冲击就对更广泛的实体经济影响不大。 而为什么这次情况会不同则可在奥斯卡·乔达（Òscar Jordà ） 、 莫利兹·舒拉里克（Moritz Schularick ） 、 艾伦M·泰勒（Alan M. Taylor）最近发表的论文里找到答案。 在这篇论文中作者指出，大规模的信贷繁荣会大大加重资产泡沫崩溃造成的破坏。 从历史上看，当经济衰退因并非由信贷繁荣推动的资产泡沫所引发时，在衰退开始的五年后经济要比无衰退情况下缩减1~1.5 % 。 一旦由信贷繁荣所推动则破坏会明显扩大。 当泡沫体现在股价上时，衰退五年后经济的表现平均低于标准值4 % 。 当泡沫体现在房产市场时，这个数值将会达到9 % 。 有见及此，很显然自经济危机开始以来的惨痛经历也与历史经验不相上下。 在许多经济学家看来，衰退是经济周期不可避免的一部分 — — 无论任何繁荣，随后的爆破是必然的，就像痛饮之后的宿醉。 然而约翰·梅纳德·凯恩斯（John Maynard Keynes）并不认同这一观点 ， “ 将生产能力的巨大膨胀视为贫困和衰退的必然前奏是非常愚蠢的 ， ” 凯恩斯在1920年代经济繁荣转向大萧条后的1931年写到。 “我发现当前商业亏损，产量减少及高失业率并非源自于一直延续到1929年春天的高投资水平，而是因为随后出现的投资中断 。 ” 几年后，凯恩斯提出了问题的解决方法。 在《就业、利息和货币的一般理论》一书中，凯恩斯解释了繁荣是如何建立的 ， “ 在充分就业情况下实际只能有，比如说，2%的投资收益率，但却被赋予了6%的预期收益率，并以此来进行估值 。 ” 在经济衰退期则相反，那些收益2%的投资却被视为“预期收益率小于零 。 ” 所产生的结果就是一个自我实现的预言，大规模的失业事实上导致那些投资的回报率低于零。 “我们随后出现了住宅短缺的情况 ， ” 凯恩斯写到 ， “ 但即便如此就算有这些住宅也没人能承担得起” 他的解决方案也很简单 ： “ 纠正贸易周期的正确方法并不是消灭繁荣而使我们长期处于半衰退状态；而是消灭衰退而令我们长期处于准繁荣状态 。 ” 对于凯恩斯来说，最基本的问题在于经济体的信贷渠道出现失��。 即便还有很多方法可以令人们积极开展工作，但对泡沫爆破以及随后银行倒闭潮的金融应对手段导致自然利率低于零。 如今，我们认识到信贷渠道受阻可以导致经济下行。 对此也有三个经常提出的应对方案。 一是扩张性的财政政策，在私人投资不振的情况下政府把相关责任承担起来。 二是提高通胀目标，给与中央银行更多的空间去应对金融冲击。 三是对负债和杠杆严加管控，尤其是住宅市场，防止形成由信贷推动的价格泡沫。 在这三个之外，凯恩斯会加上第四条，我们如今称之为“格林斯潘对策 ” — —利用货币政策去将泡沫最高峰时的资产价格合理化。 不幸的是，在政客们似乎无法抗拒使用财政紧缩手段，而2%的通胀目标也无法突破的情况下，我们的政策选项也相当有限。 而这最终也是为何一个小泡沫会造成大萧条的原因。"

            "Who Still Loves Trump? NEW YORK – Apart from 74 million voters in the United States, who still approves of President Donald Trump? Most Europeans are overjoyed to see the back of him. But he has been popular with a number of right-wing strongmen and demagogues, and many of their followers. His admiration for autocrats, his disdain for immigrants, racial minorities, and Muslims (except for a few Saudi princes), and his contempt for liberal democratic norms boosted authoritarian governments in Hungary, Poland, Brazil, India, and the Philippines. His esteem for Russian President Vladimir Putin was never in doubt. Trump’s election defeat is a setback for the global populist right. While many of its leaders will survive him, an already-rampant anti-liberal movement probably would have grown even stronger with a triumphant champion of its cause in the White House. Trump also found support among a majority of the population in two democratic countries, Israel and Taiwan, where he was seen as the most powerful enemy of their enemies, Iran and the People’s Republic of China, respectively. Israel’s right-wing prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, got everything he wanted from the Trump administration. The Palestinians got nothing. Israel’s most fanatical supporters in the US are also, by and large, Trump’s supporters; not American Jews, who mostly voted for Joe Biden, but evangelical Christians, who believe that God gave the Holy Land to the Chosen People, at least until the second coming of Christ, after which Jews will have to become Christians. But it is in East Asia where Trump’s popularity is most interesting, especially because many of his supporters are neither right wing nor anti-liberal – often quite the opposite. True, some people in China share Trump’s fear of Muslims, but that is not the main reason for pro-Trump sentiment. Earlier this year, I spoke to pro-democracy activists and politicians in Hong Kong and Taiwan, who saw Trump as a coarse but powerful leader of the free world against communist tyranny. The US flag was rarely absent from public demonstrations in Hong Kong and election rallies for the Democratic Progressive Party in Taiwan. Here, too, the influence of Christianity plays a part. One of the bravest democracy activists in Hong Kong is the entrepreneur and newspaper tycoon Jimmy Lai. Ever since the handover of the former British colony to China in 1997, Lai has been at the forefront of the struggle for greater civic freedom. He is also a fervent Catholic convert who believes that the battle between democracy and Chinese communist dictatorship is a clash of civilizations between the Christian free world and an atavistic, despotic China. Quite a few Christian Chinese dissidents share Lai’s view. They believe that liberal democracy is a product of Western civilization, which is true. Their view that democracy would not have been possible without the Christian faith (ancient Greece is conveniently forgotten) is more debatable. The notion that Asians can’t be true democrats if they aren’t Christians is demonstrably false. But there is more to the Chinese infatuation with Trump. As Ian Johnson recently wrote in the New York Times, some liberal dissidents in China are disturbed by the culture wars in the US. They view zealotry on the American left through the lens of their own far more violent history. When they see people hounded for ideological impurity, they see the ghosts of Mao’s Red Guards. To them, Trump’s boorish political incorrectness is a refreshing counterblast. Still, the main reason why people admire Trump in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, and also China, is fear of the Chinese regime. Despite his sporadic fawning over Chinese President Xi Jinping, Trump is seen as the man who stood up to China. This is his most important legacy in the eyes of those who believe the world is divided between two great powers, one still democratic, and the other nominally communist. Of course, in certain countries, China’s power has been feared for many centuries, irrespective of who happens to be in power, emperors or communists. Many Vietnamese praise Trump, but not because they are ruled by autocratic communists themselves. Although the US devastated much of Vietnam in the last century, China is the traditional enemy. South Korean and Japanese attitudes to the US are more ambivalent. Trump has his supporters in those countries, but, unlike in Taiwan, not among the majority of people. While Chinese power is often felt as a threat in both countries, dependence on the US for security has both been a necessity and an irritant. A swaggering bully in the White House raises the level of irritation. President-elect Joe Biden will almost certainly be a more popular bearer of the American burden in East Asia. Biden’s relations with China will also likely be less erratic and more diplomatic. But the basic tensions between a democratic superpower and an autocratic one will remain – and worsen if China sustains its economic success. In an age of rising disillusion with democratic government, China is a seductive model to many people. Just compare Chinese trains, airports, and other modern conveniences to America’s run-down infrastructure. Whether the trains run on time is of course not the only, or perhaps even the best, yardstick for good government. Mussolini’s trains famously (if apocryphally) ran on time as well. At least the US has shown the world that the rascal in power can still be voted out. But if America is to be held up as a model to counter the Chinese system, then its last president has done everything in his power to make it look like the less attractive one.",
            "谁还喜爱特朗普？ 纽约—除了美国的7400万选民，谁还认可美国总统管特朗普？ 大部分欧洲人因为他的去职而欢欣鼓舞。 但他在一些右翼强人和煽动家以及他们的追随者中间仍有很大的市场，他对独裁的仰慕，对移民、少数民族和穆斯林（除了沙特王子）的鄙夷，对自由民主范式的轻视，刺激了匈牙利、波兰、巴西、印度和菲律宾的极权主义政府。 而他尊崇俄罗斯总统普京更是毋庸置疑。 特朗普的败选是全球民粹主义右翼的一次挫折。 民粹主义右翼的许多领导人将继续掌权，但如果他们的头目仍能逍遥地呆在白宫，那么已经相当猖獗的反自由运动可能会更加旺盛。 特朗普在两个民主国家（原文如此）也赢得了大部分人口的支持：以色列和台湾，因为他被视为他们的敌人 — — 伊朗和中华人民共和国的最强大的敌人。 特朗普政府对以色列的右翼总理内塔尼亚胡有求必应。 巴勒斯坦人什么都得不到。 以色列在美国的最大“金主”基本上也都是特朗普的支持者 — — 不是美国犹太人（他们大多投票支持拜登 ） ， 而是福音派基督徒（他们相信上帝给了他的子民圣地，至少在基督再临前是如此，此后，犹太人将不得不成为基督徒。 ） 但特朗普在东亚广受欢迎才是最有趣的，特别是他的许多支持者既不是右翼，也不反自由 — — 而是恰好相反。 诚然，一些中国人也有特朗普式的穆斯林恐惧症，但这并不是支持特朗普的主要原因。 今年早些时候，我对香港和台湾的民主活动家和政客们发表了演讲。 他们认为特朗普是个粗人，但也是率领自由世界对抗共产主义暴政的强大领袖。 在香港公开示威和台湾民进党的选举集会上，美国的旗帜几乎从不缺席。 在这里，基督教也起到了一部分影响。 香港最勇猛的民主活动家之一是报业大亨黎智英。 自从1997年香港从英国殖民地回归中国以来，黎智英一直站在为更大的公民自由的斗争的最前沿。 他也是狂热的天主教徒，相信民主与中共独裁直接按的斗争也是基督教自由世界与返祖的专制中国之间的碰撞。 不少中国基督教徒异见分子与黎智英志趣相仿。 他们相信自由民主是西方民主的产物，确实如此。 他们认为民主不可能脱离基督教信仰存在（古希腊显然是被忘记了）则有待商榷。 不是基督徒的亚洲人就不是真正的民主派的概念也显然是错误的。 但中国痴迷于特朗普还有别的原因。 伊恩·约翰逊（Ian Johnson）最近在《纽约时报》写道，一些中国的自由派异见分子因为美国的文化战争而感到困扰。 他们透过自身更加暴力的历史来看待美国左翼的狂热。 当他们看到人们威逼思想不纯者时，想到的是毛泽东的红卫兵。 对他们来说，特朗普粗鄙的政治不正确是令人耳目一新的反击。 尽管如此，香港、台湾、日本、韩国还有中国人仰慕特朗普，主要原因还是害怕中国的体制。 尽管特朗普偶尔也说说中国国家主席习近平的好话，但他主要仍被视为抗华派。 在相信世界围绕两大超级大国一分为二，一边仍然民主，另一边名义上已是共产主义的人眼中，这是特朗普最重要的遗产。 当然，某些国家忌惮中国的实力已有几百年之久，不管是是皇帝还是共产党掌权。 许多越南人赞美特朗普，但不是因为他们也被专制共产党所统治。 尽管上个世纪美国曾让越南大部变成焦土，但中国才是传统敌人。 韩国和日本对美国的态度比较矛盾。 特朗普在这些国家都有支持者，但并非大部分人，这一点与台湾不同。 两国都感到了中国的实力的威胁，但依靠美国获得安全是必要的，也是麻烦。 白宫的霸凌增加了麻烦的因素。 当选总统拜登几乎肯定是更受欢迎的东亚责任承担者。 拜登的对华关系也可能不再那么飘忽不定，而更多依靠外交。 但民主超级大国与专制超级大国之间的基本对立将继续存在 — — 如果中国经济继续成功的话，还会加剧。 在对民主政府不断幻灭的时代，中国对很多人来说是一个非常诱人的榜样。 从中国的铁路、机场和其他现代便利与美国破败的基础设施之间的对比中便可一窥端倪。 当然，火车是否准点并不是唯一的 — — 甚至也不是最好的 — — 好政府标尺。 墨索里尼的火车也已准点著称（不过可能是假准点 ） 。 至少美国向世界证明，掌权的无赖仍然可以通过投票赶下台。 但如果美国想要巩固对抗中国制度的模式，那么它的上一任总统在用自己的权力尽可能地让中国制度现得更加诱人。"

            "America’s Leaky Justice CHICAGO – For the first time in American history, an insider at the US Supreme Court has deliberately disclosed a draft opinion in a high-profile case with the apparent intent of altering either the Court’s deliberations, or the public’s reactions to the putative decision. The contents of the draft – which would overrule the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision establishing a constitutional right to abortion – are momentous and dismaying. But how the newspaper Politico obtained the draft also matters. It bodes worse for the Court, as an institution, if the leaker was a justice, rather than a young law clerk, and it would be even more worrying if the leaker was a conservative rather than a liberal. Commentators have rushed to speculate about the source of Politico’s scoop. Since draft opinions originate in the Court, and are closely guarded, it is very unlikely that an outsider could have accidently stumbled upon one. Nor would a secretary or aide – long-term employees whose careers depend on their loyalty to the Court – likely have made an unauthorized disclosure. This means that the leak was most likely executed or enabled by a law clerk (top young law graduates who serve for one year only at the start of their career) or a justice. The difference between clerks and justices matters, because there are no plausible accountability mechanisms if the leaker was a justice. After all, no federal statute directly mandates secrecy for draft opinions, so criminal liability is only a remote possibility. The Code of Conduct for Judicial Employees does explicitly mention a federal criminal statute prohibiting theft of any “thing of value of the United States.” But whether this covers a draft opinion is at best unsettled. A criminal prosecution would face an uphill road. The more likely mechanism of individual accountability is noncriminal – but is available only for clerks, not justices. If the leaker was a clerk, they likely breached the federal courts’ code of conduct and could be fired. Past experience suggests they will be excoriated and suffer enduring professional consequences. Then again, if Twitter is any guide, plenty of liberals and conservatives nowadays appear ready to welcome and shelter one of their own. Remarkably, if a justice leaked the draft, there is no ethics infraction, because the Supreme Court exempts its members from the judiciary’s code of conduct. Nothing short of impeachment holds a justice in check. But in America’s hyperpolarized political environment, it is hard to imagine either Republicans or Democrats allowing one of their judicial allies to be thrown overboard. Just as the leak becomes more troubling if a justice rather than a clerk was its source, so it becomes more worrisome if the leaker was aligned with the Court’s conservative wing. This is certainly not because different standards apply according to ideology, but rather because the leaker’s ideological affinity changes the implications of the leak for the Court’s future. Imagine first that the leaker is aligned with the Court’s liberal wing. Their logic is hard to figure out. Most likely, the leaker thought that disclosing the draft would bring thousands of protesters to the streets, causing the majority to back down. But, aside from being unethical, this would be wishful thinking. As the political scientist Robert Dahl pointed out, the Court responds to the politics of elites, not the politics of the street. In the elite circles of Justice Samuel Alito (the author of the draft opinion) and his colleagues, being seen as standing up to “woke” protesters is more likely a badge of pride than a stain of dishonor. Now imagine the incentives of a conservative leaker. It is striking that the leaked draft is three months old. Why release an old, potentially superseded draft even if (as the Politico report suggested) it might still command a majority of the Court? One obvious answer is the leaker’s goal was to prevent one of the justices in the majority from defecting. Some news reports have suggested that Chief Justice John Roberts has drafted a narrower opinion – yet another leak! – upholding Mississippi’s anti-abortion law without overruling Roe. A conservative source might have thought that a leak could embarrass a wobbling member of Alito’s coalition into standing firm. To be seen to defect after having joined Alito’s draft would invite sharp scorn – a stain of dishonor – in the conservative circles in which most of those judges move. Of course, we don’t know the facts of the matter. But a hypothetical conservative leaker would at least be acting with a decent chance of success and little fear of consequences. In contrast, revelation of a liberal leaker would be an indication not of the way power works at the Court but merely of what people who are out of power and panicking can do. It would tell us only that there was a single individual who may have been foolish enough to believe the Court could be swayed by chanting on the streets. Revelation of a conservative leak would also demonstrate that at least some among the Court’s dominant faction are more wedded to the conservative movement’s ideological goals than they are to America’s political institutions. It would show that some of that faction is willing to jettison ethical norms, court criminal liability, and use shame to corral their wavering peers – even though they have a solid majority of the Court and little to fear by way of political reprisal. Most worryingly of all, if they succeed, the temptation to step outside the law to supplement their power will only grow. In the worst-case scenario, the investigation Roberts has ordered reveals that the leaker is a conservative justice. That would mark a truly destabilizing leap into the unknown, because it would suggest that one justice, unchecked by any accountability mechanism, believes it is acceptable to exploit the Court’s loose ethics regulation to keep their ideological movement united and on top. Now imagine such a justice weighing election-related disputes that come to the Court in 2022, 2024, and beyond. If members value their ideology more highly than the Court as an institution, then American democracy really is in serious jeopardy.",
            "美国正义的漏洞 芝加哥 — — 历史上第一次，美国最高法院内部人士在一个备受瞩目的案件中故意披露意见草案，明显意在改变法院的审议或公众对推定决定的反应。 草案的内容 — — 推翻具有里程碑意义、确立了宪法规定堕胎权的 1973 年罗伊诉韦德案（Roe v. Wade）裁决 — — 事关重大，令人沮丧。 但《政治报 》 （ Politico）如何搞到草案也很重要。 如果泄密者是一名法官，而不是年轻的法律助理，那么对作为制度的法院来说是一个更糟糕的预兆，如果泄密者是保守派而不是自由派，那就更令人担忧了。 评论家们竞相猜测《政治报》独家新闻的来源。 由于意见草案来自法院，并且受到严密保护，外人不太可能偶然发现。 秘书或助手 — — 作为长期雇员，他们的饭碗依赖于对法院忠诚 — — 也不会擅自披露。 这意味着泄密很可能是由法律文员（初出茅庐的顶尖法学院毕业生）或法官经手或促成的。 到底是文员还是法官之间很重要，因为，如果泄密者是法官，就没有合理的问责机制。 毕竟，没有任何联邦法规直接要求对意见草案保密，因此几无可能追究刑事责任。 《司法行为规范》确实明文提到了一项禁止盗窃一切 “美国的有价值的东西”的联邦刑律。 但这是否涵盖意见草案尚无定论。 刑事起诉很难成立。 更有可能的是非刑事的个人问责机制 — — 但仅适用于文员，不适用于法官。 如果泄密者是职员，他们很可能违反了联邦法院行为准则，可能会被解雇。 过去的经验表明，他们将受到谴责并承担持久的职业后果。 话又说回来，如果以推特为指南，那么现在有大量自由派和保守派已经准备好欢迎和庇护自己人。 值得注意的是，如果法官泄露了草案，则不存在违反道德规范的行为，因为最高法院豁免其成员遵守司法行为规范。 除了弹劾之外，没有什么可以制衡法官。 但在美国两极化的政治环境中，很难想象共和党或民主党会允许他们的司法盟友之一被抛弃。 正如如果法官而不是文员泄密更加麻烦，如果泄密者属于法院的保守派阵营，就更加令人担忧。 这当然不是因为根据意识形态适用不同的标准，而是因为泄密者的意识形态倾向决定着泄密对法院未来的影响。 首先想象泄密者属于最高法院的自由派阵营。 他们的逻辑很难弄清楚。 最有可能的是，泄密者认为披露草案会使成千上万的抗议者走上街头，让多数派让步。 但是，这不仅不道德，也是一厢情愿。 政治学家罗伯特·达尔（Robert Dahl）指出，法院回应精英政治，而不是街头政治。 在塞缪尔·阿利托大法官（Samuel Alito，意见草案的作者）和他的同事的精英圈子里，被视为挺身而出“唤醒”抗议者更像是一种骄傲而不是耻辱的象征。 现在想象一下保守派泄密者的动机。 令人惊讶的是，泄露的草稿已经写完三个月了。 为什么要泄露一份旧的、可能被取代的草案，哪怕（如《政治报》报道所言）它可能仍然占据法院的多数席位？ 一个明显的答案是泄密者的目标是阻止多数法官中的一人叛变。 一些新闻报道表明，首席大法官约翰·罗伯茨（John Roberts）起草了一个狭隘的意见 — — 又一次泄密！ — — 维护密西西比州反堕胎法而不推翻罗伊案。 某保守派消息人士可能认为，泄密会让阿利托联盟中摇摆不定的成员尴尬，从而坐实​​。 在加入阿利托草案后被视为叛逃会招致大部分法官加入其中的保守派的强烈鄙视 — — 一个耻辱的污点。 当然，我们不知道事情的真相。 但是一个假想的保守派泄密者至少成功机会很大，并且几乎不必担心后果。 相比之下，如果是自由派泄密者揭露此事，则并不说明最高法院的权力运行，而是表明失去权力和恐慌的人可以做什么。 它只能告诉我们，有一个人可能已经愚蠢到相信可以裹挟舆论影响最高法院。 保守派泄密也将表明，在法院的主导派系中，至少有一些人只是更倾向保守运动的意识形态目标，而不是美国的政治制度。 这表明，该派系中的一些人愿意抛弃道德规范，承担刑事责任，并用羞耻感来围捕摇摆不定的同侪 — — 哪怕他们已经拥有最高法院绝对多数席位，而且几乎不惧怕政治报复。 最令人担忧的是，如果他们成功，用逍遥法外来补充他们权力的诱惑只会越来越大。 在最坏的情况下，罗伯茨下令进行的调查显示，泄密者是一位保守派法官。 这真正标志着迈向未知的动摇性一跃，因为这表明，一位不受任何问责机制制约的大法官认为，利用法院松散的道德规范来保持其意识形态运动的统一和领先是可以接受的。 现在想象一下，这样一位法官会权衡 2022 年、2024 年及以后提交给法院的与选举相关的争议。 如果最高法院成员们更重视他们的意识形态而不是作为制度的法院，那么美国的民主就真的处于严重危险之中了。"

            "Rebalancing the State’s Balance Sheet MILAN – Until recently, relatively little attention was paid to states’ balance sheets. Measurement and reporting were neglected. Even today, states’ liabilities receive considerable attention, while their asset sides receive significantly less. In an earlier era, states owned substantial industrial assets. This “commanding heights of the economy” model was rejected largely because it seriously under-performed, especially when state-owned sectors were protected from competition (as was the norm). Efficiency declined. But, more important, the absence of entry and exit by firms, a key ingredient of innovation, caused dynamism to suffer and losses to grow over time. The model’s shortcomings led to privatization in many developed and developing countries. In Europe, privatization was viewed as a key step in the integration process. The theory, in Europe and elsewhere, was that states could not be impartial owners of industrial assets. Through regulation, public procurement, and hidden subsidies, they would favor their own assets. Of course, state ownership is not the only way to impede efficiency and dynamism. Regulations in a range of countries, from Japan to Italy, create sectors that are sheltered from competition, with detrimental effects on productivity. This pattern is particularly pronounced in the non-tradable sectors (which account for two-thirds of the economy), where the discipline of foreign competition is absent by definition. Even here, foreign-based domestic competitors could improve performance. It is important that more attention is now paid to public liabilities – not only growing sovereign debt, but also larger, non-debt liabilities embedded in social-insurance programs. A combination of defective growth models, rising longevity, and unanticipated increases in costs (such as health care in America) have caused these longer-term liabilities to explode. Reining in debt and other liabilities has substantially reduced governments’ scope for sustaining demand in the face of severe negative shocks, thus reducing their ability to buy time for structural adjustment in the private sector. For now, investment in a shift to a sustainable growth and employment pattern has been crowded out. Shifting consumption to investment via tax increases is possible, but too problematic politically, with the burden-sharing issue usually leading to impasse and inaction. Meanwhile, the asset side of states’ balance sheets remains largely invisible. States own land, mineral rights, and infrastructure. Some have sovereign wealth funds. Many have public pension funds of substantial magnitude, consisting of diversified portfolios of assets. These assets are, in a sense, spoken for – there are claims on them in the form of liabilities, which have grown as expected risk-adjusted returns on assets decline; but they do represent a partial funding of public liabilities and are an element of resilience. By contrast, in China, the asset side of the state balance sheet is very large: land, foreign-currency reserves of $3.5 trillion, and around an 85% stake in state-owned enterprises that account for about 40% of output. This balance-sheet configuration has helped China to respond to shocks and sustain high levels of public-sector investment. The liability side will expand as social insurance grows – but slowly, owing to a fear of underestimating the liabilities being created. In the best case – without a sharp decline in financial assets accelerating an economic downturn, a sudden collapse of a defective growth model, or even rapid increases in liabilities associated with demographic shifts or health-care technology – it might make sense to focus only on controlling liabilities. But a best-case scenario provides a poor policy framework in our imperfect world. In fact, states are routinely called upon to deal with a wide range of market failures or limitations: unsustainable growth patterns and regulatory myopia; distributional problems associated with the evolution of technology and globalization; accelerating concentration of national income; and major structural transitions associated with shocks and secular trends in technology and the global economy. Here is the dilemma: Governments with substantial assets have flexibility and the capacity to act, but they can also mismanage their assets to the detriment of markets and economic dynamism. In China, where the asset side of the balance sheet is large, the strategy of shrinking it via privatization has been largely rejected, at least for now. The loss of resilience would be too great. That leads to the challenge of effective management of public assets – management that promotes rather than impedes market efficiency and innovation. Here, what might be called the pension/sovereign-wealth-fund model – in which a public entity holds and manages a diversified portfolio of assets as a financial investor with appropriately specified duties and governance – seems to be the right way to go. The asset side of the balance sheet is maintained in the aggregate, but the management of the assets, particularly the diversification of holdings, can be thought of as prudent and de facto privatized. For developed countries, increasing resilience and flexibility over time by building public assets should be a long-term priority. Periodic systemic risk affects entire economies and public finances, not only financial markets, and governments should be able to respond during periods of rapid structural change. In practice, this means two things. First, once a collective choice is made about the desired levels of social insurance, the implied liabilities should be fully funded over time. The alternative is a poor intergenerational burden-sharing choice. Second, governments, like individuals, households, and businesses, need to save for a rainy day. That is all the more important in periods – like the current one – of rapid change, high volatility, and only partly predictable systemic instability.",
            "重新平衡国家资产负债表 发自米兰 — — 直到最近，人们对世界各国资产负债表的关注一直都较少。 对这些数据的测算和报告都被忽略了。 而即使是在各国负债状况受到外界普遍关注的今天，其资产状况依旧鲜有人问津。 从前各国都拥有大量的工业资产。 但这种“占据经济制高点”的模式由于其严重表现不佳而遭到了摈弃，尤其当国有企业在竞争中受到保护时（这已经成为常态 ） 。 效率因此降低。 但更重要的是，缺少企业的进入或退出 — — 这才是创新的关键组成部分 — — 导致经济活力不足，其损失也随着时间的推移而不断增大。 这种模式的缺点导致很多发达及发展中国家进行私有化。 在欧洲，私有化被看作是一体化进程的关键步骤。 欧洲和其他地区的理念是国家不可能成为工业资产的无私持有者。 借助相关法律法规、政府采购以及隐性津贴，政府会偏帮它们自己名下的资产。 当然，国有制并不是惟一阻碍效率与活力的因素。 一些国家（从日本到意大利）的相关规定造就了一批无需参与竞争的部门，这对生产力来说是一种损害。 这种模式在占整体经济规模2/3的非贸易部门显得尤其明显，国外竞争法则在这些领域是受到明令禁止的。 即使在笔者所在的意大利米兰，拥有国外背景的国内竞争者都有改善其表现的空间。 更多地关注公共负债很重要 — — 公共负债不仅包括不断积累的主权债务，也包括那些在社会保险项目上数目更为庞大的非债务负债。 有缺陷的增长模式、不断延长的寿命与超出预计的成本增加（比如美国的医疗）一起导致了长期债务的爆发式增长。 债务和其它应付款项的制肘之下，政府面对严重的负面冲击时维持需求的余地也大大缩小，并因此降低了它们为私人部门进行结构性调整争取时间的能力。 就目前而言，投资转向可持续发展和就业的模式已经被排挤出局。 通过增税使消费转向投资是有可能的，但在政治上很成问题，因为责任由谁分担的问题往往最终会导致僵局与不作为。 与此同时，国家资产负债平衡表的资产一面在很大程度上仍是隐性的，比如国有土地、矿权和基础设施。 有些国家有主权财富基金。 很多国家都有规模庞大的公共养老基金，并由多元化投资组合构成。 这些资产，某种意义上说，都已经名花有主了 — — 它们会以应付款项的形式支付给应得的人，而随着在预期中资产风险调整收益的下跌这些支付责任还有所增加；但它们的确代表了一部分公共负债的资金来源并且也是实现经济复苏的一项要素。 相比之下，中国国家资产负债表的资产方面非常巨大：土地、外汇储蓄高达3.5万亿美元并且拥有国企85%的股份 — — 这相当于全国总产出的40 % 。 这种资产负债结构已经帮助中国顺利应对金融冲击并维持巨额公共投资。 而这些资产的负债一面将会随着社会保险覆盖的增长而扩张 — — 但由于害怕低估即将产生的负债，这种扩张的步伐将会相对缓慢。 最好的情况是 — — 金融资产不会急剧下挫而导致经济衰退加速，有缺陷的增长模型不会突然崩溃，或是与人口结构转换或医疗技术相关的负债不会急剧上升 — — 这样仅仅集中精力控制负债就说得通。 然而这种美梦式的设想会给我们这个从不完美的世界带来差劲的政策。 事实上，国家也通常被要求处理各种市场失灵或市场局限性：不可持续的增长模式和监管上的短视；与技术进步及全球化相关的分配问题；国民收入（向少数成员）的加速集中；与科技和全球经济的冲击和长期趋势相关的重要结构性转型。 而困境就在于：拥有大量资产的政府拥有灵活性和行动力，但它们同时也会因资产处置失当对市场和经济活力造成破坏。 中国资产负债表上的资产一面非常巨大，通过私有化来对其进行收缩的策略已经被摈弃了，至少目前来说是如此。 而失去经济复原能力的代价可能会极为巨大。 这就提出了对公共资产进行有效管理的挑战 — — 这种管理应该促进而不是妨碍市场效率和创新。 在此那种可能会被称为养老金或主权财富基金的模式 — — 拥有和管理一个多样化资产组合的某个公共实体成为了一个具备特定责任和管制能力的金融投资者 ， — —似乎是一条明智的路。 资产负债表的资产一面总体维持不变，而对资产的管理 — — 尤其是所持资产的多样化 — — 可以被认为是谨慎以及事实上的私有化。 对发达国家来说，通过构建公共资产来提升复原能力和灵活性应该是长期的优先选择。 这回死因为周期性涌现的系统风险影响着整个经济和公共金融 — — 不仅是金融市场，而政府应当有能力在快速结构性变革的时期做出应对。 实际上，这意味着两件事。 首先，一但作出了与社会保险所需水平相关的集体选择，其暗含的支付责任就应当得到充分的资金支持。 与此相对的拙劣选择则是由几代人来分担责任。 其二，跟个人、家庭和公司一样，政府也需要未雨绸缪。 这在那些急速变化、波动大并且系统不稳定只能被部分预测的时期 — — 正如眼前这段时间，这才是最重要的。"

            "Why Support the TPP? CAMBRIDGE – Agreement among negotiators from 12 Pacific Rim countries on the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) represents a triumph over long odds. Tremendous political obstacles, both domestic and international, had to be overcome to conclude the deal. And now critics of the TPP’s ratification, particularly in the United States, should read the agreement with an open mind. Many of the issues surrounding the TPP have been framed, at least in US political terms, as left versus right. The left’s unremitting hostility to the deal – often on the grounds that the US Congress was kept in the dark about its content during negotiations – carried two dangers. A worthwhile effort could have been blocked, or President Barack Obama’s Democratic administration could have been compelled to be more generous to American corporations, in order to pick up needed votes from Republicans. In fact, those concerned about labor rights and the environment risked hurting their own cause. By seeming to say that they would not support the TPP under any conditions, Obama had little incentive to pursue their demands. Seen in this light, the TPP that has emerged is a pleasant surprise. The agreement gives pharmaceutical firms, tobacco companies, and other corporations substantially less than they had asked for – so much so that US Senator Orrin Hatch and some other Republicans now threaten to oppose ratification. Likewise, the deal gives environmentalists more than they had bothered to ask for. Perhaps some of these outcomes were the result of hard bargaining by other trading partners (such as Australia). Regardless, the TPP’s critics should now read the specifics that they have so long said they wanted to see and reconsider their opposition to the deal. The most controversial issues in the US are those that are sometimes classified as “deep integration,” because they go beyond the traditional easing of trade tariffs and quotas. The left’s concerns about labor and the environment were accompanied by fears about excessive benefits for corporations: protection of the intellectual property of pharmaceutical and other companies, and the mechanisms used to settle disputes between investors and states. So what, exactly, is in the finished TPP? Among the environmental features, two stand out. The agreement includes substantial steps to enforce the prohibitions contained in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). It also takes substantial steps to limit subsidies for fishing fleets – which in many countries waste taxpayer money and accelerate the depletion of marine life. For the first time, apparently, these environmental measures will be backed up by trade sanctions. I wish that certain environmental groups had devoted half as much time and energy ascertaining the potential for such good outcomes as they did to sweeping condemnations of the negotiating process. The critics apparently were too busy to notice when the agreement on fishing subsidies was reached in Maui in July. But it is not too late for environmentalists to get on board. Similarly, various provisions in the area of labor practices, particularly in Southeast Asia, are progressive. These include measures to promote union rights in Vietnam and steps to crack down on human trafficking in Malaysia. Perhaps the greatest uncertainty concerned the extent to which big US corporations would get what they wanted in the areas of investor-government dispute settlement and intellectual property protection. The TPP’s critics often neglected to acknowledge that international dispute-settlement mechanisms could ever serve a valid purpose, or that some degree of patent protection is needed if pharmaceutical companies are to have sufficient incentive to invest in research and development. There was, of course, a danger that such protections for corporations could go too far. The dispute-settlement provisions might have interfered unreasonably with member countries’ anti-smoking campaigns, for example. But, in the end, the tobacco companies did not get what they had been demanding; Australia is now free to ban brand-name logos on cigarette packs. The TPP also sets other new safeguards against the misuse of the dispute-settlement mechanism. Likewise, the intellectual property protections might have established a 12-year monopoly on the data that US pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies compile on new drugs (particularly biologics), thereby impeding competition from lower-cost generic versions. In the end, these companies did not get all they wanted; while the TPP in some ways gives their intellectual property more protection than they had before, it assures protection of their data for only 5-8 years. The focus on new areas of deep integration should not obscure the old-fashioned free-trade benefits that are also part of the TPP: reducing thousands of existing tariff and non-tariff barriers. Liberalization will affect manufacturing sectors such as the automotive industry, as well as services, including the Internet. Liberalization of agriculture – long a stubborn holdout in international trade negotiations – is noteworthy. Countries like Japan have agreed to let in more dairy products, sugar, beef, and rice from more efficient producers in countries like New Zealand and Australia. In all these areas and more, traditional textbook arguments about the gains from trade apply: new export opportunities lead to higher wages and a lower cost of living. Many citizens and politicians made up their minds about TPP long ago, based on seemingly devastating critiques of what might emerge from the negotiations. They should now look at the outcome with an open mind. They just might find that their worst nighttime fears have vanished by the light of day.",
            "为何支持TPP？ 美国剑桥—来自12个环太平洋国家的谈判员终于在跨太平洋洋合作伙伴关系（TPP）上达成一致，这是一次非常难能可贵的胜利。 达成协议需要克服巨大的国内和国际政治障碍。 而如今，对批准TPP持批评态度者，特别是在美国，应该以开放的态度读一读这个协议。 围绕TPP的诸多问题被定性为左右之争，至少在美国政治界是如此。 左派对该协议抱有坚定不移的敌意 — — 其理由常常是美国国会在谈判期间一直对内容一无所知 — — 这带曾经来了两大危险。 一项值得为此付出的努力可能被阻挠，或总统奥巴马的民主党政府可能被迫对美国公司采取更慷慨的态度，这样才能从共和党手中争夺必需的选票。 事实上，那些关心劳工权利和环境的人可能搬起石头砸自己的脚。 既然他们表现出在任何条件下都不会支持TPP，那么奥巴马也就没什么动力追求他们的所求。 从这个角度看，TPP可谓是意外之喜。 该协议给制药企业、烟草公司和其他公司所带来的东西远远少于它们所要求的，以致于美国参议员奥林·哈奇（Orrin Hatch）和其他一些共和党威胁要反对批准TPP。 类似地，该协议给环保主义者带来的东西要多于他们所要求的。 也许这些结果中有一些是拜其他贸易伙伴（如澳大利亚）的强硬讨价还价所赐。 无论如何，TPP的批评者现在应该读一读那些长期以来他们一直说想一睹为快的具体条款，并重新思考对该协议的反对态度。 在美国，最具争议性的问题那些有时被归类为“深度一体化”的问题，因为它们超过了传统的放松贸易关税和配额的范畴。 左派对劳工和环境的关注伴随着对公司过度获益的担忧：对制药公司和其他公司知识产权的保护以及用于解决投资者和国家纠纷的机制。 那么，已完成的TPP究竟包含了些什么？ 在环境方面，有两点特别引人注目。 TPP包括了执行写入国际濒危物种国际贸易公约（CITES）的禁令的重大措施。 它还规定了重大措施限制对捕鱼船队的补贴 — — 在许多国家，这一补贴浪费了纳税人的钱，也加速了海洋生物的耗竭。 显然，这些环境措施是第一次得到贸易制裁的支持。 我希望某些环保组织可以拿出它们用于大肆谴责谈判过程一半的时间和精力用于研究这些好结果的潜力。 批评者显然太忙了，以致于他们没有注意到关于渔业补贴的协议7月在毛伊岛就已经达成。 但环保主义者现在开始努力也不晚。 类似地，劳工实践领域的诸多条款，特别是在东南亚，也具有进步性。 这些条款包括促进越南工会权利的措施和打击马来西亚人口贩卖的措施。 也许最大的不确定性在于美国大公司能在多大程度上在投资者-政府纠纷解决和知识产权保护等领域得偿所愿。 TPP批评者常常不承认国际纠纷解决机制能够有助于合理目的，或者，要让制药公司有足够的激励投资于研发就必须进行一定程度的专利保护。 当然，一个危险是对公司的保护走得太远。 比如，纠纷解决条款也许会不合理地干扰成员国的禁烟运动。 但是，最终，烟草公司并没有得偿所愿；如今，澳大利亚大可以禁止在香烟包装盒上出现商标名标志。 TPP还规定了防止纠纷解决机制滥用的新条款。 类似地，知识产权保护已经为美国制药和生物科技公司建立了12年的新药（特别是生物制药）数据垄断，从而阻止来自成本更低的仿制药的竞争。 最后，这些公司没有得到想要的一切；尽管TPP以某种方式给了它们比以前更多的知识产权保护，但对于它们的新药数据，保护期只有5—8年。 关注深度一体化的新领域不应该忽视老牌 自由贸易益处，它们也是TPP的一部分：降低了数千种现有关税和非关税壁垒。 自由化将影响到汽车业等制造业，也将影响��包括互联网在内的服务业。 农业自由化 — — 长期以来一直在顽固地拒绝在国际贸易谈判门外 — — 也值得关注。 日本等国家同意来自新西兰和澳大利亚等国家的效率更高的生产商的奶制品、糖、牛肉和大米进入国内。 在所有这些和其他领域，关于贸易的益处的传统教科书观点都适用：新的进口机会带来更高的工资和更低的生活成本。 许多公民和政客对TPP的看法在很久以前便已形成，并且是基于对谈判可能结果的毁灭性批评。 现在，他们应该带着开放心态看一看谈判结果。 他们会发现，他们最糟糕的噩梦情景已经消失在朗朗乾坤之下。"

            "Why Taiwan Matters CAMBRIDGE/CHICAGO – US Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi’s headline-generating visit to Taipei has reminded the world how much Taiwan matters to China. But Taiwan also should matter to the democratic world. It is no secret that the Communist Party of China (CPC) is committed to unifying Taiwan (which it views as a breakaway province) with the mainland. The United States formally recognized the People’s Republic of China as the sole legal government of China in 1979, and Western powers have since mostly refrained from recognizing Taiwan as a separate country. This “One China” policy, together with rising nationalist sentiment in China, makes a Chinese takeover of the island in the coming decades seem likely, if not inevitable. Some Western commentators believe that Pelosi acted recklessly by visiting the island. But they ignore how and why Taiwan also matters for the future of both democracy and China itself. A common belief among Western policymakers and many commentators nowadays is that China will remain non-democratic for the foreseeable future, owing to its deeply authoritarian political culture. According to this view, the West’s “individualism” stands in stark contrast to China’s Confucian heritage, which entails rigid hierarchies not just in families but in all social settings. The implication is that the Chinese people are more willing to take their place within a pre-defined order of authority, and less willing to participate in democratic politics. Hence, political scientist Samuel P. Huntington once asserted that “no scholarly disagreement exists regarding the proposition that traditional Confucianism was either undemocratic or antidemocratic.” And more recently, Ray Dalio of Bridgewater Associates writes: “All of these Chinese systems are hierarchical and non-egalitarian. … America is run from the bottom up (e.g., democracy) and optimized for the individual; China is run from the top down and optimized for the collective. … Democracy as we know it doesn’t have any roots in China.” It is easy to see how the last 2,500 years of Chinese history might support these ideas. China has experienced many rebellions and the rise and fall of many powerful dynasties. Since democratic politics has been conspicuously absent through it all, many assume that China is bound to remain under the command of a strong leader presiding over a top-down regime, and Chinese state propaganda assiduously fosters this view. Chinese newspapers and political commentators constantly contrast the Chinese system’s efficiency to the West’s gridlocked politics, while also pointing out that it is more in line with Chinese values and culture. But is it? Hong Kong and Taiwan are cut from the same cultural cloth as mainland China, yet they rest on very different political systems. Until the CPC’s crackdown on Hong Kong in 2020, the island was in the process of building a vibrant democracy. And Taiwan is even more revealing. Since the 1980s, it has developed a robust democracy with broad-based participation. Far from being established and developed by elites, Taiwan’s system is the result of students and other ordinary citizens demanding more through democratic politics. Democratic participation in Taiwan appears to have intensified over the last six years. The island’s dominant party for most of its history was the Kuomintang, founded by Chiang Kai-shek, the Chinese nationalist who fled the mainland with his loyal troops and about 1.5 million supporters after being defeated in 1949 by the Communists. The current government, led by the Democratic Progressive Party, came to power in the 2016 general election, following widespread protests against the KMT’s efforts to ram through a trade deal with China despite significant opposition. During the protests, the student-led Sunflower Movement even occupied Parliament. This was not just a passing phase of anger and protest. The Taiwanese are pioneers in digital democracy. Active political participation by different segments of society is the norm. That is why Taiwanese governments routinely consult the public on key decisions, such as ridesharing regulations and liquor sales. Taiwan also hosts a “presidential hackathon” that allows citizens to make direct proposals to the president, and a digital platform provides data from most Taiwanese ministries, with the explicit purpose of encouraging civil society to improve government operations. And in the face of COVID-19, its government marshaled an effective response through democratic consultation, close collaboration with civil society, and new digital tools for testing and contact tracing. Taiwan exhibits these strong democratic tendencies, not because it has undergone a Westernizing cultural transformation. Until 2000, the KMT regime leveraged Confucian values to set itself apart from the Communist regime in China, and subsequent surveys have shown that Confucian values are even more deeply held in Taiwan than on the mainland. The island thus reinforces a point that we have made in previous work: It is misguided to assert any kind of unbreakable link between cultural values and political systems. All cultures, and particularly Confucian ones, should be viewed as highly adaptable to changing circumstances. Political regimes can rest on many cultural frames. While Confucius did say that “commoners do not debate matters of government,” he also emphasized that “a state cannot stand if it has lost the confidence of the people.” Confucian thought recommends respect and obedience to leaders only if they are virtuous. It thus follows that if a leader is not virtuous, he or she can – and perhaps should – be replaced. This perfectly valid interpretation of Confucian values underpins Taiwanese democracy. By contrast, CPC propaganda holds that Confucian values are utterly incompatible with democracy, and that there is no viable alternative to one-party rule. This is patently false. Democracy is as feasible in China as it is in Taiwan. No matter how strident the CPC’s bluster becomes, it will not extinguish people’s desire to participate in politics, complain about injustices, or replace leaders who misbehave. Taiwan matters because it represents an alternative political path for China – one that has long sustained freedom and prosperity in the West.",
            "为什么台湾很重要 坎布里奇/芝加哥—美国众议院议长南希·佩洛西占据媒体头条的对台北的访问已经向世界展示了台湾对中国而言何等重要。 但台湾对民主世界应当也很重要。 中国共产党（CPC）一直致力于实现台湾（被视为一个分离省份）与大陆的统一。 美国于1979年正式承认中华人民共和国为中国唯一合法政府，此后，西方列强大多不承认台湾为独立国家。 上述“一个中国”的政策，加之中国民族主义情绪日益高涨，导致中国似乎很有可能在未来数十年内接管台湾，而这种接管甚至是不可避免的。 有些西方评论人士认为，佩洛西对该岛的访问是鲁莽的。 但台湾为什么对民主和中国自身的未来同样重要却被他们所忽视了。 西方决策者和许多评论人士目前的一个共同信念是，中国在可以预见的未来仍将是非民主国家，这是该国高度专制的政治文化所决定的。 这种观点显示，西方的“个人主义”与中国的儒家传统形成鲜明的对比，而儒家传统不仅在家庭、也在所有社会环境中都带来了严格的等级制度。 这意味着中国民众更愿意在预先确定好的权威秩序中占据一席之地，而且不太愿意参与民主政治生活。 因此，政治学家塞缪尔·P·亨廷顿曾经断言 ， “ 对于传统儒家思想要么不民主、要么反民主的命题，学术界是不存在分歧的 。 ” 最近，桥水基金的雷·达里奥曾写道 ： “ 所有这些中国体制都是等级森严且非平等主义的。 …美国实行自下而上的管理（如民主）并为个人进行了优化；而中国则实行自上而下的管理，并为集体而进行了优化。 …我们所熟知的民主在中国是没有任何根基的 。 ” 不难看出，过去2，500年来的中国历史是如何支持上述观点的。 中国已经经历过诸多叛乱和强大王朝的起起落落。 由于民主政治在其中显著缺席，许多人认为中国注定会继续处于一个自上而下政权强势领袖的指挥之下，而且，这种观点也得到了中国国家宣传的刻意强化。 中国的报纸和政治评论员不断将中国体制的高效与西方陷入僵局的政治进行对比 ，同时还指出，中国的现行体制更符合中国的价值观和文化。 但事实真是这样吗？ 香港和台湾与中国大陆拥有同样的文化背景，但它们的政治制度却是截然不同的。 直到2020年中国共产党镇压香港之前，该岛正在建设的民主制度是充满活力的。 而台湾则更能说明问题。 自1980年代以来，它建立了一种基础广泛的强大民主制度。 建立和发扬台湾制度的远非少数精英，相反是由学生和其他普通民众通过民主政治所促成的结果。 过去6年来，台湾的民主参与似乎有所强化。 该岛历史上多数时间执政的主要政党是由蒋介石所创立的国民党，蒋是一位中国民族主义者，他于1949年被共产党击败后，带着忠于自己的军队和约150万支持者逃离了大陆。 由民进党所领导的现任政府于2016年大选中上台，此前曾爆发针对国民党的大规模抗议，抗议国民党不顾大规模反对，强行与中国达成贸易协议。 在抗议期间，以学生为主要力量的向日葵运动甚至占领了议会。 这绝不仅仅是暂时的愤怒和抗议。 台湾民众是数字民主制度的先驱。 社会各阶层对政治的积极参与已成为常态。 这也解释了为什么台湾政府经常会征询公众意见，以作出有关拼车法规和酒类销售等关键问题的决策。 台湾还举办允许民众向总统直接谏言的“总统黑客马拉松 ， ” 该数字平台提供来自多数台湾部门的数据，其明确目的是鼓励公民社会参与改善政府运作。 面对2019年新冠疫情，其政府通过民主协商、与民间社会开展密切合作以及用于检测和接触者追踪的全新数据工具而制定了有效的应对之策。 台湾表现出强烈的民主倾向，而这并非仅仅因为它经历了西方化的文化转型。 直到2000年，国民党政权利用儒家价值观来区分其自身和中国的共产党政府。 而随后进行的调查 显示，儒家价值观在台湾比在大陆更深入人心。 因此，该岛强化了一个我们在此前著作中曾经提到过的观点：断言文化价值和政治制度之间存在某种牢不可破的联系是一种错误。 所有文化，尤其是儒家文化，均应被视为高度适应不断变化环境的产物。 诸多文化框架均可以建立相应的政治制度。 虽然孔子的确说过“平民不议政 ， ” 但他也强调过 ， “ 失去民众信任的国家就丧失了基础 。 ” 儒家思想建议只尊重和服从有德的领袖。 因此，顺理成章的结论是，如果领导人无德，那么他或她可以 — — 而且也许应当 — — 被代替。 台湾民主制度的基础就是这种对儒家价值观的完美诠释。 相比之下，中共宣传攻势则认为儒家价值观与民主水火不容，而且，除一党专政外，别无其他可行选择。 而这明显错误。 民主在中国和台湾都是一样可行的。 中共呼声再强，民众参政、抱怨不公以及更换行为不端领袖的欲望也不会被浇灭。 台湾之所以重要，是因为它代表了中国另外一条可行的政治道路 — — 这条道路保持了西方长期的自由和繁荣。"

            "Why This Time Was Different STOCKHOLM – How will the COVID-19 mega-crisis end? I don’t know, and nor does anyone else. So, perhaps it would be more productive to reflect on how it started. By addressing that issue, we might be able to improve our chances of averting another pandemic in the future. The current crisis is hardly the first of its kind. In early 2003, another coronavirus – SARS-CoV-1 – suddenly spread from southern China across Southeast Asia, but it ultimately remained regionally contained. Later, we learned that SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) had been spreading in southern China for some time, and that Chinese officials had been reluctant even to admit its existence and issue a warning, let alone take appropriate measures to contain it. Only after the epidemic had reached Hong Kong, a key global financial hub, did alarm bells go off. Nonetheless, coordinated international action soon followed. There was a sharp drop in air traffic in the region, and many areas were cordoned off. The World Health Organization’s leaders at the time criticized China for its slow response, and the Chinese health minister was duly fired. By early July, the WHO was able to declare the crisis over, lifting its remaining recommendations for restrictive measures. The world returned to normal. Why have we failed so spectacularly in 2020 after succeeding in 2003? Any answer to that question will be tentative, because there is much that we still don’t know about COVID-19 or the early months of the outbreak. Still, I see four factors that might help to explain the difference between now and then. First, it took time for Chinese authorities to wake up to what was happening, sound the alarm, and start taking resolute action. From what we know, COVID-19 first emerged in China in mid-November 2019, and had been detected spreading through Wuhan by mid-December, when reports started circulating in Taiwan. Finally, on December 31, 2019, China alerted the WHO of a potential outbreak. During those early weeks, local authorities in Wuhan sought to cover up the outbreak, including by concealing information from the central government in Beijing. We may never know just how much time was lost to Wuhan officials’ obfuscation. But we do know that after China’s first report to the WHO, it took another three weeks for Chinese authorities to lock down Hubei province. By that point, many residents had left for the Chinese New Year holiday, spreading the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, to other parts of the country (meanwhile, Wuhan allowed street celebrations to proceed). A second factor that makes this crisis different from the one in 2003 is that SARS-CoV-2 seems to be much more contagious than its predecessor. This has magnified the consequences of Chinese foot-dragging. During those initial 5-7 weeks, and in the weeks after the WHO sounded the alarm, when the rest of the world did very little, COVID-19 was able to spread much farther and wider than SARS ever did, and the result has been far deadlier. The third, related, factor is that the world of 2019-2020 is much more interconnected than the world of 2002-2003 was. Wuhan, an inland city with 11 million people, has sometimes been called the Chicago of China, owing to its wide-ranging integration into global supply chains. Over the past few decades, the city has developed into a major hub. Before the lockdown pandemic, there were six flights per week from Wuhan to Paris (as well as five to Rome and three to London), and frequent non-stop flights to San Francisco and New York. What happened in Wuhan did not stay in Wuhan. The last factor that cannot be ignored is the geopolitical dimension. The world was already falling into a persistent state of confrontation and disarray long before the COVID-19 crisis erupted. Back in 2003, it was only natural that the international community would come together quickly to coordinate a joint response. But in 2020, that scenario wasn’t even on the table. Even after the virus had gone global, US President Donald Trump’s administration remained in denial. And to this day, it has not made even the slightest gesture toward providing global leadership. America’s historic abdication of its traditional role has trickled down, infecting most of the established instruments of global cooperation. When the WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11, it might already have been too late. But the confused and flailing reaction from the United States and other major countries has clearly made matters far worse. My tentative conclusion is that these four factors together explain why this episode is so much more severe than the SARS epidemic. A novel coronavirus has plunged the world into a mega-crisis the likes of which we have not seen in modern times. We should consider what that says about the state of global governance. Again, nobody knows how this crisis will end. But by understanding how it started, we might be able to prevent, or at least mitigate, the next one.",
            "为什么这次不一样了 发自斯德哥尔摩—眼前这场新型冠状病毒特大危机将如何结束？ 我不知道，其他人也说不清。 因此更好的做法莫过于反思一下它是如何开始的，如果能搞明白这个问题，我们也许就更可能避免下一场疫情的爆发。 当前的危机并非首例。 2003年初，另一种冠状病毒（SARS）突然从中国南部蔓延到整个东南亚地区，只不过最终被遏制在了那个区域。 后来我们得知SARS早已在华南地区传播了一段时间，但当时中国官员甚至都不愿承认其存在并发出警告，更别提采取适当措施加以遏制了。 等到疫情蔓延到香港这个全球重要金融中心之后人们才拉响了警报。 尽管如此，各方在不久之后便采取了协调一致的国际行动。 该区域的航班数量急剧减少，许多地方被围蔽了起来。 当时世界卫生组织的领导人批评中国反应迟钝，而中国卫生部长则被免职。 时年7月初世卫组织宣布危机解除，撤销了其对多个限制性措施的余下各项建议，世界也恢复了常态。 既然能在2003年取得如此成就，那为何我们会在2020年一败涂地？ 针对该问题的任何答案都将是暂定的，因为我们对于新型冠状病毒本身或疫情爆发前几个月的实际状况仍然知之甚少。 然而我认为有四个因素可能有助于解释现在和当时之间的区别。 首先，中国当局在意识到实际状况，发出警报并着手采取果断行动的整个过程中耗费了一些时间。 据我们所知新型冠状病毒于2019年11月中旬首次现身中国，随后12月中旬被发现在武汉蔓延（当时相关报告已经开始在台湾流传 ） ， 最后在2019年12月31日中国向世卫组织发出警告说可能会爆发一场疫情。 在最开始那几周武汉地方当局一直试图掩盖疫情，包括对北京中央政府隐瞒不报。 我们可能永远无法确知武汉官员蒙混了多少时间，但事实是中国当局在首次向世卫组织报告后又等了三周时间才封锁了湖北省。 那时许多民众已经开始回家过年并将新型冠状病毒传播到了中国其他地区（与此同时武汉依然允许进行街头庆祝活动 ） 。 而导致这场危机与2003年不同的第二个因素是新型冠状病毒似乎比SARS感染性更强，并因此导致中国这种拖后腿行为的后果被大幅放大。 在病毒最初出现的5~7周以及世卫组织发出警报后的几周内，当时世界其他地区还未能采取任何行动，新型冠状病毒得以传播比SARS传播得更远更广，因此也更致命。 第三个相关因素是2019~2020年的世界要比2002~2003年时相互关联程度更高。 武汉市拥有1100万人口，而这座广泛融入了全球供应链的内陆城市甚至有“中国芝加哥”之称。 在过去几十年间这座城市已发展成为一个主要物资交通枢纽，在因疫情封城之前每周有六班航班从此地飞往巴黎（还有五班飞往罗马，三班往伦敦 ） ， 还有频繁的直飞旧金山和纽约航线，因为武汉发生的事情所造成的影响可不仅限于当地。 而最后一个不可忽视的因素则是地缘政治维度。 世界在病毒危机爆发前的相当长一段时间内已经陷入了持续对抗和混乱状态。 在2003年时国际社会迅速联手协调联合应对行动是件自然而然的事情，但到了2020年这种做法竟然连一份方案都无法形成。 甚至在病毒已经全球传播之后美国特朗普政府仍然矢口否认。 时至今日该国就连一点展现全球领导力的姿态都不愿做出。 而美国对其传统角色的历史性退让也已经蔓延到了大多数已经确立的全球合作机制上。 虽然世界卫生组织于3月11日宣布新型冠状病毒已经进入全球大流行状态时可能为时已晚，但是美国及其他主要国家令人迷惑且毫无章法的应对显然让事情变得更加糟糕。 我的初步结论是这四个因素共同解释了为何这一事件要比SARS疫情严重得多。 一种新面世的冠状病毒使世界陷入了一场近代以来闻所未闻的大型危机。 对此我们应该思考这对全球治理来说意味着什么。 在此我想重复一遍，没有人知道这场危机将如何结束，但是通过了解它是如何开始的，我们也许可以预防或至少缓解下一场危机。"

            "Europe’s Non-Deal of the Century BRUSSELS – As Europe picks over the ruins of the mega-merger that would have created a world-beating new aerospace and defense giant, questions are being asked about the inglorious role that the European Union played in the fiasco. The European Commission’s failure to champion the $50 billion merger of the Franco-German European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company (EADS), owner of Airbus, and the United Kingdom’s BAE Systems is being seen as a crucial factor in the deal’s collapse. The integration of the two high-tech aviation and avionics leaders had looked like an EU-inspired blueprint for industrial success. For several years, EU leaders have been urging the consolidation of Europe’s defense industries, so the proposed deal – which originated in the corporate boardrooms of EADS and BAE Systems – looked like an answer to their calls. Yet both the Commission and the European Parliament kept silent and withheld the political support that might have ensured that the deal went through. A timely reminder by EU leaders of the strategic importance of the aerospace sector would have helped allay many of the misgivings in Berlin, and to a lesser degree in London, that ultimately sank the deal. Aviation, like defense, is the sharpest of the R&D cutting edges available to advanced countries, and regularly produces key technological breakthroughs. Nationalist squabbles over the details of the merger would surely have been attenuated by a statesmanlike intervention from the Commission in Brussels. It was therefore a bizarre coincidence that the merger’s collapse came on the day that the Commission unveiled its new industrial strategy for regaining Europe’s competitive edge in the face of Asian and North American competition. One of the most powerful arguments for the EADS-BAE marriage had been the expectation of industry analysts that within 20 years China will challenge Airbus and Boeing in the global aviation market, while also creating a powerful new defense industry. That scenario now looks all the more likely. Why, then, did the European Commission remain silent? The answer appears to be that it feared negative reactions from the three governments involved in the merger talks, and believed that its own authority would suffer from any public rebuff. The persistent rumor circulating among defense company executives is that soon after news of the proposed merger leaked, the weekly commissioners’ meeting chaired by Commission President José Manuel Barroso was enjoined to keep silent on the matter in order to avoid any potential dangers. Whether true or not, the important point is that the merger transcended national considerations, and the European Commission had a duty to involve itself. The EU’s executive body is meant to be the driving force behind Europe’s efforts to revive laggard industries and fight to reverse the long-term economic decline that the eurozone crisis appears to presage. Nobody is arguing that the Commission is responsible for the deal’s unhappy end – only that it should have rallied support for it. The significance of the merger’s collapse is now becoming clear to observers across Europe, especially in Germany, where the media have been extremely critical of how “negative politics” sealed the proposed merger’s fate. With the EU in the throes of the seemingly endless eurozone sovereign-debt crisis and facing a looming debate over its future decision-making architecture, the collapse of the EADS-BAE merger will be no more than a footnote in the history books. But it may be said to mark the point when the European Commission openly acknowledged that it has become little more than a secretariat to EU governments. That is a far cry from the political powerhouse that some Europeans fear – and for which others still hope.",
            "欧洲世纪性交易的失败 布鲁塞尔 — — 随着欧洲在本应缔造出令世人震惊的全新航空航天及国防巨头的巨型合并所遗留的废墟上挑挑拣拣，人们不禁要问欧盟在这场惨败中究竟扮演了哪些不光彩的角色。 欧盟委员会未能支持空客所有者法德欧洲航空防务及航天公司（EADS）及英国BAE系统公司案值500亿美元的合并，这被外界普遍视为此次交易失败的关键因素。 这两家航空和航空电子技术领导企业的合并曾视作为欧盟工业腾飞的创意蓝图。 若干年来，欧盟领导人一直敦促整合欧洲国防工业，于是此次由EADS和BAE系统公司董事会提出的合并议案就像在响应他们的号召。 但欧盟委员会和欧洲议会却不约而同地选择保持沉默，没有提供确保此次交易顺利达成所需的政治支持。 由欧盟领导人出面及时提醒人们航空航天产业的战略重要性或许有助于打消柏林抱有的众多疑虑，但对最终否决交易的伦敦却起不到多少作用。 航空和国防一样位列先进国家尖端科技研发的最前沿，往往能够产生关键性的技术突破。 布鲁塞尔欧盟委员会的政治干预原本应当可以弱化由合并细节所引发的民族主义争吵。 于是成就了一个奇怪的巧合，即合并失败和欧盟委员会公布其在面对亚洲和北美竞争时重新夺回欧洲竞争优势的全新产业战略就发生在同一天。 EADS与BAE联姻最有力的理由是行业分析家预测在20年内，中国将在成就强大的全新国防工业的同时，对空客和波音在全球航空市场的地位形成挑战。 目前来看这样的情况更有可能出现。 既然如此，欧盟委员会为什么保持沉默？ 答案似乎是担心涉事的三国政府参与合并谈判可能带来的消极反应，并且深信任何公众抗拒情绪将会有损于委员会自身的权威。 国防公司高管圈内一直流传着这样的谣言，即在合并提案消息泄露后，由委员会主席若泽·曼努埃尔·巴罗佐主持的委员会每周例会责成对此事件保持沉默，以避免陷入可能引发的麻烦。 无论传言是真是假，重要的是合并超越了国家的考量范畴，欧盟委员会有责任参与其中。 欧盟执行机构本就应该推动欧洲复苏其落后产业并力争扭转欧元区危机似乎预示的长期经济衰退的努力。 没有人认为欧洲委员会应当对交易不圆满的结果负责，只是说它本来应当给予相应的支持。 欧洲各国（特别是德国）观察家现在已经意识到合并失败将会产生的重大后果。 德国媒体一直对“消极政治”如何决定合并提案的命运持有极端批评的态度。 在欧盟正在承受看似无休无止的欧元区主权债务危机所���来的痛苦并且对未来决策架构的探讨已经迫在眉睫的情况下，EADS和BAE的合并失败恐怕仅仅是历史书上的一个脚注。 但可以说这次合并失败标志着欧盟委员会公开承认自己已沦为欧盟各国政府的秘书处。 这与某些欧洲人所担心的强力政治机构相去甚远 — — 强力政治机构仍然是有些人所追求的目标。"

            "Should Central Banks Target Employment? WASHINGTON, DC – On December 12, US Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke announced that the Fed will keep interest rates at close to zero until the unemployment rate falls to 6.5%, provided inflation expectations remain subdued. While the Fed’s governing statutes, unlike those of the European Central Bank, explicitly include a mandate to support employment, the announcement marked the first time that the Fed tied its interest-rate policy to a numerical employment target. It is a welcome breakthrough, and one that should be emulated by others – not least the ECB. Central banks’ statutes differ in terms of the objectives that they set for monetary policy. All include price stability. Many add a reference to general economic conditions, including growth and employment or financial stability. Some give the central bank the authority to set an inflation target unilaterally; others stipulate coordination with the government in setting the target. There is no recent example, however, of a major central bank setting a numerical employment target. This should change, as the size of the employment challenge facing the advanced economies becomes more apparent. Weak labor markets, low inflation, and debt overhang suggest that a fundamental re-ordering of priorities is in order. In Japan, Shinzo Abe, the incoming prime minister, is signaling the same set of concerns, although he seems to be proposing a “minimum” inflation target for the Bank of Japan, rather than a link to growth or employment. The spread of global value-chains that integrate hundreds of millions of developing-country workers into the global economy, as well as new labor-saving technologies, imply little chance of cost-push wage inflation. Likewise, the market for long-term bonds indicates extremely low inflation expectations (of course, interest rates are higher in cases of perceived sovereign default or re-denomination risk, such as in Southern Europe, but that has nothing to do with inflation). Moreover, the deleveraging underway since the 2008 financial implosion could be easier if inflation were moderately higher for a few years, a debate the International Monetary Fund encouraged a year ago. Together with these considerations, policymakers should take into account the tremendous human and economic costs of high unemployment, ranging from the millions of shattered lives, skills erosion, and disappearance of opportunities for an entire generation, to the dead-weight loss of idle human resources. Is the failure to ensure that millions of young people acquire the skills required to participate in the economy not as great a liability for a society as a large stock of public debt? Nowhere is this reordering of priorities more needed than in the eurozone. Yet, strangely, it is the Fed, not the ECB, that has set an unemployment target. The US unemployment rate has declined to around 7.7% and the current-account deficit is close to $500 billion, while eurozone unemployment is at a record high, near 12%, and the current account shows a surplus approaching $100 billion. If the ECB’s inflation target were 3%, rather than close to but below 2%, and Germany, with the world’s largest current-account surplus, encouraged 6% wage growth and tolerated 4% inflation – implying modest real-wage growth in excess of expected productivity gains – the eurozone adjustment process would become less politically and economically costly. Indeed, the policy calculus in Northern Europe greatly underestimates the economic losses due to the disruptions imposed on the South by excessive austerity and wage deflation. The resulting high levels of youth unemployment, health problems, and idle production capacity also all have a substantial impact on demand for imports from the North. Contrary to conventional wisdom, the ECB’s legal mandate would allow such a re-ordering of priorities, as, with reference to the ECB, the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union states that “The primary (emphasis added) objective of the European System of Central Banks…shall be to maintain price stability,” and there is another part of the Treaty dealing with general eurozone economic policies that emphasizes employment. This would seem not to preclude a temporary complementary employment objective for the ECB at a time of exceptional challenge. Moreover, the ECB has the authority to set the eurozone-wide inflation target, and could set it higher for two or three years, without any treaty violation. The real problem is the current political attitude in Germany. Somehow, the memory of hyperinflation in the early 1920’s seems scarier than that of massive unemployment in the early 1930’s, although it was the latter that fueled the rise of Nazism. Maybe the upcoming German elections will allow progressive forces to clarify what is at stake for Germany and Europe – indeed, the entire world. In a more global context, none of this is to dismiss the longer-term dangers of inflation. In most countries, at most times, inflation should be kept very low – and central banks should anchor inflation expectations with a stable long-term target, although the alternative of targeting nominal GDP deserves to be discussed. Moreover, monetary policy cannot be a long-term substitute for structural reforms and sustainable budgets. Long periods of zero real interest rates carry the danger of asset bubbles, misallocation of resources, and unintended effects on income inequality, as recent history – not least in the US and Japan – demonstrates. For the coming 2-3 years, however, particularly in Europe, the need for deleveraging, the costs of widespread joblessness, and the risk of social collapse make the kind of temporary unemployment target announced by the Fed highly desirable.",
            "中央银行应该把目标定在就业上吗？ 华盛顿—12月12日，美联储主席伯南克宣布美联储将一直保持利率近零水平直至失业率降到6.5 % ， 只要通胀预期保持可控。 美联储的治理权限 — — 与欧洲央行不同 — — 明文规定包括支持就业的指令权，但伯南克的话是标志着美联储第一次将其利率政策与就业数字目标挂钩。 这是一个值得欢迎的突破，应该被其他央行所效仿 — — 不仅仅是欧洲央行。 中央银行的权限因它们为货币政策设定的目标的不同而不同。 所有央行的目标都包括价格稳定。 不少央行还加上了总体经济状况（包括增长和就业或是金融稳定）内容。 一些国家给予央行单方面决定通胀目标的权力，一些国家则要求央行与政府合作设定这一目标。 但是，近年来从未有主要国家的央行设定就业数字目标。 这应该发生改变，因为发达国家所面临的就业挑战规模日益显著。 疲软的劳动力市场、低通胀和债务积压意味着需要将对各项任务来一次根本性重新排序。 在日本，即将出任首相的安倍晋三也释放出同样的信号，尽管他准备为日本银行设定一个“最低”通胀目标，而不是与通胀或就业挂钩。 全球价值链的扩大将数亿发展中国家工人以及劳动力节约型技术与全球经济融为一体，这意味着成本推动型工资通胀几无可能发生。 类似地，长期债券市场表明，通胀预期极低（当然，利率在人们感觉存在主权违约风险和重新计价风险时会有所增加，南欧便是明证，但这和通胀无��� ） 。 此外，如果通胀在未来数年略有上升，2008年金融危机爆发以来的去杠杆化也会更加容易，IMF在一年前就鼓励讨论这样做。 除了这些考虑，决策者还应该考虑高失业带来的巨大人力和经济成本，包括数百万对生活失去信心的人、技能损失、一整代人丧失机会、闲置人力资源的平白浪费等。 对于一个对社会来说是一笔大负债但更是一笔巨额公共债务存量的经济，其失败能否保证千百万年轻人能够获得参与其中的技能？ 最需要对任务重要性重新排序非欧元区莫属。 但是，奇怪的是，美联储而不是欧洲央行设定了通胀目标。 美国失业率已降至7.7 % ， 经常项目赤字接近5 000亿美元，而欧元区失业率达到了创纪录的近12 % ， 经常项目盈余近1 000亿美元。 如果欧洲央行的通胀目标是3%而不是接近但低于2 % ， 且世界最大经常项目盈余国德国将工资提高6%并容忍4%的通胀 — — 这意味着真实工资增长略高于预期生产率增长 — — 则欧元区调整过程的政治和经济代价将会更小。 事实上，北欧的政策算盘大大地低估了过度紧缩和工资通缩给南欧造成的影响以及由此产生的经济损失。 随之而来的年轻人高失业率、医疗问题和产能闲置也对北欧出口商品需求带来了巨大冲击。 与传统智慧相反，欧洲央行的法定权力允许这样的任务优先顺序重排，因为对于欧洲央行 ， 《 欧盟运行条约》规定“欧洲中央银行体系的主要（特别强调）目标是 … … 保持价格稳定 ” ， 而对于强调就业的欧元区总体经济政策，该条约另有条文规定。 这似乎并不妨碍欧洲央行在面临重大挑战时暂时补充以就业目标。 此外，欧洲央行有设定泛欧元区通胀目标的权力，可以在两三年内将其设在较高水平而不违反条约。 真正的问题在于德国的政治态度。 然而，20世纪20年代恶性通胀的记忆似乎比20世纪30年代初大规模失业的记忆更为惨痛，尽管后者才是导致纳粹上台的原因。 或许即将到来的德国选举将让进步力量澄清德国和欧洲 — — 事实上是全世界 — — 所面临的危机。 从全球角度看，所有这些都没有消除长期通胀危险。 在大部分时候的大部分国家，通胀都应该维持在极低水平，央行也应该通过稳定的长期目标锚定通胀预期，尽管如此，将目标改为名义GDP的替代方案也值得考虑。 此外，货币政策不可能长期代替结构性改革和可持续预算。 长期零真实利率会带来资产泡沫、资源配置不当和意料之外的收入不平等等风险，最近的历史（不仅仅是美国和日本）证明了这一点。 但是，在未来2—3年，特别是在欧洲，去杠杆化的需要、失业高企的成本以及社会崩溃的风险让美联储所宣布的临时性失业目标显得极为合理。"

            "Mario Draghi’s Opiate of the Markets CHICAGO – From the standpoint of European stability, the Italian elections could not have delivered a worse outcome. Italy’s parliament is divided among three mutually incompatible political forces, with none strong enough to rule alone. Worse, one of these forces, which won 25% of the vote, is an anti-euro populist party, while another, a Euro-skeptic group led by former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, received close to 30% support, giving anti-euro parties a clear majority. Despite these scary results, the interest-rate spread for Italian government bonds relative to German bunds has increased by only 40 basis points since the election. In July 2012, when a pro-European, austerity-minded government was running the country, with the well-respected economist Mario Monti in charge, the spread reached 536 basis points. Today, with no government and little chance that a decent one will be formed soon, the spread sits at 314 points. So, are markets bullish about Italy, or have they lost their ability to assess risk? A recent survey of international investors conducted by Morgan Stanley suggests that they are not bullish. Forty-six percent of the respondents said that the most likely outcome for Italy is an interim administration and new elections. And they regard this outcome as the worst-case scenario, one that implies a delay of any further economic measures, deep policy uncertainty, and the risk of an even less favorable electoral outcome. The survey also clearly indicated why the interest-rate spread for Italian government bonds is not much wider: the perceived backstop provided by the European Central Bank. Although investors believe that the backstop is unlikely to be used, its mere presence dissuades them from betting against Italy. In other words, the “outright monetary transactions” (OMT) scheme announced by ECB President Mario Draghi last July has served as the proverbial “bazooka” – a gun so powerful that it does not need to be used. Then-US Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson sought a bazooka during the 2008 financial crisis. He failed, because he believed that even a fake gun would work if it looked scary enough. Not falling for the trick, speculators repeatedly called his bluff. Draghi, with his famous pledge to do “whatever it takes” to ensure the euro’s survival, succeeded where Paulson did not. After all, he controls the monetary spigot. But even Draghi’s bazooka is partly a bluff. Draghi designed it to relieve the ECB of the huge political responsibility of deciding when to save a country from default. For this reason, triggering the OMT mechanism requires the unanimous consent of eurozone governments. But, if the bazooka is needed, how likely is it to be fired before the German election in September? The Morgan Stanley survey did not ask this question, probably because everybody knows the answer: not likely at all. Thus, markets remain calm because they expect the bazooka not to be needed. In that case, the fact that it cannot be triggered easily does not pose a significant problem. Its presence is enough to support a benign self-fulfilling prophecy. In other words, Draghi’s bazooka has anesthetized markets, impairing their ability to assess risk. But as with all anesthetics, Draghi’s cannot and will not last forever. Either the underlying problem is fixed before the patient wakes up, or the pain will be devastating. The investors surveyed by Morgan Stanley put the chance of a renewed crisis in Italy below 25%. I believe that it is higher than 50%. Even after Germany’s election, I am not sure that the government will be willing to support an Italian rescue program without asking for major guarantees concerning the objectives – and even the composition – of Italy’s ruling coalition. Indeed, German Chancellor Angela Merkel will face a serious dilemma following her likely re-election. Without strict conditionality, she would risk shifting the domestic consensus in favor of Germany’s emerging Euro-skeptic mood. But, by insisting on such conditionality, she would trigger a huge political crisis in Europe. If the German government gets to decide who governs Italy, why should Italians bother voting? The eurozone will look like a German protectorate, rather than a voluntary union of sovereign countries. The political backlash would be enormous. The only hope is that the eurozone makes strong progress toward establishing fiscal-redistribution mechanisms, such as European unemployment insurance, before Draghi’s anesthetic wears off. Otherwise, Europe will face a very rude awakening indeed.",
            "市场的德拉吉鸦片 芝加哥—站在欧洲稳定的立场看，意大利选举结果可谓坏到了极点。 意大利议会分裂为三个互不相容的政治阵营，没有一个强大到足以单独执政。 更糟糕的是，其中一个获得了25%选票的阵营是反欧元民粹主义政党，另外一个支持率近30%的阵营是前总理贝卢斯科尼领导的欧元怀疑派，这使得反欧元政党占据明显多数。 尽管结果令人担忧，但选举以来意大利政府债券相对德国国债的利差只上升了40个基点。 2012年6月，执政意大利的是紧缩派政府，政府首脑是德高望重的经济学家蒙蒂，此时的利差为536个基点。 如今，陷入无政府状态、且没有任何迹象表明会在不久的将来形成得体政府的意大利，利差只有314个基点。 那么，是市场看好意大利，还是市场失去了评估风险的能力？ 摩根士丹利进行的最新国际投资者调查表明，投资者并不看好意大利。 46%受访者声称意大利最有可能的结果是过渡政府+新选举。 他们认为这一结果堪称最坏情形，意味着进一步经济措施将被推迟、政策面临极大的不稳定性，并有可能形成更加不利的选举结果。 调查还明确显示了为何意大利政府债券利差没有显著加大：人们感到欧洲央行在支持意大利。 尽管投资者认为这一支持不可能成为实际动作，但仅仅是有支持存在便足以促使他们不再看空意大利。 换句话说，欧洲央行行长德拉吉去年7月宣布的“直接货币交易 ” （ OMT）机制已经成了“火箭炮”的代名词 — — 这个武器威力如此巨大，以致于根本不必真正拿出来使用。 时任美国财政部长保尔森在2008年金融危机期间就祭出过类似的火箭炮。 他失败了，因为他认为只要气势汹汹，就算是假枪也能奏效。 投资者并不买账，一再戳穿了他的虚张声势。 德拉吉的著名承诺 — — “不惜一切代价”确保欧元生存正是成功在保尔森的失败之处。 毕竟，他控制着货币龙头。 但即使是德拉吉的火箭炮，也有一半是虚张声势。 德拉吉的火箭炮是用来纾解欧洲央行决定何时拯救一国走出违约困境的政治责任压力的。 出于这一理由，出发OMT机制要求欧元区各国政府的一致同意。 但是，如果火箭炮真的需要开炮，有多少可能能够在9月德国选举之前实现？ 摩根士丹利的调查并没有问道这一问题，其原因也许在于所有人都知道答案：根本没有可能。 因此，市场之所以保持冷静，是因为市场预期德拉吉的火箭炮不会真的使用。 果真如此的话，火箭炮不会轻易发射这一事实并不构成严重问题。 它的存在已足以支持良性的自我实现预言。 换句话说，德拉吉的火箭炮麻醉了市场，是它丧失了评估风险的能力。 但它的麻醉作用再大，也无法也不会永远持续。 要么根本问题在耐心耗尽前得到解决，要么发生灾难性的痛苦事件。 摩根士丹利所调查的投资者认为意大利危机重新爆发的几率不到25 % 。 我认为高于50 % 。 即使在德国选举之后，我仍不确定德国政府愿意支持意大利援助计划而不要求获得关于意大利执政联盟目标 — — 甚至其组成 — — 的重大承诺。 事实上，德国总理默克尔将在可能的连任后面临一个严重的两难。 如果不要求严苛的条件，她可能会让国内一致观点倒向新崛起的怀疑欧元派。 如果德国政府能够决定谁来治理意大利，那���意大利人还要选举干什么？ 欧元区则像是德国的保护国，而不是主权国家组成的自愿联盟。 其政治反响将会极其激烈。 唯一的希望是欧元区在德拉吉的麻药失去药效前朝着成立财政再分配机制的方向去的重大进步，比如形成欧洲失业保险制度。 否则的话，欧洲将面临极其痛苦的未来。"

            "China’s American Bailout? ZURICH – The twenty-first-century economy has thus far been shaped by capital flows from China to the United States – a pattern that has suppressed global interest rates, helped to reflate the developed world’s leverage bubble, and, through its impact on the currency market, fueled China’s meteoric rise. But these were no ordinary capital flows. Rather than being driven by direct or portfolio investment, they came primarily from the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), as it amassed $3.5 trillion in foreign reserves – largely US Treasury securities. The fact that a single institution wields so much influence over global macroeconomic trends has caused considerable anxiety, with doomsayers predicting that doubts about US debt sustainability will force China to sell off its holdings of US debt. This would drive up interest rates in the US and, ultimately, could trigger the dollar’s collapse. But selling off US Treasury securities, it was argued, was not in China’s interest, given that it would drive up the renminbi’s exchange rate against the dollar, diminishing the domestic value of China’s reserves and undermining the export sector’s competitiveness. Indeed, a US defense department report last year on the national-security implications of China’s holdings of US debt concluded that “attempting to use US Treasury securities as a coercive tool would have limited effect and likely would do more harm to China than to the [US].” To describe the symbiotic relationship between China’s export-led GDP growth and America’s excessive consumption, the economic historians Niall Ferguson and Moritz Schularick coined the term “Chimerica.” The invocation of the chimera of Greek mythology – a monstrous, fire-breathing amalgam of lion, goat, and dragon – makes the term all the more appropriate, given that Chimerica has generated massive and terrifying distortions in the global economy that cannot be corrected without serious consequences. In 2009, these distortions led Ferguson and Schularick to forecast Chimerica’s collapse – a prediction that seems to be coming true. With the reserves’ long-term effects on China’s internal economic dynamics finally taking hold, selling off foreign-exchange reserves is now in China’s interest. Over the last decade, the vast quantities of short-term capital that were being pumped into China’s banking system drove commercial banks and other financial institutions to expand credit substantially, especially through the shadow-banking system, leading to a massive credit bubble and severe over-investment. In order to manage the resulting increase in risk, China’s new leaders are now refusing to provide further liquidity injections, as well as curbing loans to unprofitable sectors. But these efforts could trigger a financial crisis, requiring China to initiate a major recapitalization of the banking system. In such a scenario, non-performing loans in China’s banking system would probably amount to roughly $1 trillion. The most obvious means of recapitalizing China’s banks would be to inject renminbi-denominated government debt into the banking sector. But China’s total public debt, including off-balance-sheet local-government financing vehicles, probably amounts to around 70% of GDP already. Despite debate over the details, the conclusion of Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff – that a high debt/GDP ratio can inhibit economic growth – remains widely accepted; so it is unlikely that raising the debt ratio to 100% would be in China’s long-term interest. Even if China’s leaders decided that they had the necessary fiscal latitude to pursue such a strategy, they probably would not, owing to the risk of inflation, which, perhaps more than any other economic variable, tends to lead to social unrest. Given this, in the event of a crisis, China would most likely have to begin selling off its massive store of US debt. Fortunately for China, the negative consequences of such a move would probably be far less severe than previously thought. To be sure, an injection of US Treasuries into the banking sector, and their subsequent conversion to renminbi, would still strengthen China’s currency. But the rise would most likely be offset by capital outflows, as looser capital controls would enable savers to escape the financial crisis. Moreover, even if the renminbi became stronger in the short term, China is no longer as dependent on maintaining export competitiveness as it once was, given that, excluding assembly and reprocessing, exports now contribute less than 5% of China’s GDP. Against this background, the US Federal Reserve, rather than focusing only on “tapering” its monthly purchases of long-term securities (quantitative easing), must prepare itself for a potential sell-off of US debt. Given that a Fed-funded recapitalization of China’s banking system would negate the impact of monetary policy at home, driving up borrowing costs and impeding GDP growth, the Fed should be ready to sustain quantitative easing in the event of a Chinese financial crisis. After spending years attempting to insulate the US economy from the upshot of its own banking crisis, the Fed may ultimately be forced to bail out China’s banks, too. This would fundamentally redefine – and, one hopes, rebalance – US-China relations.",
            "中国的 美国援助？ 苏黎世—到目前为止，21世纪的经济由中国向美国的资本流决定着 — — 这一模式压低了全球利率，帮助发达世界杠杆泡沫再次膨胀，并通过在货币市场的影响助长了中国的迅速崛起。 但这不是普通的资本流。 它不是由直接投资或组合投资驱动的，而主要来自中国人民银行，后者囤积了3.5万亿美元外汇储备，其中大部分是美国国债。 一个机构对全球宏观经济趋势施加了如此之大的影响，这引起了大规模的不安，末日预言家纷纷表示对美国债务可持续性的怀疑将迫使美国甩卖其持有的美国债务。 这将推高美国利率，并最终触发美元的崩溃。 这一观点指出，甩卖美国国债并不符合中国的利益，因为这会推高人民币对美元汇率，降低中国储备的本币价值，破坏出口部门的竞争力。 事实上，去年美国国防部的一百分报告分析了中国所持美国债务对国家安全的影响，结论是“试图将美国国债作为强制工具使用效果有限，对中国的危害比对[美国]更大 。 ” 经济史学家弗格森（Niall Ferguson）和舒拉里克（Moritz Schularick）创造了“中美国 ” （ Chimerica）一词来形容中国的出口导向型GDP增长和美国的过度消费之间的共生关系。 希腊神话式的幻想 — — 狮子、山羊和龙的混合体喷火怪兽 — — 让这个词更加合适了，因为中美国给全球经济带来了巨大的、令人恐怖的扭曲，纠正这一扭曲必然会带来严重后果。 2009年，这一扭曲促使弗格森和舒拉里克预言中国将崩溃 — — 这一预言似乎即将实现。 随着外汇储备对中国内部经济动态的长期影响最终显现，如今甩卖外汇储备已经符合中国的利益。 在过去十年中，大量涌入中国银行系统的短期资本促使商业银行和其他金融机构大量扩张信用，特别是通过影子银行系统进行扩张，这导致了巨大的信用泡沫和严重的过度投资。 为了应对因此增加的风险，如今中国新领导人拒绝进一步注入流动性，并遏制贷款流向无盈利能力的部门。 但这些措施可能引发金融危机，使中国不得不进行大规模的银行系统资本重组。 在这一情形下，中国银行系统的不良贷款可能会达到1万亿美元左右。 对中资银行进行资本重组最显而易见的方式是向银行部门注入人民币计价的政府债务。 但中国总公债水平 — — 包括表外的地方政府融资平台 — — 可能已经达到了GDP的70%左右。 尽管细节存在争议，但莱因哈特（Carmen Reinhart）和罗格夫（Kenneth Rogoff）的结论 — — 高债务/GDP比率会抑制经济增长 — — 仍被广泛接受；因此，将让债务比率升至100%显然不符合中国的长期利益。 即使中国领导人认为他们拥有必要的财政空间事实这一战略，他们也有可能因为通胀风险而不这么做。 通胀风险比其他任何经济变量更有可能导致社会动荡。 基于此，若发生危机，中国极有可能不得不开始甩卖其手中的巨量美国债务。 对中国来说，幸运的是这一动作的消极后果可能远没有此前设想的严重。 平心而论，将美国国债注入银行部门并在随后转换为人民币仍可以强化中国货币。 但因为较松的资本管制使储蓄者可以逃避金融危机，升值极有可能被资本外流抵消。 此外，即使人民币在短期有所升值，中国也不再能像从前那样依赖于维持出口竞争力，因为剔除组装和再加工业务，出口目前只占中国GDP的5 % 。 与这一背景相对的是，美联储不能专注于依靠“减弱”其每月长期证券购买量（量化宽松 ） ， 还必须做好准备面对可能发生的美国债务甩卖。 美联储提供融资的中国银行系统的资本重组将使货币政策在国内失效，推高借贷成本并阻碍GDP增长，因此美联储应该做好准备在中国爆发金融危机时维持量化宽松。 美联储花了多年时间让美国经济不再受其自身银行危机的影响，到头来还得被迫援助中国的银行。 这将从根本上重塑中美关系 — — 我们希望是再平衡。"

            "Why the Fed Should Postpone Rate Hikes JACKSON HOLE, WYOMING – As central bankers from around the world gather this week in Jackson Hole for the Federal Reserve’s annual Economic Policy Symposium, one key topic of discussion will be the current global stock-market turmoil. There are many reasons for these gyrations, but the expectation that the Fed will start to raise interest rates – perhaps as early as September – is clearly one of them. The arguments for a rate hike are valid. The United States’ economy is gaining traction. The International Monetary Fund forecasts 3% annual growth in 2015 and 2016, accompanied by inflation rates of 0.1% and 1.5%, respectively. When an economy is normalizing, it is reasonable to reduce expansionary measures, such as those introduced after the crisis of 2008. Because the Fed has clearly communicated that it will move gradually toward less expansionary policies, its credibility would be damaged if it did not follow through. But there are strong reasons for the Fed to postpone interest-rate hikes and to keep monetary policy expansionary over the coming quarters. For starters, the US recovery remains weak. Historically, 3% growth during a recovery is far from impressive. In other recent recoveries, growth often hit 4% or even 5% when increased capacity utilization pushed up productivity and investment. Over the past three decades, the US has been able to grow at an average annual rate of around 2.5%. Some attribute relatively slow growth to demographic factors, which have reduced the labor force, as well as to weak productivity levels, which have been low. But America’s potential output may be underestimated, and its inflation propensity exaggerated. The US labor market works well. Unemployment is down to 5%, with no signs of overheating. The employment cost index suggests that wage increases so far have been surprisingly low. One reason for this is that labor-market flexibility increased during the recovery. Self-employment, short-term contracts, or part-time arrangements account for many of the jobs that have been created over the past few years. Full-time jobs with comprehensive benefits are now much rarer. This ongoing “Uberization” of the US labor market means that the balance in the wage-setting process has shifted. As a result, it will take longer for demand to feed through to wages and inflation than in the past. Moreover, the economy is undergoing an ongoing technological shift stemming from digitization and globalization. Estimates from Citigroup indicate that almost half of all jobs will be disrupted in the coming decades. Jobs that require lower skills and less training are particularly vulnerable; but it is also clear that many other occupational categories – including administration, accounting, logistics, banking, and various service activities – are likely to be affected. Companies will be able to reduce their headcount and production costs while improving customer service, which, like Uberization, will affect the wage-setting process. Central bankers, I believe, are underestimating the impact of this structural shift. In the more tech-oriented economies, like the US, the United Kingdom, and the Nordic countries, there is a risk that traditional macroeconomic models will overestimate the cost pressure from labor. Another reason why the Fed should postpone a rate hike is that financial turmoil in emerging markets, particularly China, could have a substantial impact on the global economy, with some clear implications for the US economy. In particular, lower energy and commodity prices are likely to dampen inflationary pressure. When inflation is low for a long period, inflation expectations also tend to be low. Add falling commodity and energy prices to the mix and there is a risk that inflation expectations will remain too low to sustain a balanced recovery. The global implications of lower emerging-market currencies are also likely to be deflationary. The direct impact is that a stronger dollar reduces the cost of imported goods. The indirect effect, which might be substantial, is that cost-competitive light manufacturing in emerging markets increases. That would reinforce the deflationary pressure from globalization for years to come. There is also a risk of greater currency-market volatility if the Fed jumps the gun in raising rates. The Fed’s unconventional monetary policies have been necessary for the US. But, because they flooded global markets with liquidity, large portfolio flows have moved into emerging-market countries, whose currencies often are not as liquid as the dollar. When investment moves back into dollars, the currency fluctuations in these less liquid markets can become excessive. The Fed clearly has a responsibility to consider how its policy decisions affect the global financial system. Excessive currency volatility is not in America’s interest, not least because large exchange-rate depreciations in emerging markets would amplify the effects of globalization on US jobs, wages, and inflation, particularly as weaker foreign currencies make outsourcing a more economically viable solution. Another reason for the Fed to reconsider hiking rates is that the legitimacy of the Bretton Woods institutions depends on a well-functioning global financial system. The global economy’s center of gravity is moving to Asia, Latin America, and Africa, but the IMF and the World Bank still seem to mirror the reality of the 1950s. If the Fed is seen as unleashing a major crisis in emerging markets, this will almost certainly do long-term damage to the global financial system. The Fed should regard lower commodity prices, reduced inflationary pressures, changes in the labor market, and further disruptive technological shifts as sufficiently convincing arguments to postpone a rate hike. Including the risk of excessive volatility in the global financial system tips the balance even further. There is plenty of time for the Fed to signal that its policy stance has shifted, and the conclave in Jackson Hole is an excellent opportunity to start that communication. If the facts have changed, the policy implications must also change. The greatest loss of credibility always comes when policymakers try to ignore changing realities.",
            "为何美联储应该暂停升息 杰克森霍尔，怀俄明州—本周，全球央行行长将齐聚杰克森霍尔（Jackson Hole ） ， 出席一年一度的美联储经济政策讨论会。 讨论会的一个重要议题是当前股市动荡。 动荡的原因有很多，但预期美联储将开始升息 — — 也许从9月份就会开始 — — 显然是其中之一。 支持升息的理由很充分。 美国经济正在重获动力。 国际货币基金组织（IMF）预测2015和2016年增长率为3 % ， 对应通胀率分别为0.1%和1.5 % 。 当经济开始正常化时，减少扩张政策（比如2008年危机后实施的那些）再合理不过了。 美联储早就明确表示它将逐渐减少扩张性政策，因此，如果它不那么做，信誉就会收到影响。 但有很好的理由认为美联储应该暂停升息，并在未来几个季度保持货币政策扩张。 首先，美国复苏仍然疲软。 从历史看，复苏期间3%的增长绝算不上漂亮。 在其他几次最近的复苏中，随着产能利用率的提高助推生产率和投资，增长率常常达到4%甚至5 % 。 在过去三十年中，美国能够以平均每年2.5%的速度增长。 一些人将相对较慢的增长归因于人口因素，人口因素导致劳动力减少和已然低迷的生产率水平进一步恶化。 但美国的潜在产出可能被低估，而通胀倾向被高估。 美国劳动力市场运转良好。 失业率已下降至5 % ， 没有过热迹象。 就业成本指数表明目前工资增长低得出人意料。 这一现象的一个原因是复苏期间劳动力市场弹性有所增加。 自由职业、短期合同工和兼职占了过去几年工作岗位创造的很大一部分。 如今，福利俱全的全职工作少见多了。 美国劳动力市场的这一持续的“优步化 ” （ Uberization）意味着工资决定过程的平衡已经发生了改变。 结果，需求反馈到工资和通胀所需要的时间比以前更长了。 此外，美国经济正在经历数字化和全球化带来的持续的技术变迁。 花旗集团的估算表明，在未来几十年中，近一半的工作岗位将不复存在。 技能和训练要求低的岗位尤其脆弱；但同样明确的是，许多其他岗位类别 — — 包括管理、会计、物流、银行和各种服务活动 — — 也可能受到影响。 公司可以在减少人手、降低生产成本的同时改进客户服务，这与优步化一样，也将影响工资决定过程。 我认为，央行行长低估了这一结构变迁的影响。 在更加技术导向的经济体，如美国、英国和北欧国家，一个风险是传统宏观经济模型将高估来自劳动力的成本压力。 美联储应该暂停升息的另一个原因是新兴市场（特别是中国）的金融动荡可能给全球经济造成重大冲击，美国经济也将受到明显影响。 特别是，能源和大宗商品价格下跌可能消除通胀压力。 当通胀长期保持低迷时，通胀预期也会趋于下降。 再加上大宗商品和能源价格下跌，就产生了一个风险，即，通胀压力太低而无法维持平衡复苏。 新兴市场货币贬值的全球影响也可能是通缩性的。 直接影响是强势美元增加进口品的成本。 间接影响可能更大，即成本竞争力强的新兴市场制造业的增长。 这将强化今后多年内来自全球化的通缩压力。 如果美联储抢先升息，还会带来货币市场波动扩大的风险。 美联储的非常规货币政策对美国来说是必要的。 但是，这些政策给全球市场注入了流动性，巨大的投资组合流流向了新兴市场国家，而它们的货币流动性常常不如美国。 当投资流回美元时，这些流动性较差的市场的货币就会过度波动。 美联储有责任考虑其政策决定如何影响全球金融体系。 过度货币波动不符合美国的利益，因为新兴市场的大规模汇率贬值将放大全球化对美国就业、工资和通胀的影响，特别是当外币贬值使外包在经济上更加划算时。 美联储应该重新考虑是否升息的另一个理由是布雷顿森林机构的合法性依赖全球金融体系的正常运转。 全球经济的重心正在转向亚洲、拉丁美洲和非洲，但IMF和世界银行所体现的仍然是20实际50年代的现实。 如果美联储被认为是在制造一场新兴市场大危机，那么这几乎肯定会给全球金融体系造成长期伤害。 美联储应该将大宗商品价格的下跌、通胀压力的减小、劳动力市场的变化以及未来破坏性技术变迁视为暂停升息的压倒性证据。 如果考虑到全球金融体系过度波动的风险，那么暂停升息的理由就更加充分了。 美联储有充足的时间释放信号表明其政策立场的转变，而杰克森霍尔会议便是一次开始释放这一信号的良机。 如果事实发生了改变，政策也应该改变。 信誉的最大损失永远来自决策者试图忽视变化的现实。"

            "Why the Greek Bailout Failed CAMBRIDGE – As the Greek crisis evolves, it is important to understand that a successful structural-adjustment program requires strong country ownership. Even if negotiators overcome the most recent sticking points, it will be difficult to trust in their implementation if the Greek people remain unconvinced. That has certainly been the experience so far. And without structural reform, there is little chance that the Greek economy will see sustained stability and growth – not least because official lenders are unwilling to continue extending an unreformed Greece significantly more money than it is asked to pay. (This has been the case through most of the crisis, even if one would never know it from the world press coverage.) Greece’s membership in the European Union gives its creditors significant leverage, but evidently not enough to change the fundamental calculus. Greece remains very much a sovereign country, not a sub-sovereign state. The “troika” of creditors – the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank, and the European Commission – simply do not enjoy the kind of leverage over Greece that, say, the Municipal Assistance Corporation wielded over New York City when it teetered on the edge of bankruptcy in the mid-1970s. The best structural-adjustment programs are those in which the debtor country’s government proposes the policy changes, and the IMF helps design a bespoke program and provides the political cover for its implementation. Imposing them from the outside is simply not an effective option. So, for reforms to take hold, the Greek government and its electorate must believe in them. That a country must take ownership of its reform program is not a new lesson. The IMF’s rocky relationship with Ukraine began long before the latest round of negotiations. Back in 2013, IMF staff wrote a sobering report on the organization’s experience in the country. Their conclusion, in essence, was that the government’s failure to embrace the reform process fully all but guaranteed that its program would not work. If a government is incapable of or uninterested in making the needed adjustments, the report argued, the best option is to drip money out as reforms are implemented, as is now being done in Greece. Unfortunately, that approach has not proved adequate to overcome the challenges there. Structural-reform conditions often tilt the balance between competing domestic factions, for better or for worse. If there is no will inside the country to maintain the reforms, they will quickly be undermined. Left-wing ideologues have long viewed structural-reform programs with deep suspicion, accusing international lenders like the IMF and the World Bank of being captured by neoliberal market fundamentalists. This critique has some truth in it, but is overblown. To be sure, structural reforms often favor policies like labor-market flexibility. But one should not make the mistake of viewing these interventions in black-and-white terms. Breaking down dual labor markets that are excluding young workers (as they do in much of southern Europe, including Italy and, to some extent, France) is very different from making it easier to fire all workers. Making pension systems sustainable does not amount to making them stingier. Making tax systems simpler and fairer is not the same as raising all taxes. Recently, opponents of structural reform have put forward more exotic objections – most notably the problem caused by deflation when policy interest rates are at zero. If structural reforms simply lower all wages and prices, it may indeed be difficult in the short-term to counter the drop in aggregate demand. But a similar critique could be made of any other change in policy: if it is poorly designed, it will be counter-productive. The truth is that the way forward in Europe requires achieving greater productivity. The lessons from Greece and other unsuccessful bailout programs are sobering. If a debt bailout program requires a wholesale change in a country’s economic, social, and political model, the best course of action might be to write off the private losses, rather than pour in public money to cover them. In cases like Greece, the creditors’ passion for structural reforms might be better directed at home – particularly toward improving financial regulation. The vast majority of Greeks want to stay in the EU. In an ideal world, offering financial aid in exchange for reforms might help those in the country who want to shape it into a modern European state. But given the difficulty Greece has had so far in making the necessary changes to reach that goal, it might be time to reconsider this approach to the crisis completely. In place of a program providing the country with further loans, it might make more sense to provide outright humanitarian aid – regardless of whether Greece remains fully within the eurozone.",
            "失败的希腊援助 美国剑桥—随着希腊危机的演进，一个很重要的要点是明白成功的结构调整方案需要强大的国家所有权（ownership ） 。 即使谈判者克服了最近的症结，如果说服不了希腊人民，也很难信任调整方案的实施。 显然，目前的经验就是如此。 而如果没有结构改革，希腊经济就无从实现持续稳定和增长 — — 官方贷款人不愿给予不实施改革的希腊远远多于要求它偿还的资金。 （大部分危机都是如此，尽管也许无法从全球媒体报道中了解这一点。 ） 希腊的欧盟成员资格给了其债权人很大的杠杆（leverage ） ， 但显然仍不足以改变基本面。 希腊仍然是主权国家（country）而不是次主权的邦国（state ） 。 “三驾马车”债权人 — — IMF、欧洲央行和欧盟委员会 — — 在希腊问题上并没有获得类似于20世纪70年代市政援助公司（Municipal Assistance Corporation）在纽约市濒临破产时所获得的杠杆。 最好的结构调整计划应该让债务国政府实施政策变化，并由IMF帮助设计定制方案和提供实施方案的政治掩护。 从外部实施这些政策绝非有效方法。 因此，要想巩固改革，希腊政府及其选民必须相信改革政策。 一国必须拥有其改革方案的所有权（ownership ） ， 这并非新教训。 IMF与乌克兰关系不稳定在最近一轮谈判之前很久就开始了。 2013年，IMF工作人员撰写了一份发人深省的报告，总结了IMF在乌克兰的经验。 从根本上说，他们的结论是政府不充分相信改革程序，改革方案就无从奏效。 报告认为，如果政府无力执行需要的调整或对调整不感兴趣，那么最佳办法是不实施改革就不给钱，就像现在对希腊做得那样。 不幸的是，这一方针不足以克服希腊的问题。 结构改革的条件常常会改变互相竞争的国内派系，结果有利有弊。 如果国内没有意愿维持改革，那么改革很快就会遭到破坏。 左翼思想一直认为结构改革方案十分可疑，IMF和世界银行的国际贷款人被新自由派市场原教旨主义绑架了。 这一批评不无道理，但用力过猛。 诚然，结构改革常常向弹性劳动力市场等等政策倾斜。 但不应该非黑即白地看待这些干预。 打破将年轻工人排除在外的二���劳动力市场（南欧有很多这样的情况，包括意大利和一定程度上的法国）与让解雇一切工人变得更容易是完全不同的两码事。 让退休金体系变得可持续并不意味着一定要减少退休金。 简化和公平化税收体系并不等同于提高一切税收。 最近，结构改革的反对者提出了更加奇怪的反对理由 — — 最值得关注的是政策利率处于零水平时通缩所造成的问题。 如果结构改革降低了所有工资和物价，那么克服短期总需求下降的确十分困难。 但类似的批评也适用于其他任何政策变化：如果设计不合理，必然不利于生产。 真相是欧洲要向前进就必须提高生产率。 希腊和其他失败援助方案的教训发人深省。 如果债务援助方案要求一国经济、社会和政治模式发生全面的变化，那么最好的行动方案可能是减记私人损失，而不是用公共资金覆盖私人损失。 在希腊的例子中，债权人的结构改革热情也许更应该引导向国内 — — 特别是改善金融监管。 绝大多数希腊人都希望留在欧盟。 在理想情形中，以改革为交换提供金融援助也许有助于那些希望转变为现代欧洲邦国的国家。 但考虑到希腊目前在做出必要改变从而实现这一目标方面所遇到的困难，也许应该彻底重新思考这一危机解决方案。 对于向一国提供更多贷款的方案，也许最好的办法是提供直接人道援助 — — 不管希腊是否完全留在欧元区。"

            "Why the Greek Deal Will Work LONDON – Now that Greek banks have reopened and the government has made scheduled payments to the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund, does Greece’s near-death experience mark the end of the euro crisis? The conventional answer is a clear no. According to most economists and political commentators, the latest Greek bailout was little more than an analgesic. It will dull the pain for a short period, but the euro’s deep-seated problems will metastasize, with a dismal prognosis for the single currency and perhaps even the European Union as a whole. But the conventional wisdom is likely to be proved wrong. The deal between Greece and the European authorities is actually a good one for both sides. Rather than marking the beginning of a new phase of the euro crisis, the agreement may be remembered as the culmination of a long series of political compromises that, by correcting some of the euro’s worst design flaws, created the conditions for a European economic recovery. To express guarded optimism about the Greek deal is not to condone the provocative arrogance of former Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis or the pointless vindictiveness of German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble. Neither is it to deny the economic criticism of the bailout provisions presented by progressives like Joseph Stiglitz and conservatives like Hans-Werner Sinn. The arguments against creating a European single currency and then allowing Greece to cheat its way into membership were valid back in the 1990s – and, in theory, they still are. But this does not mean that breaking up the euro would be desirable, or even tolerable. Joining the euro was certainly ruinous for Greece, but there is always “a great deal of ruin in a nation,” as Adam Smith remarked 250 years ago, when losing the American colonies seemed to threaten Britain with financial devastation. The great virtue of capitalism is that it adapts to ruinous conditions and even finds ways of turning them to advantage. The United States in the mid-nineteenth century was badly suited for a single currency and a single economic structure, as evidenced by the Civil War, which was provoked as much by single-currency tensions as by moral abhorrence to slavery. Italy would probably be better off today if Garibaldi had never launched unification. But once unification has happened, the pain of dismantling the political and economic settlement usually overwhelms the apparent gains from a break-up. This seems to be the case in Europe, as clear majorities of voters are saying in all eurozone countries, including Germany and Greece. Thus, the question was never whether the single currency would break up, but what political reversals, economic sacrifices, and legal subterfuges would occur to hold it together. The good news is that Europe now has some persuasive answers. Indeed, Europe has overcome what could be described as the “original sin” of the single-currency project: the Maastricht Treaty’s prohibition of “monetary financing” of government deficits by the ECB and the related ban on mutual support by national governments of one another’s debt burdens. In January, ECB President Mario Draghi effectively sidestepped both obstacles by launching a program of quantitative easing so enormous that it will finance the entire deficits of all eurozone governments (now including Greece) and mutualize a significant proportion of their outstanding bonds. Moreover, European governments have belatedly understood the most basic principle of public finance. Government debts never have to be repaid, provided they can be extended in a cooperative manner or bought up with newly created money, issued by a credible central bank. But for this to be possible, interest payments must always be made on time, and the sanctity of debt contracts must always take precedence over electoral promises regarding pensions, wages, and public spending. Now that Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras’s government has been forced to acknowledge the unqualified priority of debt servicing, and can now benefit from unlimited monetary support from the ECB, Greece should have little problem supporting its debt burden, which is no heavier than Japan’s or Italy’s. Finally, Germany, Spain, Italy, and several northern European countries required, for domestic political reasons, a ritual humiliation of radical Greek politicians and voters who openly defied EU institutions and austerity demands. Having achieved this, EU leaders have no further reason to impose austerity on Greece or strictly enforce the terms of the latest bailout. Instead, they have every incentive to demonstrate the success of their “tough love” policies by easing austerity to accelerate economic growth, not only in Greece but throughout the eurozone. This raises a key issue that the Tsipras government and many others misunderstood throughout the Greek crisis: the role of constructive hypocrisy in Europe’s political economy. Gaps between public statements and private intentions open up in all political systems, but these become huge in a complex multinational structure like the EU. On paper, the Greek bailout will impose a fiscal tightening, thereby aggravating the country’s economic slump. In practice, however, the budget targets will surely be allowed to slip, provided the government carries out its promises on privatization, labor markets, and pension reform. These structural reforms are much more important than fiscal targets, both in symbolic terms for the rest of Europe and for the Greek economy. Moreover, the extension of ECB monetary support to Greece will transform financial conditions: interest rates will plummet, banks will recapitalize, and private credit will gradually become available for the first time since 2010. If budget targets were strictly enforced by bailout monitors, which seems unlikely, this improvement in conditions for private borrowers could easily compensate for any modest tightening of fiscal policy. In short, the main conditions now seem to be in place for a sustainable recovery in Greece. Conventional wisdom among economists and investors has a long record of failing to spot major turning points; so the near-universal belief today that Greece faces permanent depression is no reason to despair.",
            "为何希腊协议会起作用 伦敦—希腊银行已经重新开门，希腊政府也按期偿付了欧洲央行和国际货币基金组织（IMF ） 。 那么，希腊差点死去的经验是否标志着欧元危机的结束？ 传统答案是言简意赅的“不 ” 。 根据大部分经济学家和政治评论家的观点，最新一轮希腊援助充其量只是止痛剂。 它能够暂时减少痛苦，但欧元的深层次问题将会转移，这个单一货币乃至整个欧盟的预后非常不乐观。 但传统智慧可能是错误的。 希腊和欧洲当局的协议实际上对于双方都是好事。 该协议绝非欧元危机新阶段开始的标志，它有可能作为一系列漫长的政治妥协的起点被人铭记，这一系列妥协纠正了欧元最糟糕的设计缺陷，为欧洲经济复苏创造了条件。 表示对希腊协议谨慎乐观并不是要饶恕前希腊财政部长瓦鲁法基斯（Yanis Varoufakis）目中无人的傲慢或德国总理朔伊布勒（Wolfgang Schäuble）毫无意义的恶意相逼。 这也不是要否认斯蒂格利茨（Joseph Stiglitz）等进步人士和辛恩（Hans-Werner Sinn）等保守人士对援助条款的经济学批评。 反对创造欧洲单一货币然后允许希腊作弊获得欧元区成员资格的批评可以在20世纪90年代很有道理 — — 理论上，它们至今仍然如此。 但这并不意味着应该让欧元区解体，甚至不意味着可以容忍欧元区解体。 加入欧元区显然给希腊造成了破坏，但亚当·斯密在250年前失去美国殖民地眼看着要给英国带来金融灾难时就指出 ， “ 一个国家永远有各种破坏 ” 。 资本主义的一大优点是它能适应破坏性条件甚至找到办法把它们转化为优势。 十九世纪中叶的美国十分不适合采取单一货币和单一经济结构，南北战争就是明证，单一货币紧张局势和对奴隶制到的痛恨都是战争爆发的原因。 如果加里波第没能统一意大利，说不定意大利会比今天更好。 但一旦统一事件发生了，废除政治和经济制度安排的痛苦常常会比分裂的直接好处更大。 欧洲似乎就是如此，所有欧元区国家，包括德国和希腊的绝对多数选民都这么认为。 因此，问题从来不是单一货币是否将打破，而是何种政治逆转、经济牺牲和法律借口能让单一货币得以维持。 好消息是欧洲现在已经有了一些有说服力的答案。 事实上，欧洲已经克服了可称之为单一货币工程“原罪”的东西：马斯特里赫特条约禁止欧洲央行给政府赤字“货币融资”以及对国家政府共同支持彼此债务负担的禁令。 1月，欧洲央行行长德拉吉事实上绕过了这两个障碍，实施了量化宽松方案，其规模之大足以为所有欧元区政府（现在也包括希腊）的全部赤字提供融资，并将它们未偿还债务的大部分共同化。 此外，欧洲政府终于认识到公共财政的最基本原则。 政府债务永远不必偿还，只要可以以合作的方式展期或用由可信央行发行的新创造的货币买断。 但要让这一幕发生，必须按时支付利息，并且债务契约的神圣性永远高于关于退休金、工资和公共支出的选举承诺。 如今，希腊总理齐普拉斯政府被迫承认了支付债务利息才是至高无上的当务之急，因此可以获得来自欧洲央行的无限量货币支持，因此，希腊支持其并不比日本或意大利更沉重的债务负担应该没有什么问题。 最后，德国、西班牙、意大利和一些北欧国家出于国内政治原因要求对公开违抗欧盟机构和紧缩要求的希腊政客和选民给予形式羞辱（ritual humiliation ） 。 实现了这一目的，欧盟领导人就没有进一步的理由对希腊施加紧缩或严格执行最新援助的条件。 相反，他们有很大的激励通过放松紧缩以加速经济增长（不仅仅是希腊，而是整个欧元区）来证明“严���的爱”的成功。 这就引出了一个齐普拉斯政府和其他人在整个希腊危机中误解的问题：假设性伪善在欧洲政治经济学中的作用。 公开言论和私下意图之间的差异在所有政治制度中都存在，但像欧盟这样的复杂多边结构中特别巨大。 表面上，希腊援助将带来财政紧缩，从而加剧希腊经济衰退。 但在实际中，预算目标必然有商量余地，只要政府兑现其在私有化、劳动力市场和退休金改革方面的承诺。 这些结构改革比财政目标重要得多，不管是对欧洲其他国家的象征意义还是对希腊经济而言。 此外，延长欧洲央行对希腊的货币支持将转变金融环境：利率将下降，银行将资本重组，私人信用将逐渐可得（这是2010年以来没有发生过的事 ） 。 如果援助监督者严格执行预算目标 — — 这看起来不太可能 — — 这一私人借款人条件的改善轻而易举就能补偿任何财政政策的略微收紧。 简言之，目前希腊可持续复苏的主要条件看起来已经具备。 经济学家和投资者的传统智慧常常无法辨认重要转折点；因此，完全不必担心当下几乎人人都持有的观点：希腊面临持久萧条。"

            "Why the Plastic Crisis Matters MANILA – Plastics have become a hot topic. News stories about plastic on beaches and in the oceans abound, and policymakers have begun to respond with bans or limitations on plastic bags and single-use plastic items. But the plastics industry is fighting back, arguing that plastics are indispensable, and that the real problem is littering consumers and poor waste-management systems. According to the industry’s talking points, bedridden hospital patients and the elderly depend on bendy straws, and phasing out shrink-wrap on vegetables will lead to a food-spoilage disaster. No one doubts that waste management in much of the developing world – and even in many richer countries – needs to be improved. Governments urgently need to invest in better waste-collection and processing systems. But the rich world also must stop exporting its worthless plastic waste to poor countries for so-called “recycling.” All too often, the trash that Europeans and Americans sort and separate into different bins ends up in containers bound for Southeast Asia, to be picked up by underpaid workers in hazardous conditions. Ultimately, much of it ends up in dumpsites or waterways anyway. More to the point, the flood of plastic into our natural systems is linked directly to the other forces that are destroying our environment, decimating biodiversity, fueling climate change, and depleting natural resources. That is the main finding of the Plastic Atlas, recently published by the Heinrich Böll Foundation and the Break Free From Plastic Movement. As the Atlas – a compendium of facts, figures, and background information on the synthetic polymers that have become an integral part of our lives over the last 70 years – makes clear, the plastics industry has been selling us a false narrative. The plastics crisis is much more than a waste-management problem. The real story starts as soon as oil and gas are extracted from the ground, and continues long after plastic waste enters the ocean and other ecosystems. Not only is plastic production a major source of greenhouse-gas emissions; it also releases a wide range of other chemicals into the environment, many of which end up in our lungs and stomachs. Thus, while efforts to tackle waste are important, they must not distract attention from the main problem: the world is producing far too much plastic in the first place. Between 1950 and 2017, around 9.2 billion tons of plastic were produced globally, which is equivalent to more than one ton per living person today. Worse, over half of that plastic has been churned out since 2000, and the rate of production continues to accelerate, with no slowdown in sight. According to recent estimates, plastic production and incineration could emit 56 billion tons of carbon dioxide equivalent by 2050, accounting for 10-13% of the total carbon budget we can “spend” by mid-century under current emissions-reduction commitments. By the end of the century, plastic-related emissions could amount to half the total carbon budget. The climate crisis and the plastics crisis are two sides of the same coin. To keep global warming within an acceptable range, we absolutely must reduce the amount of plastic we produce, consume, and discard. And no, this is not a problem that we can recycle our way out of. Less than 10% of all plastics ever produced have been recycled. In the case of the United States, under 10% of plastic waste is recycled; the rest is incinerated or dumped in landfills. While better waste-management and more recycling are both imperative, the only real, lasting solution is to produce less plastic in the first place. We must start by cutting down on the plastic packaging that accounts for 40% of all plastic waste. The first step is to phase out single-use items such as plastic grocery and garbage bags, cutlery, and, yes, those wonderful bendy straws. Humankind must find ways to get by without laying waste to the planet. That means reducing, in absolute terms, the amount of material we use throughout the economy. It also means halting the development of petrochemical facilities that produce plastics and other highly polluting materials. More broadly, we must force manufacturers to change their distribution and delivery systems towards refillable and reusable systems, and to take responsibility for the damage their products cause. Some of these measures are already being adopted. In Asia, entire cities are moving toward zero-waste solutions through decentralized community-led and centered initiatives, bans on single-use plastics, and lobbying against waste incineration. Many of the solutions remain to be discovered and developed; but Asia is proving to be the engine of change. The movement for zero waste is growing at the global level. It is naming and shaming the corporations that churn out the most plastic. And it is pushing governments to ban fracking and drilling, mandate reduced production of plastic, and champion reuse and refill solutions. If there is one thing that can stop the flood of plastic, it is greater accountability. And accountability, in turn, relies on good data and information. We must expose and publicize the truth about plastic, and counter the misleading narratives propagated by the plastics industry. The Plastic Atlas represents an opportunity to turn the page.",
            "为何塑料危机很重要 马尼拉—塑料已成为一个热门话题。 关于海岸和海洋中的塑料的报道不绝于耳，决策者也开始用禁令和限制令来应对塑料袋和一次性塑料用品问题。 但塑料行业正在反击，说塑料不可或缺，而真正的问题是消费者乱扔和废物管理体系不善。 根据塑料业的论点，卧床不起的住院病患老人需要依靠弯杆吸管，而取消热缩包装蔬菜将导致食物质变的灾难。 毫无疑问，在大部分发展中国家 — — 甚至许多发达国家 — — 废物管理有待改善。 政府急需投资于更好的废物收集和处理系统。 但发达世界还必须停止向穷国以所谓的“循环利用”为名输出没有价值的塑料废品。 欧洲人和美国人分类丢弃在不同垃圾桶中的垃圾，最终被装上集装箱晕倒了东南亚，由薪水可怜的工人在有毒有害的工作环境中进行分拣。 最终，大部分垃圾的归宿是填埋场和水路。 更重要的是，涌入自然系统的塑料与摧毁环境、破坏生物多样性、助长气候变化和耗尽自然资源的其他力量直接相关。 这便是最近发布的、海因里希·玻尔基金会（Heinrich Böll）和与塑料决裂运动（Break Free From Plastic Movement）联俄和发布的《塑料阿特拉斯 》 （ Plastic Atlas）的主要发现。 《塑料阿特拉斯》汇总了关于合成高分子材料的事实、数据和背景信息，在过去70年里，这种材料已成为我们生活的一部分。 报告清楚地表明，塑料业一直在向我们兜售错误的叙事。 塑料危机早已不仅仅是废物管理问题。 真正的故事在石油和天然气从地底下采掘出来时便已经开始，并将一直持续到塑料废物进入海洋和其他生态系统之后许久。 塑料生产不仅时温室气体排放的主要源头，还向环境中释放了各种其他化学物质，其中许多最后都进入了我们的肺部和胃部。 因此，处理废物的措施固然重要，但绝不能因为它们而减少了对主要问题的关注：世界在一开始生产了过多的塑料。 1950-2017年，全球生产了大约92亿吨塑料，相当于今天每个人生产一吨。 更糟糕的是，这些塑料中有一大半为2000年后生产，而生产速度还在不断加快，看不到减速迹象。 据最新估计，到2050年，塑料生产和焚化将排放560吨二氧化碳当量，占到世纪中叶根据当前减排承诺计算的可“支出”总碳预算的10-13 % 。 到世纪末，塑料相关排放浆站总碳预算的一半。 气候危机和塑料危机时一个硬币的两面。 为将全球变暖幅度控制在可接受范围内，我们绝对必须降低我们所生产、消费和废弃的塑料数量。 此外，这绝非一个可以用循环利用解决的问题。 在我们生产出来的所有塑料中，只有不到10%得到了循环利用。 在美国，不到10%的塑料被循环利用；其余都被焚化或填埋了。 改善废物管理和加大循环利用力度都当务之急，但唯一真正持续的方案是从一开始减少塑料产量。 我们首先必须减少塑料保障，这占了40%的塑料废物。 第一步是要逐步杜绝塑料购物袋和垃圾袋、餐具，以及，是的，棒极了的弯杆吸管等一次性物品。 人类必须找到办法不再给地球增加废物。 这意味着在绝对数量上减少经济中所用的物质。 这也意味着停止开发生产塑料盒其他高污染物质的石化设施。 更广泛地说，我们必须强制制造商改变分销和送货系统，转向可二次封装和二次使用的系统，并为它们的产品所造成的伤害承担责任。 一些措施已经得到了实施。 在亚洲，整座城市都在通过分散化的社区领导的集中项目、一次性塑料用品禁令，以及反废物焚化游说，转向零废物方案。 许多方案仍有待发现和实施；但亚洲正在成为变化的推动力。 转向零废物的运动也在全球范围内茁壮成长。 生产最多塑料的公司被点名羞辱。 政府也在被推动禁止致裂法和钻井，强制要求降低塑料产量，以及倡导二次使用和二次封装方案。 如果说有什么办法能够阻止塑料泛滥的话，那就是加强问责。 问责反过来又依靠良好的数据和信息。 我们必须曝光和公布关于塑料的真相，反击塑料行业所宣传的误导性叙事。 《塑料阿特拉斯》便是一次翻页的机会。"

            "Money-Market Resistance CAMBRIDGE – The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently rejected proposed rules aimed at making money-market funds safer in a financial crisis – a rejection that has caused consternation among observers and other regulators. Given the risks that money market funds can pose to the global financial system, as shown by their destabilizing role in the 2008 financial crisis, it is not hard to see why they are worried. Money-market funds take excess cash from investors and use it to purchase short-term IOUs from businesses, banks, and other financial institutions. They mimic bank accounts by allowing investors to write checks and promise that their investment’s value will not fall. In 2012, American “prime” money-market funds, which buy bank and corporate debt, were worth nearly $1.5 trillion. The money flowing through these funds went to many of the world’s largest banks, including not just the obvious US suspects (JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America, and Citi), but also major European and Japanese banks such as Barclays, Deutsche Bank, Bank of Tokyo, Sumitomo, Credit Suisse, and ING. These six international banks alone accounted for nearly 20% of the prime money-market funds’ value. Many readers know how money-market funds work: An investor buys a $1.00 share from the XYZ fund, which keeps each share’s value at a constant $1.00, allowing the investor to believe that the money – invested in a pool of safe, secure, but not always government-guaranteed assets – is on deposit. Even if the asset pool declines in value, the fund’s managers keep the value of each share at $1.00 by rounding upward the fund’s real value. If the fund’s losses are big enough that rounding off still leaves it short of a stable $1.00 value, the fund “breaks the buck.” That happened when Lehman Brothers failed in September 2008. The Reserve Fund, a well-established money-market fund with too many unpaid IOUs from Lehman, could not keep its value steady. It broke the buck. All money-market funds then became suspect, and many investors fled – withdrawing one-third of a trillion dollars in a single week. Since much of the money-market funds’ assets are IOUs from the world’s biggest banks, the withdrawals weakened the already-shaky global banking system. The Federal Reserve, seeking to stem the growing panic and stabilize the American and international banking system, promptly guaranteed the value of all money-market funds. The proposals that the SEC rejected were aimed at making money-market funds more robust by requiring that each fund maintain capital reserves or let its value “float” – and not be rounded up – to reflect its true, underlying risk. The proposal would also have required that money-market funds hold back a fraction of some redemptions, thereby making investors take some risk that funds might not have complete transactional liquidity if their investments weakened. A majority of the commissioners turned down the proposals after substantial lobbying from the mutual-fund industry. If money-market funds had to maintain capital reserves, industry representatives argued, yields to investors would decline and the industry’s profits would suffer. And, if retail investors saw their money-market funds’ values declining from the amount that they had invested, and if they knew that they could not get all of their money back immediately, the funds would become less attractive. Investors might choose other places for their excess cash, like banks. Banks are obliged to hold reserves, maintain capital, and pay deposit insurance to ensure that they can honor their deposits. The mutual-fund industry, one can assume, feared that the SEC’s rules would induce customers to redirect much of their cash directly into banks. As a result of the SEC’s inaction, money-market funds will continue to operate outside the scope of bank-style rules on capital and reserves, even though investors treat them like bank accounts. Unlike banks, though, they do not pay the government to insure their investors. But the 2008 financial crisis showed that, when push comes to shove, the government will backstop money-market funds nonetheless. The rejected proposals are thus good policy: money-market funds should be made safer – via capital requirements and liquidity restrictions – because they already receive a de facto government guarantee. Their steady value makes them appear safer to investors than they are to the world’s financial system. The SEC’s rejection of the proposed rules demonstrates the power of concerted lobbying – and that concentrated interests often trump diffuse benefits. Typically, an interest group lobbies Congress, blandishing persuasive arguments, campaign contributions, and other support; often enough members – or enough key members – come to see the merit of the group’s point of view (or at least vote as if they do). Meanwhile, ordinary citizens do not notice unless the issue receives significant media attention. Often no one lobbies the other side of the issue. One might think that banks would counter-balance the mutual-fund industry’s lobbying efforts, because the likely effect of forcing money-market funds to pay for more of their systemic costs would be to expand funds flowing directly to banks. But inflows through money-market funds are not so bad for banks, which get the cash without having to set aside reserves or pay for deposit insurance. Some banks may even prefer these flows to direct deposits. So the mutual-fund industry had the regulators all to itself. Its lobbyists told the SEC commissioners that current rules already did everything possible to ensure safety; that retail investors want money-market funds’ steady value; that change would hurt all investors; and that the recent Dodd-Frank financial-reform legislation disrupts regulators’ ability to bail out money-market funds next time. Other regulators were watching, as were academics and journalists – and some regulators may now feel compelled to take over the money-market safety rules from the SEC or push the SEC back into action. With no one having a direct financial interest in the outcome pressing an alternative view, the SEC’s initial decision was as predictable as it was bad.",
            "货币市场基金的抵抗 发自剑桥 — — 美国证券交易委员会最近否决了一系列旨在令货币市场基金在金融危机中更加安全的提案，令众多观察员和其他监管者大惊失色。 而考虑到货币市场基金可能为全球金融系统带来的风险 — — 正如其在2008年所扮演的不稳定角色—自然也不难明白人们为何如此忧虑。 货币市场基金从投资者处吸收多余的资金来从企业，银行和其他金融机构购买短期金融要求权（IOU ） 。 他们通过允许投资者写支票来模仿银行账户，并承诺后者的投资价值不会下跌。 在2012年，购买银行和企业债券的美国“主要”货币市场基金规模达1.5万亿美元。 通过这些基金的资金流通往全球许多大型银行，不仅包括常说的那几个美国巨头（摩根大通，美洲银行和花旗银行 ） ， 还有英格兰银行、德意志银行、东京银行，住友银行，瑞士瑞信银行和荷兰ING银行等欧日大型银行。 单单后面这六家国际银行就占了主要货币市场基金总市值的近20 % 。 许多读者知道货币市场基金如何运作：一个投资者从某基金买了价值1美元的份额，而基金则一直保持每个份额都值1美元，令投资者相信自己的钱 — — 投资在一揽子安全，可靠但不常有政府担保的资产上 — — 是存款。 即便这个资产组合的价值下跌，基金经理也会通过将基金实际价值凑整的方式来将每份价值维持在1美元。 如果基金的损失使其即便凑整也无法维持稳定的1美元价值，基金就“跌破面值”了。 这种情况在2008年9月雷曼兄弟破产时就出现了。 “储备基金”这家持有过多未支付雷曼兄弟金融要求权的老牌货币市场无法维持自身价值稳定，出现了跌破面值的状况。 所以货币市场基金都因此遭到了质疑，许多投资者闻风撤资 — — 仅仅一个星期内就赎回了3000多亿美元。 由于大多数货币市场基金的资产都是那些来自各大银行的金融要求权，赎回行动削弱了本已摇摇欲坠的全球银行系统。 为了遏制恐慌的蔓延并稳定美国和国际银行系统，美联储则迅速为所有货币市场资金的价值做了担保。 而美国证券交易委员会所否决的几个提案正是为了让货币市场基金更加稳固，要求每个基金保持资本储备或者任其“浮动 ” — —而不是凑整 — — 来体现真实和潜在的风险。 提案同时也要求货币市场基金拒绝某些赎回行动中的一部分交易，从而令投资者们承担更多的风险 — — 如果他们的投资受损的话基金或许不会有完全的交易流动性。 在共有基金行业的有力游说下，委员会的大多数委员否决了这些提案。 那些行业的代理人认为，如果货币市场基金需要保持资本储本金的话，投资者的收益和行业的利润都将受损。 同时如果零售投资者发现原本投资的货币市场基金价值出现了下跌，如果他们知道自己无法迅速把自己的钱赎回来，那么这些基金的吸引力就会下降。 投资者会选择其他地方来配置自己的多余现金，比如银行。 银行有义务去持有储备金，维持资本，并支付储蓄保险以确保能为这些储蓄负责。 因此可以推测，共同基金行业害怕证券交易委员会的监管规则会令消费者将大部分现金转入银行。 即便投资者依然将其当作银行账户般看待，但由于证券交易委员会的不做为，货币市场基金将继续在银行式的资本和储备规则之外运作。 跟银行不同的是，他们并不会像政府付钱来为投资者担保。 但2008年的金融危机显示，当情况危急时，政府依然会为货币市场基金撑腰。 因此被否决的提案都是些好政策：货币市场基金应该变得更加安全 — — 通过对资本的要求以及流动性限制 — — 因为他们已经获得了一个事实上的政府担保。 它们的稳定价值使它们看上去对投资者显得更安全 — — 对全球金融系统就难说了。 证券交易委员会的否决行动显示出协商一致的游说行动 — — 以及集中的利益往往会胜过分散的利益。 通常来说，一个利益集团游说国会，组织有说服力的论据，发起筹款以及其他支持；往往有足够的议员 — — 或者足够的核心议员 — — 会看到该集团观点的可取之处（���至少看似明白地投下一票 ） 。 与此同时，普通市民直到情况受到媒体极大关注时才注意到这些事情。 往往也没有人去游说并陈述事情的另外一面。 有人或许会认为银行会抵消共同基金行业的游说努力，因为迫使货币市场基金支付更多系统成本可能会扩大直接流入银行的资金流。 但以货币市场基金形式流入的资金对于银行来说其实并不太坏，因为后者无须为这些现金进行资本储备或者支付存款保险。 一些银行甚至更喜欢这类现金流而非直接存款。 因此共同基金行业令监管者完全倒向了他们这边。 其游说者告诉一众证券交易委员会委员说没有比当前法规在确保资金安全方面更完善的了；说零售投资者想要货币市场基金的稳定价值；说改革会伤害所有投资者；说最近通过的Dodd-Frank金融改革立法削弱了监管者下次援助货币市场基金的能力。 和学者和记者一样，其他监管者都在旁观这一切 — — 有些监管者可能现在会觉得必须去从证券交易委员会处接管货币市场安全法规或者促使委员会有所作为。 由于没有人在推动另一个观点方面拥有直接的金融利益，委员会最初的决定也就变得毫无悬念，正如我们知道这个决定必将很糟糕那样。"

            "Transatlantic Free Trade? MADRID – This month, the United States National Intelligence Council released a sobering report entitled Global Trends 2030: Alternative Worlds. Most important, according to the authors, if current trends continue, Asia could soon surpass North America and Europe in global power. It will have a higher GDP, larger population, higher military spending, and more technological investment. In this geopolitical context, Europe and the US need each other more than ever, making greater transatlantic cooperation crucial. This seems to be the approach that inspired outgoing US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s recent speech at the Brookings Institution on US-European relations. Given the shift in global power and the prospect of US energy self-sufficiency as domestic hydrocarbon output booms, America is trying to adapt its foreign policy to the new multi-polar international order. And, although Asia is now America’s strategic priority, Europe is still the partner with which Americans have the most in common. “I want to be clear,” Clinton noted. “Our reorientation toward Asia is not a withdrawal from Europe.” The US, according to Clinton, hopes that Europe will follow suit, so that Asia is seen not only as a market, but also as a focus of common strategic action. But, beyond that, as the US and Europe seek to ensure their global roles, cooperation between them is more important than ever. So now is the time for a bold initiative: the launch of a US-European Union free-trade agreement. Clinton has already hinted at America’s readiness for this, mentioning the possibility of negotiating a complete agreement that would increase trade and stimulate growth on both sides of the Atlantic. The journalist David Ignatius even dared to give it a name in a recent article in The Washington Post: TAFTA (Transatlantic Free-Trade Agreement). Edward Luce, writing in the Financial Times, preferred “Transatlantic Partnership.” The US and the EU (taken as a whole) are not only the world’s two largest economies and typically the largest commercial partners for other major economies; they also maintain the world’s largest bilateral trade relationship. American investment in Europe is three times higher than it is in Asia. European investment in the US is eight times larger than its investments in China and India combined. So transatlantic trade is crucial for both economies, particularly for job creation. Indeed, it is estimated that one-third of all bilateral US-EU trade consists of internal transfers by companies that operate in both markets. Although US and EU tariffs on each other’s marketed manufactured goods are already low (below 3%, on average), a free-trade agreement would be enormously beneficial in promoting further investment, thereby boosting economic growth and creating more jobs. Such an agreement could include trade in goods, services, financial instruments, and agriculture, and would necessitate greater compatibility of European and American regulations and legal norms, implying substantial savings. Moreover, the effects of such an agreement would be felt far beyond the US and Europe. For example, both have already signed free-trade treaties with various Latin American countries, implying the creation of a geographically enormous free-trade area, which should boost economic resilience in the face of global crisis. Indeed, regional free-trade agreements are gaining momentum worldwide. The Trans-Pacific Partnership, a free-trade agreement spearheaded by the US, is set to be a game-changer in the Asia-Pacific region, with decisive advances this year putting it on course to be concluded in 2015. Potential signatories include the US, Australia, Malaysia, Vietnam, Singapore, New Zealand, Chile, Peru, Brunei, Canada, Mexico, and perhaps Japan and South Korea. The result will be trade liberalization in an area that produces 40% of global GDP. Isn’t it time to consider something similar for Europe and the US? The EU, now confronting a wave of populism and Euro-skepticism, could revive its sense of purpose by committing itself to closer transatlantic cooperation and coordination on trade, to be carried out by the European Commission. Such a project has worked before in bringing Europe together; it can do so again. The most precious asset today is confidence, and the mere fact of launching negotiations would generate it in abundance. Protectionism is no solution to the crisis, whereas a transatlantic free-trade agreement would favor multilateralism and openness. In this sense, it is important to stress the work of the World Trade Organization, the best multilateral forum that the world has for resolving trade disputes. Signing a transatlantic trade treaty would be irrefutable proof that the political case for open trade can be made – and won. The only way to achieve this is through the clear commitment of political leaders on both sides of the Atlantic, together with private-sector involvement, which is fundamental to sustaining urgently needed economic growth. But let’s not wait: faced with predictions of the West’s relative decline, the US and the EU must commit themselves to more union, more cooperation, and more prosperity. Today, that means a transatlantic free-trade agreement.",
            "跨大西洋自由贸易？ 马德里—本月，美国国家情报委员会公布了一份不容乐观的报告 ： 《 全球趋势2030：不一样的世界 》 （ Global Trends 2030: Alternative Worlds ） 。 作者所指出的最重要的一点是，如果当前趋势继续下去，亚洲将很快超过北美和欧洲成为全球一极。 亚洲将拥有更高的GDP、更多的人口、更大的军事支出和更多的技术投资。 在这样的地缘政治环境下，欧洲和美国比从前更加需要彼此，跨大西洋合作比以前更加重要。 这似乎也是即将离任的美国国务卿希拉里·克林顿在布鲁克林研究所美欧关系演讲的主旨。 全球实力正在发生变迁，美国也因国内碳氢化合物产量增加而走向能源自给，在这样的背景下，美国将调整外交政策，以适应新的多极国际秩序。 此外，尽管亚洲现在是美国的战略重点，但欧洲仍是和美国最有共同语言的伙伴。 “我要澄清 ， ” 克林顿指出 ， “ 我们的亚洲导向并不意味着从欧洲撤出 。 ” 按克林顿的说法，美国希望欧洲可以紧随其后，这样一来亚洲将不再仅仅是一个市场，而同时也是共同战略行动的焦点。 但是，除此之外，在美国和欧洲都在寻求确保全球地位时，它们之间的合作前所未有地重要。 因此，现在正是果断行动的良机：推出美欧联盟（US-European Union）自由贸易协定。 克林顿暗示美国已为此做好准备，提及了进行能够增进大西洋两岸贸易、刺激大西洋两岸经济的完整协定谈判。 记者伊格内修斯（David Ignatius）甚至在《华盛顿邮报》的最新文章中给它起了个名字：TAFTA（跨大西洋自由贸易协定 ） 。 《金融时报》的卢斯（Edward Luce）则更喜欢“跨大西洋伙伴关系”这个名字。 美国和欧盟（作为一个整体）不但是世界第一和第二大经济体、其他主要经济体通常的最大商业伙伴；它们还是世界规模最大的双边贸易的双方。 美国在欧洲的投资比在亚洲高三倍。 欧洲在美国的投资比在中国和印度的总和还高八倍。 因此跨大西洋贸易对双方都很关键，特别是在就业创造方面。 事实上，据估计，美国-欧盟双边贸易总额的三分之一是在双方都有经营活动的公司的内部转移。 尽管美国和欧盟对彼此的制造品关税已经很低（平均不到3 % ） ，但自由贸易协定仍能大大有利于后续投资，从而提振经济增长、创造就业。 这样一个协定可以包括商品、服务、金融工具和农业方面的贸易，也将成为增加欧洲和美国监管和法律规范兼容性的必要条件，这意味着省下大笔资金。 此外，这样一个协定的影响范围将远超美国和欧洲。 比如，美国和欧洲均已和许多拉丁美洲国家签订了自由贸易条约，这意味着可以建立一个地理范围极广的自由贸易区，从而增强抵御全球危机的韧性。 事实上，地区自由贸易协定正在全世界高歌猛进。 美国牵头的自由贸易协定跨太平洋合作伙伴关系改变亚太地区的格局，该协定在今年取得了决定性进步，计划将于2015年完成。 潜在签署方包括美国、澳大���亚、马来西亚、越南、新加坡、新西兰、智利、秘鲁、文莱、加拿大、墨西哥，可能还有日本和韩国。 其结果将是一个站全球GDP份额40%的自由贸易区。 现在难道不是考虑在欧洲和美国之间实行类似安排的良机吗？ 眼下，欧盟正面对着欧元怀疑派的民粹主义风潮，它可以通过更深地投入跨大西洋贸易合作和协作（将由欧盟委员会负责实施）重新燃起使命感。 类似的工程曾经在团结欧洲方面祈祷过重要作用；现在可以依样画葫芦。 眼下，信心比黄金更重要，而进行谈判这一事实变已足够产生足够的信心。 保护主义绝不是危机的解决方案，而跨大西洋自由贸易协定有利于多边主义和开放。 从这个角度看，促进世贸组织的工作十分重要，因为这是世界所拥有的解决贸易纠纷的最好论坛。 毫无疑问，签署跨大西洋贸易条约能够证明，开放贸易的政治条件可以创造并成功。 达到这一目标的唯一办法是大西洋两岸政治领袖的明确承诺，并辅之以私人部门参与，后者是维持急需的经济增长的关键。 但所谓时不我待，在西方相对衰落的预言声中，美国和欧盟应该致力于更多的联合，更多的合作和更大的繁荣。 如今，这就意味着跨大西洋自由贸易协定。"

            "Financial Reform’s Breakthrough Year ZANZIBAR – Here’s an odd prediction for the coming year: 2013 will be a watershed for financial reform. True, while the global financial crisis erupted more than four years ago, and the Dodd-Frank financial reforms were adopted in the United States back in 2010, not much has changed about how Wall Street operates – except that the large firms have become bigger and more powerful. Yet there are reasons to expect real progress in the new year. The US Federal Reserve is finally shifting its thinking. In a series of major speeches this fall, Governor Dan Tarullo made the case that the problem of “too big to fail” financial institutions remains with us. We need to take additional measures to reduce the level of systemic risk – including limiting the size of our largest banks. News reports indicate that the Fed has already started saying no to some bank mergers. At the same time, the US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has become a bastion of sensible thinking on financial-sector issues. In part, this is because the FDIC is responsible for cleaning up the mess when financial-sector firms fail, so its senior officials have a strong incentive to protect its insurance fund by preventing risks from getting out of control. The FDIC is showing intellectual leadership as well as organizational capabilities – Vice Chairman Tom Hoenig’s speeches are a must-read. Wall Street is pushing back, of course. But the rolling series of scandals surrounding global megabanks makes it difficult for anyone to keep a straight face when executives insist that our largest banks must maintain their current scale and scope. Do we need HSBC to facilitate global money laundering? Do we need Barclays and UBS to manipulate Libor (a key benchmark for interest rates around the world)? Do we need still more losses at poorly run trading operations for JP Morgan Chase? The pro-bank lobby groups are positioning themselves to argue that the new resolution powers under Dodd-Frank have ended the too-big-to-fail problem, and we can expect a public-relations drive in this direction early in the new year. But the consensus view at the most recent meeting of the FDIC’s Systemic Resolution Advisory Committee (of which I am a member) was that this claim should not be taken seriously. Under Dodd-Frank, it is arguably easier for the FDIC to handle the failure of a single large financial institution than it was in pre-Dodd-Frank days. But what if two or three or seven firms are all in trouble at the same time? The answer, as former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker implied at the meeting, is that we would be right back where we started – in the panic and frozen credit markets that followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008. Indeed, the idea that substantial shocks could soon hit the US financial system is not far-fetched. The European debt crisis, for example, remains far from being resolved. A significant sovereign-debt restructuring there would bring down European banks and potentially damage US banks – as well as financial institutions around the world. Meanwhile, the continuing problems at European banks are a stark reminder that operating highly leveraged, thinly capitalized firms is incredibly risky. And the regulatory failures in Europe – consider the German Landesbanks, for example – will become only more obvious in the coming months. Creating a common supervisory authority will mean nothing unless it can clean up the mess created by the existing supervisors. And that cleanup will expose more of the rot in banks’ current operations. The need for banks to finance themselves with more equity and relatively less debt will be the focus of one of the main publishing events in economics in 2013. Anat Admati and Martin Hellwig’s The Bankers’ New Clothes: What’s Wrong with Banking and What to Do About it? will appear officially in March, but advance copies are already being closely read in leading central banks. Bankers everywhere will rush to read it before their regulators do. The road to the ongoing financial and economic crisis was built on a foundation of intellectual capture: not only regulators, but academics, too, became captivated by modern finance and its methods. Admati and Hellwig are at the vanguard of the counterrevolution, challenging the great myths of banking head-on. Do we need financial institutions to be so highly leveraged (that is, carrying so much debt relative to equity)? No, they argue. If banks of all kinds were financed with more equity, they would have stronger buffers to absorb losses. Both the equity and the debt issued by well-capitalized banks would be safer – and therefore cheaper. Bankers want to be so highly leveraged for a simple reason: implicit government guarantees mean that they get the upside when things go well, while the downside is someone else’s problem. Contrary to bankers’ claims, this is not a good arrangement for society. Admati and Hellwig are confronting the bankers and their allies in no uncertain terms, grounding their argument in deep financial thinking, yet writing for a broad audience. Whatever else happens in 2013, we can be sure that they will not win the Goldman Sachs Business Book of the Year award.",
            "金融改革的突破之年 桑给巴尔—新一年有老预言：2013年将是金融改革的分水岭之年。 诚然，尽管全球金融危机爆发已逾四年，美国的多德-弗兰克金融改革也在2010年便被通过，但华尔街的运作方式并没有什么变化 — — 除了大公司变得更大、更有权势之外。 但仍有不少理由期待新的一年中会有真正的进步。 美联储终于开始转变思维了。 在今年秋天的一系列重要演讲中，美联储理事塔鲁罗（Dan Tarullo）明确指出，金融机构“太大而不能倒”的问题仍然没有消除。 我们需要动用更多的措施降低系统性风险 — — 包括限制最大银行的规模。 新报告表明，美联储已经开始对一些银行并购说不。 与此同时，美国联邦存款保险公司（FDIC）已成为理智思考金融部门问题的重要堡垒。 这部分是因为FDIC需要在金融部门企业倒闭时收拾残局，因此其高级官员有强烈的激励通过防止风险失控保护保险资金。 FDIC不但起到了观念领袖作用，也是组织能力的先锋 — — 其副主席霍尼格（Tom Hoenig）的演讲不容错过。 当然，华尔街在卷土重来。 但全球银行巨头没完没了的丑闻让所有人都不会对银行高管所声称的大银行必须维持现有规模的论调买账。 我们需要汇丰帮助在全世界洗钱吗？ 我们希望巴克莱和瑞银操纵Libor（世界关键性基准利率之一）吗？ 我们需要JP摩根大通的不慎交易给我们带来更大损失吗？ 支持银行的游说集团辩称新多德-弗兰克法案下的解决方案已经终结了太大而不能倒问题，明年年初，我们可以期待公共关系推动这一方向的进步。 但FDIC系统性解决方案咨询委员会（Systemic Resolution Advisory Committee，我也是委员之一）最新的一致意见是对这一论断不能妄加信任。 在多德-弗兰克法案下，FDIC处理一家大金融机构的难度确实比多德-弗兰克法案出台前容易了一些。 但如果两家、三家甚至所有金融企业同时陷入麻烦呢？ 前美联储主席沃克尔在会议中指出，答案在于我们应该回到起点 — — 2008年9月雷曼兄弟倒闭所引起的恐慌和信用市场冻结。 事实上，严重冲击很快会袭向美国金融体系的观点绝非杞人忧天。 比如，欧洲债务危机就远远没有得到解决。 欧洲的大规模主权债务重组将导致欧洲银行的倒闭，并可能危害美国银行以及全世界的金融机构。 与此同时，欧洲银行问题的持续提醒我们，高杠杆、低资本经营的公司风险极高。 而欧洲的监管无能 — — 德国Landesbanks就是明证 — — 在未来几个月中将进一步显现。 成立共同监督当局是毫无意义的，除非它能够收拾好现任监督者留下的残局。 而收拾残局将会把更多欧洲银行的经营问题暴露出来。 银行需要更多地依靠股权融资、相对减少债务为自己筹集资金，这将使2013年经济读物的主要关注点之一。 阿德马蒂（Anat Admati）和赫尔维格（Martin Hellwig）的《银行家的新衣：银行犯了什么错以及怎样纠正错误？ 》 （ The Bankers’ New Clothes: What’s Wrong with Banking and What to Do About it ? ） 将在3月正式面世，但抢鲜版已经开始在主要央行中间流传。 各国银行家都会抢在监管者之前阅读这本书。 迈向持续金融和经济之路建立在思想禁锢的基础上：不仅仅是监管者，学术界也越来越受制于现代金融学及其方法的支配。 阿德马蒂和赫尔维格是反革命先锋，挑战了“银行向前冲”的大神话。 我们需要金融机构杠杆如此职高吗（也就是说，相对于股本债务太多 ） ？ 他们的回答是否定的。 如果各种各样的银行都更多地通过股权方式融资，它们将拥有更大的损失吸收缓冲。 资本状况较好的银行所发行的股票和债券将更安全 — — 因此成本更低。 银行家希望杠杆率如此之高，原因很简单：隐性政府担保意味着他们可以在好光景时获利，而坏光景是其他人的问题。 与银行家的言论相反，这绝不是好的社会安排。 阿德马蒂和赫尔维格以斩钉截铁的方式站在了银行界及其盟军的对立面，他们的论点具有深层金融思想根基，尽管他们的书是写给大众看的。 不论2013年发生什么事情，我们可以确定的是，这本书得不到高盛年度商业书籍奖。"

            "In Defense of Non-Visionaries OXFORD – Many of the recent tributes for Margaret Thatcher following her death celebrated her as a “transformational” leader who brought about great changes. There were frequent references to her equally transformational American counterpart, Ronald Reagan. But a more interesting comparison is with her other presidential contemporary, George H. W. Bush. Though often dismissed as a mere “transactional” manager, Bush had one of the best foreign-policy records of the past half-century. His administration managed the end of the Cold War, the dismantlement of the Soviet Union, and the unification of Germany within NATO – all without violence. At the same time, he led a broad United Nations-backed coalition that repelled Saddam Hussein’s aggression against Kuwait. Had he dropped any of the balls he was juggling, today’s world would be much worse. Although he presided over a major global transformation, Bush, by his own account, did not have transformational objectives. On the unification of Germany, he resisted the advice of Thatcher and others, apparently out of a sense of fairness and responsiveness to his friend, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl. In October 1989, Bush responded to a call from Kohl by publicly stating that he did not “share the concern that some European countries have about a reunified Germany.” At the same time, he was careful to let Kohl and others take the lead. When the Berlin Wall was opened a month later, partly owing to an East German mistake, Bush was criticized for his low-key response. But Bush had made a deliberate choice not to humiliate the Soviets or gloat: “I won’t beat on my chest and dance on the wall,” was his response – a model of emotional intelligence in a leader. Such self-restraint helped to set the stage for the successful Malta Summit with Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev a month later. The Cold War ended quietly, and the dismantlement of the Soviet empire followed. As Bush and his team responded to forces that were largely outside of his control, he set goals and objectives that balanced opportunities and constraints in a prudent manner. Some critics have faulted him for not supporting the national aspirations of Soviet republics like Ukraine in 1991 (when he delivered his infamous “Chicken Kiev” speech warning against “suicidal nationalism”); for failing to go to Baghdad to unseat Saddam Hussein in the Gulf War; or for sending Brent Scowcroft to Beijing to maintain relations with China after the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989. But, in each instance, Bush was limiting his short-term gains in order to pursue long-term stability. Other critics complained that Bush did not set more transformational objectives regarding Russian democracy, the Middle East, or nuclear non-proliferation at a time when world politics seemed fluid. But, again, Bush remained more focused on maintaining global stability than on advancing new visions. Bush was also respectful of institutions and norms at home and abroad, going to the US Congress for authorization of the Gulf War, and to the United Nations for a resolution under Chapter 7 of the UN Charter. Although a realist in his thinking, he could be Wilsonian in his tactics. Bush’s termination of the ground war in Iraq after only four days was motivated in part by humanitarian concerns about the slaughter of Iraqi troops, as well as by an interest in not leaving Iraq so weakened that it could not balance the power of neighboring Iran. While Bush’s invasion of Panama to capture (and later put on trial) Manuel Noriega may have violated Panamanian sovereignty, it had a degree of de facto legitimacy, given Noriega’s notorious behavior. And, when Bush organized his international coalition to prosecute the Gulf War, he included several Arab countries – not to ensure military success, but to boost the mission’s legitimacy. When Bush and Thatcher met in Aspen, Colorado, in the summer of 1990, Thatcher allegedly warned him “not to go wobbly.” But most historians agree there was no such danger. With his careful combination of hard and soft power, Bush created a successful strategy – one that accomplished American goals in a manner that was not unduly insular and with minimal damage to the interests of foreigners. He was careful not to humiliate Gorbachev, and to manage the transition to Boris Yeltsin’s presidency in a newly independent Russia. Of course, not all foreigners were adequately protected. For example, Bush assigned a low priority to Kurds and Shia in Iraq, to dissidents in China, and to Bosnians in the former Yugoslavia. In that sense, Bush’s realism set limits to his cosmopolitanism. Could Bush have done more had he been a transformational leader like Thatcher or Reagan? Perhaps he might have done more in a second term. And, with better communication skills, he might have been able to do more to educate the American public about the changing nature of the post-Cold War world. But, given the profound uncertainty of a world in flux, as well as the dangers of miscalculation as the Soviet empire collapsed, prudent management trumped grand visions. Bush famously said that he did not do “the vision thing.” Nonetheless, few people at the end of 1989 believed that Germany could be reunited peacefully within the Western alliance. Thatcher certainly did not. The lesson is that in some circumstances, we should prefer leadership by good transactional managers like George H. W. Bush (or Dwight Eisenhower before him), rather than by more flashy and inspirational transformers.",
            "为非空想主义者辩护 牛津—玛格丽特·撒切尔去世后，很多最新纪念文章称赞她是带来伟大变革的“转型”领袖。 经常被提到的还有她的美国转型同侪罗纳德·里根。 但更有趣的比较是把她和另一位美国总统放在一起 — — 老布什。 尽管通常被贬低为“事务性”管理者，老布什却拥有着过去半个世纪的最佳外交政策记录。 他的政府让冷战结束，目睹了苏联的解体，让德国在北约框架内实现了重新统一 — — 所有这些都没有使用暴力。 与此同时，他领导了广泛的由联合国支持的联盟，击退了萨达姆·侯赛因对科威特的入侵。 他在任何一个方面稍有闪失，当今世界就会糟糕得多。 尽管他主导了重要的全球转型，但就个人而言，老布什并没有转型目标。 在德国重新统一的问题上，它坚持撒切尔和其他人的意见，显然偏向于他的朋友、德国总理科尔而不顾公平。 1989年10月，老布什响应科尔的呼吁，公开声称他不“同意一些欧洲国家对重新统一的德国的担心 ” 。 与此同时，他小心翼翼地让科尔和其他人主导形势发展。 当一个月后柏林墙倒掉时（部分是因为东德的错误 ） ， 老布什因其反应太过低调而受到批评。 但老布什深思熟虑地选择不去羞辱苏联，也不幸灾乐祸 ： “ 我不会在柏林墙上手舞足蹈 ， ” 这就是他的反应 — — 堪称领袖心理智慧的样板。 如此自我克制帮助他成功地在一个月后于苏联总统戈尔巴乔夫举行了马耳他峰会。 冷战静悄悄地结束了，随之而来的苏联帝国的倒闭。 当老布什及其团队应对他所无法控制的力量时，他审慎地权衡机会和约束，设定目标和目的。 一些批评家挑他的刺，认为他不支持苏联加盟��和国的民族意愿（比如1991年的乌克兰，他做了臭名昭著的《基辅鸡 》 （ Chicken Kiev）演讲，警告“自杀式民族主义 ” ） 、批评他没能在海湾战争中进军巴格达把萨达姆赶下台、指责他在1989年天安门事件后派布伦特·斯考克罗夫特（Brent Scowcroft）前往北京维持与中国的关系。 但是，在所有这些事件中，老布什都为了长期稳定而牺牲短期利益。 也有批评家认为老布什没有在俄罗斯民主、中东和核不扩散问题上追求更有转型意义的目标 — — 当时的世界政坛波诡云谲。 但是，老布什扔更关注维持全球稳定而不是推行新愿景。 老布什还尊重国内外制度和范式，要求美国国会授权参与海湾战争，要求联合国根据联合国宪章第七条给出决议。 尽管他的思维是现实主义的，但在策略上，他是威尔逊主义的。 老布什在结束伊拉克地面战争开始仅仅四天后就鸣金，部分原因是出于伊拉克军队遭屠的人道主义考虑，也有部分是出于不能让伊拉克过于孱弱以至于无法制衡相邻的伊朗的利益计算。 老布什的入侵巴拿马并俘获（随后审判）曼努尔·诺列加（Manuel Noriega）也许破坏了巴拿马的主权，但这具有一定程度的实际合法性，因为诺列加是臭名昭著的暴君。 而当老布什组织多国联合控诉海湾战争时，他把一些阿拉伯国家也包括了进来 — — 这不是为了确保军事胜利，而是为了增加行动的合法性。 1990年夏，老布什和撒切尔在科罗拉多州阿斯彭（Aspen）举行会晤，据说撒切尔警告他“不要摇摆不定 ” 。 但大部分历史学家同意根本不存在这样的危险。 老布什小心翼翼地结合了硬实力和软实力，创造了成功的战略，以既不过于狭隘、又能将他国利益损害最小化的方式实现美国的目标。 他小心地不去羞辱戈尔巴乔夫，并完成了新成立的独立的俄罗斯向叶利钦做总统的过渡。 当然，并非所有外国人都得到了充分保护。 比如，老布什对伊拉克库尔德人和什叶派、中国持异见者和前南斯拉夫的波斯尼亚人就不那么上心。 从这个角度来说，老布什的现实主义限制了他的世界大同观。 如果老布什是像撒切尔和里根那样的转型领袖，他能做得更多吗？ 也许他可以在第二个任期做得更多。 而如果沟通技巧更好，他或许能更好地教育美国公众明白后冷战世界的变化本质。 但是，在流动世界的高度不确定性中，在错误估计苏联帝国解体的风险阴影笼罩下，审慎管理要胜于宏伟空想。 老布什有句名言，他不“做空想的事 ” 。 尽管如此，在1989年底，很少有人相信德国灰和平地重新统一并留在西方同盟中。 撒切尔显然不相信。 这表明，在某些环境中，我们应该看好作为优秀事务性管理者的领导人，比如老布什（以及他之前的艾森豪威尔 ） ， 而不是更犀利、更能激发人心的转型领导人。"

            "Should Business Travel Be Obsolete? COLOMBO – Think about it: You can call, email, and even watch your counterparty on FaceTime, Skype, or GoToMeeting. So why do companies fork out more than $1.2 trillion a year – a full 1.5% of the world’s GDP – for international business travel? The expense is not only huge; it is also growing – at 6.5% per year, almost twice the rate of global economic growth and almost as fast as information and telecommunication services. Computing power has moved from our laptops and cellphones to the cloud, and we are all better off for it. So why do we need to move brains instead of letting those brains stay put and just sending them bytes? Why waste precious work time in the air, at security checks, and waiting for our luggage? Before anyone starts slashing travel budgets, let’s try to understand why we need to move people rather than information. Thanks to a research collaboration on inclusive growth with MasterCard and an anonymized donation of data to the Center for International Development at Harvard University, we are starting to shed some light on this mystery. In ongoing work with Dany Bahar, Michele Coscia, and Frank Neffke, we have been able to establish some interesting stylized facts. More populous countries have more business travel in both directions, but the volume is less than proportional to their population: a country with 100% more population than another has only about 70% more business travel. This suggests that there are economies of scale in running businesses that favor large countries. By contrast, a country with a per capita income that is 100% higher than another receives 130% more business travelers and sends 170% more people abroad. This means that business travel tends to grow more than proportionally with the level of development. While businesspeople travel in order to trade or invest, more than half of international business travel seems to be related to the management of foreign subsidiaries. The global economy is increasingly characterized by global firms, which need to deploy their know-how to their different locations around the world. The data show that there is almost twice the amount of travel from headquarters to subsidiaries as there is in the opposite direction. Exporters also travel twice as much as importers. But why do we need to move the brain, not just the bytes? I can think of at least two reasons. First, the brain has a capacity to absorb information, identify patterns, and solve problems without us being aware of how it does it. That is why we can, for example, infer other people’s goals and intentions from facial expressions, body language, intonation, and other subtle indicators that we gather unconsciously. When we attend a meeting in person, we can listen to the body language, not just the spoken word, and we can choose where to look, not just the particular angle that the video screen shows. As a consequence, we are better able to evaluate, empathize, and bond in person than we can with today’s telecom technologies. Second, the brain is designed to work in parallel with other brains. Many problem-solving tasks require parallel computing with brains that possess different software and information but that can coordinate their thoughts. That is why we have design teams, advisory boards, inter-agency taskforces, and other forms of group interaction. Conference calls try to match this interaction, but it is hard to speak in turn or to see one another’s expressions when someone is talking. Conference calls have trouble replicating the intricacy of human conscious and unconscious group interactions that are critical to solve problems and accomplish tasks. The amount of travel should then be related to the amount of know-how that needs to be moved around. Countries differ in the amount of know-how they possess, and industries differ in the amount of know-how they require. Controlling for population and per capita income, travel is significantly more intense to and from countries and industries that possess or use more know-how. The countries that account for the most travel abroad, controlling for population, are all in Western Europe: Germany, Denmark, Belgium, Norway, and the Netherlands. Outside of Europe, the most travel-intensive countries are Canada, Israel, Singapore, and the United States, a reflection of the fact that they need to deploy many brains to make use of their diverse know-how. Interestingly, countries in the developing world differ substantially in the amount of know-how they receive through business travel. For example, countries such as South Africa, Bulgaria, Morocco, and Mauritius receive much more know-how than countries at similar levels of development such as Peru, Colombia, Chile, Indonesia, or Sri Lanka. The fact that firms incur the cost of business travel suggests that, for some key tasks, it is easier to move brains than it is to move the relevant information to the brains. Moreover, the fact that business travel is growing faster than the global economy suggests that output is becoming more intensive in know-how and that know-how is diffusing through brain mobility. And, finally, the huge diversity of business travel intensity suggests that some countries are deploying or demanding much more know-how than others. Rather than celebrate their thrift, countries that are out of the business travel loop should be worried. They may be missing out on more than frequent flyer miles.",
            "商务旅行应该淘汰吗？ 科伦坡—想一想：你可以在FaceTime、Skype或GoToMeeting上呼叫你的对手方、给他们发电邮，甚至与与他们面对面。 既然如此，为何公司每年还要花1.2万亿美元以上的钱 — — 足足相当于世界GDP的1.5 % — —用于国际商务旅行？ 开支不但巨大，而且还在增长 — — 每年6.5 % ， 几乎是全球经济增长的两倍，或者与信息和通讯服务业增长相当。 计算能力已经从笔记本和手机移动到云端，这让我们所有人都从中获益。 那么，为何我们还需要移动大脑，而不是让这些大脑留在原地，而只是传输大脑中的数据？ 为何要把宝贵的工作时间浪费在空中、安检门和等待行李上？ 在开始削减差旅预算前，让我们试着理解一下为何我们需要让人移动，而不是信息。 通过与万事达卡的联合包容增长研究，以及向哈佛大学国际发展中心的匿名数据捐赠，我们开始探索这一谜题并取得了一些洞见。 在与丹尼·巴哈尔（Dany Bahar ） 、 米歇尔·柯西亚（Michele Coscia）和弗兰克·尼福柯（Franke Neffke）的研究中，我们已经能够识别出一些有趣的典型事实。 人口较多的国家双向商务旅行也更多，但旅行量的增量不及人口比例：如果一个国家人口比另一个国家多100 % ， 其商务旅行量将只多出70%左右。 这表明营商存在有利于大国的规模经济。 相反，如果一国人均收入比另一国高100 % ， 那么它所接收的商务旅行者将多出130 % ， 它发出的商务旅行者将多出170 % 。 这意味着商务旅行增长比例要高于发展水平。 商务人士旅行的目的是做交易或投资，但超过一半的国际商务旅行与外国分支管理层有关。 全球经济中的全球企业越来越多，它们需要在全世界各地部署专业知识。 数据表明，从总部到分支的旅行量是相反方向的近两倍。 出口国旅行量是进口国的两倍。 但为什么我们需要移动大脑，而不仅仅是数据？ 我可以想到至少两个原因。 首先，大脑具有吸收信息、识别模式和解决问题的模式，我们根本不需要知道大脑如何做到这一点。 因此，我们能够（比如）在面部表情、肢体语言、语调和其他我们下意识收集到的微妙信号中推断他人的目标和意图。 当我们召开现场会议时，我们可以倾听肢体语言，而不仅仅是说出来的话，我们可以选择看哪里，而不仅仅是通过视频中的特殊角度。 因此，我们能够比通过当今通讯技术更好地评估他人、产生共鸣、建立纽带。 其次，大脑天生具有与其他大脑并行工作的能力。 许多解决问题的任务需要与拥有不同软件和信息，但能够协调思想的其他大脑进行并行计算。 因此我们有了设计团队、顾问委员会、跨部门任务小组和其他形式的集体互动。 电话会议试图取代这一互动，但在电话会议中很难依次发言或在某人正在发言时 观察彼此的表情。 电话会议无法复制人的意识和无意识集体互动的复杂性，而这种复杂性是解决问题、完成任务的关键。 因此，旅行量应该与有多少知识需要移动有关。 各国拥有的知识量不同，各行业所需要的知识量也不同。 控制人口和人均收入变量，拥有或使用更多知识的国家和行业，商务旅行的密集程度显著更高。 出国旅行量最大的国家（控制人口因素后）都在西欧：德国、丹麦、比利时、挪威和荷兰。 在欧洲之外，旅行最密集的国家为加拿大、以色列、新加坡和美国，这反映了一个事实：它们需要部署许多大脑来让它们多样化的知识派上用场。 有趣的是，发展中国家通过商务旅行所获得的知识量大相径庭。 比如，南非、保加利亚、摩洛哥和毛里求斯等国家所获得知识量远远多于发展水平相当的秘鲁、哥伦比亚、智利、印度尼西亚或斯里兰卡。 企业愿意承担商务旅行的成本，这一事实表明，对于一些关键性任务，移动大脑要比将相关信息传递给大脑更加容易。 此外，商务旅行比全球经济增长更快这一事实表明，产出的知识密集程度日益增加，而知识通过大脑的移动扩散。 最后，商务旅行密集程度的巨大差异表明一些国家比其他国家部署或需求更多的知识。 位于商务旅行环路之外的国家不应该因为节俭而自豪，而应该感到担忧。 它们也许已经被更加频繁地飞来飞去的国家远远甩在了身后。"

            "The Fabulist WASHINGTON, DC – In April 2011, Donald Trump, then considering a run for the presidency the following year, said that he had sent investigators to Hawaii to check out rumors that President Barack Obama wasn’t born there, but in Kenya, which would disqualify him for the presidency. His investigators, Trump declared, “cannot believe what they’re finding.” I can find no record of Trump being challenged on this outlandish claim at the time. In the fall of 2016, Trump, now the Republican presidential nominee, was convinced by his staff that he had to abandon this “birther” nonsense. He did so reluctantly, charging – also with no evidence – that such rumors had actually been initiated by his opponent, Hillary Clinton. There, in a nutshell, is Trump’s modus operandi: he’s not just a liar but a fabulist, seemingly unconcerned with whether his fictions will be exposed. If they are, the world simply moves on as he invents fresh distractions. Another distinctive trait of Trump’s presidency has been his systematic effort to dismantle the guard rails that are intended to limit executive power. The most recent example has been the firing of four inspectors-general, a genus of civil servant created after Watergate to act as independent checks on the conduct of federal agencies and their officials. Trump fired the acting inspector-general in the Department of Health and Human Services after her office reported a serious shortage of crucial equipment to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. Trump was even more eager to get rid of her when he learned she had worked in President Barack Obama’s administration, though she first joined the department during Bill Clinton’s presidency. In fact, Trump recently suggested that all the inspectors-general may be Obama-era holdovers – and therefore should be fired. Moreover, Trump’s fury over the investigation of his 2016 election campaign’s dealings with Russia and his impeachment in January – subjects that trigger his rage and vindictiveness – is still playing out. Virtually anyone involved in either episode is vulnerable. Two of the recently fired inspectors-general fall into those categories. Trump is usually too angry a man to stop before he harms himself, unless his aides persuade him otherwise. But his current aides, on the whole, aren’t as strong as before, and Trump is more confident in his own instincts. (He isn’t the first president to say to an aide, “I’m president and you’re not.”) And he’s getting a lot closer to an election that he could lose. Now, Trump is bent on discrediting the Russia investigation itself, which he has always deemed a “hoax” and “fake news.” So, with the aid of a cooperative attorney general, William Barr, he has set out to “prove” that there was no basis for launching it. When Barr took over the Justice Department in February 2019, he made it clear that he saw his job as being Trump’s defender and advocate. And Trump, who has no concept of public service, had become convinced that the federal government was composed of a “deep state” bent on destroying his presidency. This explains a lot of what has happened. Trump fired FBI director James Comey, who had resisted the former’s blandishments that he was to be the president’s subordinate, only to find himself facing a special counsel, Robert Mueller, appointed by the Justice Department. As far as Trump was concerned, Barr had to rein in the department. The complaisant Barr took actions that damaged both the president and himself. He had his prosecutors intervene to reduce a court sentence for Trump’s longtime political associate Roger Stone, prompting four federal prosecutors who had tried the case to resign. After the outcry among Justice Department employees died down, Barr even more flagrantly arranged for federal prosecutors to move to drop the charges against retired Lt. General Michael Flynn, the first of Trump’s four national security advisers (so far). Flynn who had twice admitted under oath to lying to the FBI about his secret conversations during the transition with the Russian ambassador to the US, Sergey Kislyak, and Trump fired him because he had also lied to Vice President Mike Pence about these talks. The move to drop the charges against Flynn led to the resignation of the case’s lead prosecutor and an uproar among established lawyers, both Republican and Democrat, who called on Barr to resign. The trial court judge in the Flynn case made the highly unusual decision to appoint an outside counsel to argue in court in June against Justice’s move to withdraw the charges. The erratic Flynn, a registered Democrat (Trump’s “lock her up” campaign slogan against Clinton notwithstanding), had been an admired intelligence officer in Afghanistan, but he needed level-headed supervision to temper his wilder conclusions. After he was promoted to head the Defense Intelligence Agency, he floundered, leading Obama to fire him. Obama also advised Trump not to hire him as national security adviser. Flynn’s resulting bitterness toward Obama makes him a useful instrument in Trump’s latest plot: to destroy his popular predecessor’s standing as an advocate for former Vice President Joe Biden, Trump’s presumptive opponent in this year’s election. But, for Flynn to be useful, he can’t be a convict, and the charges regarding his calls to the Russian ambassador must be expunged in order to claim that there was no basis for the Mueller investigation. On May 15, Trump claimed in a tweet that Obama, who ran one of the cleanest administrations in decades, had participated in “the greatest political scandal in the history of the US.” But Trump has yet to say just what “Obamagate” is. Has Trump finally spun a fable that he can’t get away with? Barr, now expressing concern that the Justice Department can’t be “political,” has just said that Obama and Biden won’t be prosecuted, taking Trump by surprise. With 100,000 in the US expected to have died from COVID-19 by June 1, and with unemployment soaring to 1930s levels, American voters are more likely to be more interested in their health, safety, and jobs than anything Flynn has to say about Obama.",
            "说谎者 华盛顿—2011年4月，当时唐纳德·特朗普正在考虑第2年竞选总统，特朗普表示他已经派调查人员前往夏威夷，查证巴拉克·奥巴马总统在肯尼亚而非夏威夷出生的传言，如果查证属实，奥巴马将不再有资格竞选总统。 他派去的调查人员，特朗普宣称 ， “ 无法相信他们所发现的事是真的 。 ” 我找不到当时特朗普因为这一古怪说法而遭到质疑的记录。 2016年秋，已经是共和党总统候选人的特朗普被自己的幕僚所说服，不得不放弃这种荒唐的“出生地指控 ” 。 他这样做心不甘情不愿，在没有任何证据的情况下，指责上述谣言的实际发起者是他的竞争对手希拉里·克林顿。 简言之，这就是特朗普的做事方式：他不仅是骗子，而且是小说家，对他所编造的谎言是否会被戳穿似乎毫不关心。 就算真的被戳穿，他所发明的新的干扰也会让这个世界继续前进。 特朗普总统任期的另一个显著特点是：他一直在有计划地拆除旨在限制行政权力的护栏。 最近的例子是解雇4位总检察长，这是在水门事件后设立的负责独立核查联邦机构及其官员行为的一类公务员。 特朗普解雇了卫生和公共服务部代理检察长，因为她的办公室报告，应对2019年新冠疫情大流行的关键设备严重短缺。 特朗普在得知此人曾为巴拉克·奥巴马总统内阁工作后就更加迫不及待地想要摆脱她，尽管她早在比尔·克林顿总统任职期间就已经加入了该部门。 事实上，特朗普最近提出所有检察长都是奥巴马时代的遗留物 — — 因此应当遭到被解雇的命运。 此外，时间并没有平息对特朗普2016年总统竞选期间与俄罗斯来往调查及其1月遭到弹劾（上述问题引发了他的报复和愤怒）所引发的愤怒。 参与事件的几乎任何人都处于危险之中。 最近被解雇的两名检察长就属于这一范畴。 特朗普的愤怒往往导致他无法在损害自己前停手，除非他能被自己的助手所说服。 但总体而言，他目前的助手实力有所减弱，而且特朗普更相信自己的直觉。 （他不是第1个对助手说 ， “ 我是总统，而你不是”的总统。 ）而且他离输掉选举越来越近了。 现在，特朗普一心一意想要抹杀俄罗斯调查本身，他一直将上述调查视为“骗局”和“虚假新闻 ” 。 因此，在乐于配合的总检察长威廉·巴尔的协助下，他开始着手“证明”这项调查根本没有依据启动。 当巴尔在2019年2月接管司法部时，他明确表示，他将自己的工作视为特朗普的捍卫者和拥护者。 而特朗普没有任何公共服务观念，并确信联邦政府由所谓致力于摧毁其总统任期的“深暗势力”所组成。 这解释了已经发生的许多事情。 特朗普解雇了联邦调查局局长詹姆斯·科米，因为科米不接受特朗普的劝诱，拒绝充当他的下属。 之后特朗普发现自己不得不面对司法部任命的特别检察官罗伯特·穆勒。 在特朗普看来，巴尔必须控制司法部。 殷勤恭顺的巴尔采取了有损总统及其本人的行动。 他要求手下检察官介入，减轻对特朗普长期政治伙伴罗杰·斯通的法庭判决，从而引发4名审理此案的联邦检察官辞职抗议。 待司法部员工的强烈抗议逐渐平息后，巴尔甚至更明目张胆地安排联邦检察官撤销对退休中将迈克尔·弗林的指控 ， （ 迄今为止）弗林在特朗普的4名国家安全顾问中居首。 弗林曾两次宣誓承认，在俄罗斯驻美大使谢尔盖·基斯里亚克过渡期间就与其秘密谈话向联邦调查局说谎，而且他还因为就上述谈话向副总统迈克·彭斯说谎而被特朗普解雇。 撤销对弗林的指控导致此案首席检察官辞职，并引起共和及民主两党知名律师的骚动。 他们呼吁巴尔辞去司法部长职务。 弗林案的初审法院法官做出了一个极为不同寻常的决定，即指定一名外聘律师于6月出庭反对法官撤诉的举动。 喜怒无常的弗林是一位注册在案的民主党人（尽管特朗普提出了针对克林顿的“把她关起来”的竞选口号 ） ， 弗林曾经是阿富汗一位备受尊敬的情报官员，但他需要一位头脑清醒的上级来限制他所做出的疯狂结论。 在被提拔担任国防情报局局长后，弗林陷入了困境，并被奥巴马解雇。 奥巴马还建议特朗普不要聘请他担任国家安全顾问。 弗林因此对奥巴马所产生的仇恨使之成为特朗普最新阴谋的有益工具：那就是摧毁其颇受欢迎的前任作为前副总统乔·拜登的拥护者地位，而后者是特朗普在今年大选中的假定对手。 但弗林要想发挥作用，他就不能被宣判有罪，因此必须取消对其致电俄罗斯大使的指控，只有这样才能声称穆勒的调查缺乏依据。 5月15日，特朗普在推文中宣称，执掌数10年来最干净政府之一的奥巴马曾参与了“美国历史上最严重的政治丑闻 。 ” 但特朗普还没有透露“奥巴马门”的具体内容。 特朗普是否最终编造了他无法逃脱的谎言？ 巴尔现在对司法部不能过于“政治化”表示了担忧，并刚刚表示奥巴马和拜登不会被起诉，而这导致特朗普大吃一惊。 因为截止6月1日， 美国将有10万人死于2019年新冠病毒，而且失业率飙升至1930年代水平，因此美国选民可能对自身健康、安全和就业更感兴趣，而不会在意弗林对奥巴马的指控。"

            "Why Tuberculosis Persists SAN FRANCISCO – It surprises many people in Europe and North America that tuberculosis (TB) remains one of the great scourges in human history. One out of every three people in the world is infected with latent or sub-clinical TB, and scientists predict that 10% of them will manifest the disease as age and other illnesses compromise their immune systems. In 2015, more than ten million new cases of TB were reported, and almost two million people died from it. There are three reasons why TB persists: political leaders do not understand the sociology behind it, scientists lack an effective paradigm to attack it, and the rich and famous no longer die from it. TB once affected every stratum of society, but it now afflicts the most vulnerable populations. This makes it an ideal meme for artists and activists who focus on social justice. The incidence of drug-resistant TB is on the rise, because the health-care systems of poor countries lack the resources to screen for TB and to help patients comply with their therapies. Six countries – India, Indonesia, China, Nigeria, Pakistan, and South Africa – account for 60% of all reported TB cases. Russia may be willfully underreporting its TB burden, and some African countries do not know how many of their citizens are infected. Political leaders have failed to understand the sociological factors behind TB. For example, the disease’s prevalence does not usually increase after natural disasters, but it did in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake, owing partly to the policies of the United Nations and USAID. Refugee camps were crowded, the sanitation was poor, children were chronically malnourished, and financial incentives caused many to extend their stay there. TB afflicts many people who do not vote, such as refugees, prisoners, and the destitute. Prisons and slums also serve as breeding grounds for TB, and young women on the periphery of society can infect their children. The World Health Organization states that TB-infected mothers are “associated with a six-fold increase in perinatal deaths.” Mother Teresa worked for decades with TB’s victims in the slums of Calcutta, and observed that, “The biggest disease today is not leprosy or tuberculosis, but rather the feeling of being unwanted.” Discrimination, stigma, and isolation are not just pernicious features of weak societies; they foster conditions that facilitate TB infections and increase the rate of diffusion. Partners in Health (PIH), which runs TB clinics in South America, the Caribbean, and Africa, may be among those who get it right. Peter Drobac, who ran their programs, told me that PIH trains people in small villages to identify the disease early and to administer treatment properly, as well as to build policy systems that focus on the underlying values of self-determination and compassion, which strengthen any society. Innovation often comes from introducing insights and tools from a different domain. Maybe TB behaves more like cancer than like other infectious diseases. Daryl Drummond – a vice president of Merrimack Pharmaceuticals and one of the innovators behind the only second-line treatment for pancreatic cancer approved by the US Food and Drug Administration – told me that the lung lesions from a TB infection “share a marked similarity with solid tumors.” In fact, he explained, “the TB granuloma has many of the pathological features of cancer: hypoxia, a necrotic core, fibrous collagen at the outer rim, the development of a surrounding capillary network, and the presence of phagocytic cells.” If Drummond is right, those engaged in the fight against TB could look for ways in other branches of medicine to shorten treatment duration, lower dosing frequency, reduce side effects, lower costs, and improve compliance, all at the same time. Drummond added, “We are finding ways to achieve these things in oncology.\" Unfortunately, commercial innovation is slow to respond to TB. As World Bank President and PIH co-founder Jim Yong Kim points out, “If you look at the three major killers – HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria – the only disease for which we have really good drugs is HIV. The reason is simple: there’s a market in the United States and Europe.” TB, by contrast, is often thought of as a “third-world” or poor person’s disease. Some of the most profitable and powerful pharmaceutical companies in the world, AstraZeneca and Pfizer, have left that “market” behind. Tony Fauci, Director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which, since 1984, has helped to lead successful global efforts against HIV and Zika, takes a different perspective. “Collectively,” he reminds us, “we should be paying more attention to what is going on around us in the world among people who don’t have the advantages that we have.” North Americans and Europeans need to lift their fingers out of “the greasy till of commerce” and see the end of TB as a challenge to our collective humanity. It has certainly been a challenge to many of history’s greatest artists and activists. Henry David Thoreau, Eleanor Roosevelt, George Orwell, Franz Kafka, Louis Braille, Wallace Thurman, and Simón Bolívar struggled with or against alienation, isolation, and injustice. They all died of TB. Nelson Mandela was diagnosed with TB while serving his 27-year prison term in a dank cell. Two liters of fluid were drained from his chest, and he recuperated in a hospital that had never treated a black patient. If such eminent people contracted TB today, how fast could our governments and corporations find a cure? How many of the 400,000 children who die from TB each year could grow up, fight for social justice through art, activism, and commerce, and inspire the rest of us to do the same?",
            "结核病为什么无法根除 旧金山 — — 欧洲和北美许多人惊讶地看到结核病仍然是人类历史上最严重的灾难之一。 世界每三个人中就有一个人感染了潜伏性或亚临床结核病，而且科学家预测其中10%会随着年龄增长和其他疾病影响免疫系统而表现出结核病的症状。 2015年报告了超过1000万例新增结核病，而且近200万人因此而死亡。 有三个原因导致结核病无法根除：政治领袖不懂它背后的社会学、科学家缺乏有效的方式来打击它，而结核病不再对名人和富豪的生命构成威胁。 结核病曾影响到社会的各个阶层，现在却只对最弱势群体构成影响。 它因此成为专注社会正义的艺术家和活动人士的理想对象。 耐药性结核病的发病率正在上升，因为贫穷国家的医疗卫生系统缺乏筛查结核病的资源和帮助患者接受治疗的方法。 印度、印尼、中国、尼日利亚、巴基斯坦和南非等六国在所有报告结核病例中占据60%的份额。 俄罗斯可能有意隐瞒其结核病例，而有些非洲国家则不清楚国内有多少民众感染。 政治领袖未能掌握结核病背后的社会学因素。 例如，自然灾害通常不会增加结核病感染率，但2010年海地地震后却部分因联合国和美国国际开发署的政策而导致结核发病率有所增加。 难民营拥挤不堪，卫生条件极差；儿童长期营养不良，而经济刺激导致很多人长期在那里生活。 很多感染结核病的人没有投票权，包括难民、囚犯和贫困人口。 监狱和贫民窟也是结核病的孳生地，生活在社会边缘的年轻女性可能感染她们的后代。 世卫组织称感染结核病的母亲“围产期死亡率增长六倍之多 ” 。 特蕾莎修女曾在加尔各答贫民窟与结核病患者相处数十年，她观察的结果是 ， “ 当今最严重的疾病不是麻风病和结核病，而是被社会抛弃的感觉 。 ” 歧视、耻辱和孤立不仅是弱势群体的致命特点；它们加速结核病感染，并增加感染率。 我们或许可以借鉴在南美、加勒比和非洲开设结核病诊所的健康伙伴机构（PIH）的做法。 负责管理项目的彼得·达罗巴奇告诉我健康伙伴机构对村民进行培训，教会他们迅速识别早期结核病并正确地加以治疗，健康伙伴机构还努力建设关注自决和同情等基本价值观的政策体系，这样的体系能使任何社会的抗风险能力得到加强。 创新往往源于全新领域认识能力和工具的引入。 或许与其他传染病相比结核病与癌症具有更高的相似度。 美国联邦药品管理局批准的唯一胰腺癌二线药品发明者，梅里马克制药公司副总裁达里尔·德拉蒙德告诉我结核病感染造成的肺部病变“与实体肿瘤非常相像 。 ” 事实上，结核性肉芽肿具有许多癌症的病理特征：组织缺氧、核心坏死、外缘胶原纤维化、周遭发展出毛细血管网和出现吞噬细胞。 如果德拉蒙德所言不虚，那么结核病防治工作者可以在其他医学领域寻找同时能缩短治疗时间、降低给药频率、降低成本和改善依从性的方法。 德拉蒙德补充道 ， “ 我们正在想法设法在肿瘤治疗中达到上述目标 。 ” 不幸的是，商业创新对结核病响应迟缓。 正如世行行长兼健康伙伴机构创始人金墉所指出的那样 ， “ 在三大主要杀手 — — 艾滋病、结核病及疟疾中 — — 唯一有特效药可用的是艾滋病。 原因很简单：美国和欧洲有市场 。 ” 相比之下，结核病往往被视为属于“第三世界”或者穷人。 全球某些最大最赚钱的制药企业，如阿斯利康和辉瑞，都对结核病“市场”不屑一顾。 1984年来协助领导全球抗击艾滋病和寨卡工作的美国国家过敏和传染病研究所主任托尼·福奇的观点与众不同。 “作为整体 ” ， 他提醒我们 ， “ 我们应当更关注周边国家劣势群体所过的生活 。 ” 北美及欧洲人必须从“油腻腻的商业钱匣中”抽出手来，将消灭结核病视为全人类的共同事业。 结核病对历史上很多伟大艺术家和活动家而言无疑是一个挑战。 亨利·大卫·梭罗、埃莉诺·罗斯福、乔治·奥威尔、弗兰茨·卡夫卡、路易斯·布莱叶、华莱士·瑟曼和西蒙·玻利瓦尔都曾反抗异化、隔离和不公正。 他们都是死于结核病。 纳尔逊·曼德拉在一间阴暗牢房完成其27年刑期期间被诊断出结核病。 从他的胸部抽出了两升液体，他在一家从未治疗过黑人患者的医院接受治疗。 如果这样的知名人士今天患上结核病，我们的政府和企业多快能找到治愈方法？ 每年死于结核病的400,000儿童有多少本来可以长大成人，通过艺术、社会活动和商业为社会平等而战，并激励我们其他人加入到这项事业当中？"

            "Why Turkey's Army Will Stay Home Just when the smoke from Turkey’s domestic political conflicts of the past year had begun to clear, another deadly attack by Kurdish separatists on Turkish soldiers has the government threatening military attacks inside northern Iraq. That prospect raises risks for Turkey, Iraq, and the United States. But there are reasons to doubt that the situation is as dangerous as recent headlines suggest. Turkey accuses Iraqi Kurds of harboring between 3,000 and 3,500 of Turkey’s most active Kurdish militants – the PKK separatist guerillas who are blamed for the deaths of 80 Turkish soldiers so far this year. The trouble reached the boiling point on October 7, when Kurdish fighters killed 13 Turkish soldiers near Turkey’s border with Iraq. The Turkish public has demanded action, and Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s government has responded. On October 17, despite pleas for patience and restraint from Iraq and the US, Turkish lawmakers voted 507-19 to authorize Erdogan to order cross-border military strikes into Iraq at any time over the next year. Erdogan has sent Iraqi Kurds a forceful message. But, for several reasons, the Turkish military is likely to limit its operations to small-scale incursions and air strikes on specific targets rather than launch an all-out war. First, the Turkish military has no interest in embracing the risks that come with involvement in Iraq’s sectarian strife. A full-scale invasion might well provoke Iraq’s own Kurdish guerrillas into a prolonged and bloody battle with Turkish forces that can only undermine support for Erdogan’s government at home and abroad. Second, Turkey’s government hopes to keep the country’s bid to join the European Union moving forward. An invasion of Iraq would bring that process to a grinding halt. EU Foreign Policy chief Javier Solana has made plain that Europe strongly opposes any large-scale Turkish military operation in Iraq. Third, Turkey is well aware that an all-out attack inside Iraq is exactly what Turkey’s Kurdish separatists want. What better way to damage Turkey than to pull its military into conflict with Iraq, the US, and the EU? Erdogan has no intention of being drawn into that trap. With all that in mind, this latest move by Turkey’s parliament should be seen more as an ultimatum to Iraq’s Kurdish Regional Government to expel the Turkish Kurds and an attempt to persuade the US to use its considerable influence there. That’s hardball politics, not a declaration of war. The parliamentary authorization itself is carefully worded to underline Turkey’s limited aims. It stresses that Turkey’s military has no intention of occupying Iraqi territory or threatening Iraqi Kurds or their oil infrastructure. An attack would certainly make Iraq’s Kurdish provinces less appealing for foreign investors. But Turkey has no reason to attack the assets of foreign oil companies. Iraq’s central government is aware of the risks, as well, and is likely to exercise maximum restraint. A limited Turkish strike into northern Iraq would probably elicit little reaction beyond public condemnation and rhetorical assertions of Iraqi sovereignty. Threats to Iraq’s oil infrastructure around the northern Iraqi city of Kirkuk and other territory under the Kurdish Regional Government’s control are minimal. Turkey’s government knows that any move to shut down the 600-mile pipeline from Kirkuk to Turkey’s Mediterranean port at Ceyhan would have little near-term impact, since most of Iraq’s oil exports flow from the south, hundreds of miles from the country’s border with Turkey. Furthermore, the Turkish military can increase the pressure on Iraqi Kurds with far less drastic measures. It can close the two countries’ principal border crossing, an important route for food, fuel, and other goods headed for Iraqi Kurds. It could also cut exports of electricity to northern Iraq. Still, even small-scale military operations would generate risk. If the PKK is able to launch a major attack on troops or civilians inside Turkey, the public outcry might leave Erdogan with little choice but to up the ante. The issue is complicated further by Turkey’s refusal to negotiate directly with the Kurdish Regional Government in northern Iraq. Such talks, Turkey fears, would offer tacit acknowledgement that Iraqi Kurds have won a degree of autonomy from Baghdad. That’s a bridge too far for Turkey’s nationalists and its military. There are risks for Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al Maliki as well, because Turkish military strikes on Iraq’s northern provinces could undermine the Kurdish support on which his government increasingly depends. Both Sunni Arabs and Kurds already resent al Maliki’s mild reaction to Iran’s recent shelling of Iraqi territory – an attempt to strike at Iranian Kurdish militants fleeing across its border with Iraq. There are also risks for the US. Most supplies headed for US troops in Iraq and Afghanistan move through the Incirlik airbase in Turkey. With the threat that the US House of Representatives will approve a resolution that accuses Turks of genocide against ethic Armenians nine decades ago, this is a particularly inopportune moment for the two countries to be at odds over Iraq. But, worst-case scenarios aside, a Turkish invasion of northern Iraq can only serve the interests of Turkey’s Kurdish separatists. That’s why cooler heads are likely to prevail. Limited cross-border operations are increasingly likely. A war between Turkey and Iraqi Kurds is not.",
            "为什么土耳其的军队会呆在国内 正当过去一年土耳其国内政治斗争的硝烟刚刚开始散去时，库尔德分离主义者攻击土耳其军队导致多名军人死亡的事件使政府威胁要在伊拉克北部实施军队打击。 这种前景给土耳其、伊拉克和美国都带来了巨大的风险。 但是有理由怀疑形势是否真的像最近报纸大字标题上所写的那样危险。 土耳其谴责伊拉克库尔德地区藏匿了3000到3500名土耳其最最活跃的库尔德武装分子库尔德工人党分离主义者的游击队员，他们被指责在今年已经造成了80名土耳其军人死亡。 这个问题在10月7日达到了沸点，当天库尔德武装分子在土耳其与伊拉克交界附近打死了13名土耳其军人。 土耳其公众要求采取行动，并且埃尔多安总理领导的政府也作出了反应。 10月17日，尽管伊拉克和美国都呼吁保持耐心和克制，但是土耳其的立法者还是以507票赞成对19票反对授权埃尔多安在明年的任何时间下令越境进入伊拉克实施军事打击。 埃尔多安向伊拉克库尔德人发出了一个有力的信息。 但是，有好几个原因会使土耳其军队很可能把它的军事行动限制在小规模的入侵和对特定目标实施空中打击上，而不会爆发一场全面战争。 首先，土耳其军队并不想面对介入伊拉克的宗派斗争所带来的风险。 全面入侵很可能会激起伊拉克国内的库尔德游击队员与土耳其军队进行一场漫长而又血腥的斗争，这只会削弱埃尔多安政府在国内和国际所受到的支持。 第二，土耳其政府希望继续这个国家加入欧盟的进程。 而入侵伊拉克会使这一进程嘎然而止。 欧盟负责外交事务的高级代表索拉纳已经明确表示欧洲强烈反对土耳其军队在伊拉克境内实施任何大规模的军事行动。 第三，土耳其很清楚在伊拉克境内实施全面军事打击正是土耳其的库尔德分离主义者所梦寐以求的。 还有什么比把土耳其的军队拉上与伊拉克、美国还有欧盟对抗之路更能损害它的利益的呢？ 埃尔多安是不愿意掉进这个陷阱的。 正因为考虑到这些原因，土耳其议会最近的举动应该更多地被看作是要求伊拉克库尔德地区政府驱逐土耳其库尔德人的最后通牒以及试图劝说美国发挥其在当地相当的影响力。 这是强硬方式的政治，而不是宣战。 议会的授权本身用词也很谨慎，强调土耳其的有限目标。 它强调说土耳其的军队并不想占领伊拉克的领土或者威胁伊拉克库尔德人抑或他们的石油基础设施。 一次打击很可能会使伊拉克的库尔德省份对外国投资者不再那么有吸引力。 但是土耳其没有理由攻击外国的石油公司。 伊拉克中央政府很清楚风险所在，并且很可能会保持最大限度的克制。 土耳其对伊拉克北部地区实施的有限的军事打击除开会使伊拉克当局作出公开谴责和口头宣称伊拉克的主权外，不会再引起其他反应。 对伊拉克北部城市基尔库克周围的石油基础设施和库尔德地区政府控制下的领土的威胁是非常小的。 土耳其政府知道任何关闭由基尔库克通向土耳其位于地中海的查伊汉港600英里长的石油管道的行动近期不太可能产生多少影响，因为伊拉克石油出口的大部分是从南部出去的，与该国跟土耳其的交界处相隔了数百英里。 此外，土耳其军队运用远没有那么猛烈的措施就能给伊拉克库尔德人增加压力。 它还可以关闭两国主要的过境通道，这是运往伊拉克库尔德地区的食品、燃料和其他物资的重要路线。 它还可以减少输往伊拉克北部地区的电力。 然而，即便是小��模的军事行动也会带来风险。 如果库尔德工人党能够对土耳其境内的军队或平民发动一次重大打击，公众的强烈抗议会使埃尔多安除了增加赌注外别无选择。 这个问题因为土耳其拒绝与伊拉克北部的库尔德地区政府进行直接谈判而变得更加复杂了。 土耳其方面担心这种谈判会等同于默认伊拉克库尔德人已经从巴格达获得了一定程度的自治权。 那对于土耳其的民族主义者和它的军队来说是不太可能做的。 伊拉克总理马利基也承受着一定的风险，因为土耳其军队在伊拉克北部省份实施的军事打击会严重削弱他的政府越来越依赖的库尔德人的支持。 逊尼派阿拉伯人和库尔德人都对马利基对于伊朗最近轰炸伊拉克领土的行动 — — 以便打击通过越境逃到伊拉克境内的一支伊朗库尔德人武装力量 — — 所作出的温和反应深表不满。 美国同样也承受着风险。 大部分运往驻扎在伊拉克和阿富汗的美国军队的物资都是通过土耳其的因切利克空军机场进行的。 面对美国众议院威胁要通过一项谴责土耳其人在90年前对亚美尼亚族人实施种族灭绝的决议，两国在伊拉克问题上产生分歧真是显得特别不合时宜。 但是，除这些最糟糕的状况，土耳其对伊拉克北部的入侵只会使土耳其的库尔德分离主义者得益。 正因为如此，头脑清醒的人到最后很可能会占据上风。 有限的越境军事行动的可能性变得越来越大了。 但是土耳其与伊拉克库尔德人爆发战争却并不太可能。"

            "Why Ukraine Deserves a Haircut LONDON – In addition to its many other troubles, Ukraine now finds itself in a showdown with its creditors. Investors holding high-yielding bonds – many of them bought at heavy discounts after Russia’s annexation of Crimea last year – are demanding to be paid in full. Ukraine’s government, for its part, argues that the country’s financial difficulties – in particular the economic effects of the conflict and the plunge in the value of the hryvnia – have made its debt burden unsustainable. The outcome of this standoff could determine Ukraine’s future, as much as the military confrontation with Russia. Recent developments have put the country on a path that would have been unimaginable until very recently. For the first time in Ukraine’s post-Soviet history, it has a government that is willing and able to carry out real reform. Ukraine’s progress, however, could not be more fragile. Without some form of debt relief, it could easily be lost. A little over a year ago, Ukraine did not have an elected president or a representative and functioning parliament. The political landscape was deeply fragmented. Civil society had been energized by the Maidan revolution that ousted former President Viktor Yanukovych, but it was in turmoil. Debate over the association agreement with the European Union, along with the Russian-backed rebellion in the east, had stoked tensions over distinctions that previously played little or no role in people’s lives. But since parliamentary elections in October, Ukraine has begun to pull itself together. Russia’s intervention has to some extent backfired, strengthening support for a European orientation. Eastern Ukraine may have voted differently from the rest of the country, but the overwhelming majority of voters came out in favor of Europe. The electorate also said no to the more virulent forms of nationalism, leaving the right-wing extremist parties marginalized. The result of the elections was the formation of a five-party governing coalition. Though seemingly fragile, it has held up remarkably well. Some of its members have displayed worrying populist tendencies, but an analysis of parliamentary voting patterns indicates that so far the coalition has been able to find agreement, even on very difficult issues. The government has, among other things, raised gas tariffs by 450% (from absurdly low levels). Dissension has been relatively moderate. As a result, Ukraine’s core institutions are undergoing fundamental change. The central bank – once in the pocket of the country’s oligarchs, supplying inside information on exchange rates and liquidity in exchange for bribes – has been put under the command of a governor committed to reform, surrounded by an increasingly professional team. The energy monopoly Naftogaz, previously a cesspool of illicit transactions, has in a year managed the seemingly impossible: making Ukraine virtually independent from direct gas delivery from Russia for at least a year. Perhaps Ukraine’s single most important achievement is the establishment of the National Reform Council. Originally set up to coordinate reforms across ministries and monitor their implementation, it has come to serve as an important tool to discuss and ensure coherence among the different branches of government. This latter role is particularly important, given the constitutional ambiguity created by the reversion back to a parliamentary system and the uneasy co-habitation of President Petro Poroshenko and Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk in government. Meetings are held every three weeks and are attended by the president, the prime minister, and his entire cabinet, providing a forum in which tensions can be discussed and eased. In between meetings, the council’s special project-management office assists in the preparation and implementation of key reforms by ministries. With support from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the George Soros-funded International Renaissance Foundation, and bilateral assistance from, among others, the Swedish government, the office has been able to hire staff at market rates, raising the quality of the government administration. Ukraine’s government has also benefited from the expertise of private-sector leaders. Deputy Head of the Presidential Administration Dmytro Shymkiv, who drove the National Reform Council, was CEO of Microsoft Ukraine. Finance Minister Natalie Jaresko and Economic Development and Trade Minister Aivaras Abromavicius were both investment bankers (neither was a Ukrainian citizen when they joined the government). Infrastructure Minister Andriy Pivovarsky, also a former investment banker, was most recently CEO of Continium, one of the country’s largest holding companies. Each has played a key role in pushing the reform agenda forward, working for salaries that are orders of magnitude smaller than what they earned before. Some have even employed staff using their own money. Meanwhile, the ambitious agendas of the government ministers and the presidential administration are closely monitored by an energized civil society. As Soros has noted, Ukraine probably has the most active civil society in Europe. One of the country’s most interesting new ventures is VoxUkraine, a blogging platform set up by two Ukrainian economics professors based in the United States, Yuriy Gorodnichenko and Timofiy Mylovanov. They have championed modern evidence-based decision-making and constantly come up with new, constructive ways of challenging the government and its assumptions. Despite all this progress, however, the odds remain stacked against the country. The government is fighting at least two wars simultaneously – taking on a deeply entrenched oligarchy, while trying to fend off its hostile eastern neighbor. Further trouble – in the form a steeply declining economy – is something it cannot afford. The stakes could not be higher. For the first time since the country gained its independence in 1992, Ukraine has a clear sense of direction and a government capable of supporting reform. There are signs that the oligarchs’ grip is beginning to loosen, owing partly to internal conflicts among them. The EU and the US are working to help resolve its conflict with Russia. Ukraine’s private creditors must now do their part, recognize the country’s economic and political situation, and accept a haircut on their bonds. Neither the Ukrainian economy – nor its political system – can afford that they do otherwise.",
            "为何乌克兰债券需要减值 发自伦敦 — — 除了自身众多问题之外，乌克兰如今也到了跟其债权人摊牌的时候。 那些持有高息债券 — — 其中许多都是在去年俄罗斯吞并克里米亚之后大幅折价购入 — — 的投资者都在要求连本带息全额支付。 而乌克兰政府方面则声称本国所面对的经济困难 — — 尤其是军事冲突带来的经济冲击和本国货币格里夫尼亚的大幅贬值 — — 使得自身债务负担无以为继。 这一对峙状况的结果将和与俄罗斯的军事冲突一道觉得这个国家的未来。 最近局势的发展已经将乌克兰推向了一条原本无法想象的道路。 在苏联解体之后，乌克兰首次建立了一个有意愿且有能力推动真正改革的政府。 然而乌克兰的进步之路也极之脆弱。 如果无法实现某种形式的债务削减的话，就会轻易灰飞烟灭。 就在不到一年之前，乌克兰还缺乏一位民选总统，也没有一个具有代表性和正常运作的议会。 整个政治图景极为碎片化。 公民社会在推翻了前总统维克多·亚努科维奇（Viktor Yanukovych）的广场革命驱动下建立了起来，但如今却陷入了混乱。 针对欧盟联系国协议的讨论，在加上俄罗斯支持下的东部叛乱，使得人们在生活中原本微不足道的细微区别之上剑拔弩张，紧张不已。 但自去年10月的议会选举后，乌克兰已经开始振作起来。 俄罗斯的干预在一定程度上适得其反，反而加强了乌克兰对欧洲的向心力。 虽然乌克兰东部的投票结果可能与该国其余地区不同，但支持偏爱欧洲的选民依然会占绝大多数。 选民们也拒绝了更致命形式的民族主义，把右翼极端党派晾在了一边。 选举最终结果是组成了一个五党执政联盟。 虽然看似脆弱，但团结却相当紧密。 它的一些成员显示出令人担忧的民粹主义倾向，但对议会投票模式的分析表明，到目前为止，即使是在非常棘手的问题上联盟依然能够达成共识。 除此之外，政府把天然气关税（从原本荒谬的低水平）提高了450 % 。 各派之间斗争也一直相对温和。 在此基础之上，乌克兰的核心体制正在经历根本性的变化。 中央银行 — — 曾经是国内寡头的囊中物，通过提供汇率和流动性的内部信息以换取贿赂 — — 已经任命了一位致力于改革的行长，招募了一个更为专业的团队。 能源寡头乌克兰天然气公司过去一直是充斥非法交易的藏污纳垢之地，却在这一年多以来实现了看似不可能的任务：让乌克兰几乎摆脱了对俄罗斯天然气的依赖。 而或许乌克兰最重要的成就则是建立国家改革委员会。 原本是为了协调跨部门改革并监督其进程，如今委员会已成为讨论和确保政府各部门之间一致性的重要工具。 鉴于向议会体系的回归所产生的体制模糊状况，以及总统彼得·波罗申科（Petro Poroshenko）和总理阿尔谢尼·亚采纽克（Arseniy Yatsenyuk）在政府中一山难容二虎的形势，后者的作用尤为重要。 会议每三周举行一次，总统、总理和他的整个内阁都会出席，为大家提供了一个可以讨论和缓解紧张关系的平台。 在会议期间，委员会的特别项目管理办公室协助各部委策划和实施关键改革。 在欧洲复兴开发银行，乔治•索罗斯（George Soros）资助国际复兴基金会以及瑞典等多国政府的双边援助下，办公室已经能够以市场认可的工资水平雇佣员工，从而提高政府管理的质量。 乌克兰政府也受益于私营部门领导人的专业知识。 主管国家改革委员会的总统办公厅副主任迪米特罗·什姆基夫（Dmytro Shymkiv）是原微软乌克兰分公司的首席执行官。 财���部长娜塔莉·雅雷斯科（Natalie Jaresko）和经济发展与贸易部长艾瓦拉斯·阿布罗马维丘斯（Aivaras Abromavicius）都曾是投资银行家（两人在加入政府时都不是乌克兰公民 ） 。 基础设施部长安德烈·皮沃瓦尔斯基（Andriy Pivovarsky）也是前投资银行家，曾任全国最大的控股公司之一Continium集团的CEO。 他们每一位都为推动改革议程向前发展发挥了关键作用，也在为比从前少得多的工资在工作。 有些人甚至自己花钱来雇佣员工。 同时，政府部长和总统办公厅的宏伟议程由一个充满活力的民间社会来密切监察着。 正如索罗斯指出的那样，乌克兰可能有着全欧最活跃的公民社会。 该国其中一个最有趣的新企业是VoxUkraine，一个由尤里·哥罗尼申科（Yuriy Gorodnichenko）和蒂莫西·米洛万诺夫（Timofiy Mylovanov）两位在美乌克兰经济学教授建立的博客平台。 他们倡导实施现代循证型决策，不断提出新的、有建设性的方式来挑战政府及其政策设想。 尽管取得了这些进步，形势依然对乌克兰不利。 政府同时在参与至少两场战争 — — 在试图抵御敌对东部邻国的同时还要对抗根深蒂固的寡头政治。 更麻烦的问题 — — 以经济急剧下滑的形式呈现 — — 则是政府无法承受的。 但改革的红利也是极大的。 自1992年独立以来，乌克兰第一次有了一个明确的方向和一个能够支持改革的政府。 有迹象表明，在某种程度上由于寡头之间的内部冲突，他们对国家的钳制开始有放松迹象。 欧盟和美国正努力帮助乌克兰解决与俄罗斯的冲突。 因此乌克兰的私人债权人现在必须认识到国家的经济和政治形势，接受债券减值。 否则无论是乌克兰经济 — — 还是政治体制 — — 都无法承受其他的方案。"

            "Could Ultra-Low Interest Rates Be Contractionary? CHICAGO – The real (inflation-adjusted) yield on ten-year US treasuries is currently zero, and has been extremely low for most of the past eight years. Outside of the United States, meanwhile, 40% of investment-grade bonds have negative nominal yields. And most recently, the European Central Bank further reduced its deposit rate to -0.5% as part of a new package of economic stimulus measures for the eurozone. Low interest rates have traditionally been viewed as positive for economic growth. But our recent research suggests that this may not be the case. Instead, extremely low interest rates may lead to slower growth by increasing market concentration. If this argument is correct, it implies that reducing interest rates further will not save the global economy from stagnation. The traditional view holds that when long-term rates fall, the net present value of future cash flows increases, making it more attractive for firms to invest in productivity-enhancing technologies. Low interest rates therefore have an expansionary effect on the economy through stronger productivity growth. But if low interest rates also have an opposite strategic effect, they reduce the incentive for firms to invest in boosting productivity. Moreover, as long-term real rates approach zero, this strategic contractionary effect dominates. So, in today’s low-interest-rate environment, a further decline in rates will most probably slow the economy by reducing productivity growth. This strategic effect works through industry competition. Although lower interest rates encourage all firms in a sector to invest more, the incentive to do so is greater for market leaders than for followers. As a result, industries become more monopolistic over time as long-term rates fall. Our research indicates that an industry leader and follower interact strategically in the sense that each carefully considers the other’s investment policy when deciding on its own. In particular, because industry leaders respond more strongly to a decline in the interest rate, followers become discouraged and stop investing as leaders get too far ahead. And because leaders then face no serious competitive threat, they too ultimately stop investing and become “lazy monopolists.” Perhaps the best analogy is with two runners engaged in a perpetual race around a track. The runner who finishes each lap in the lead earns a prize. And it is the present discounted value of these potential prizes that encourages the runners to improve their position. Now, suppose that sometime during the race, the interest rate used to discount future prizes falls. Both runners would then want to run faster because future prizes are worth more today. This is the traditional economic effect. But the incentive to run faster is greater for the runner in the lead, because she is closer to the prizes and hence more likely to get them. The lead runner therefore increases her pace by more than the follower, who becomes discouraged because she is now less likely to catch up. If the discouragement effect is large enough, then the follower simply gives up. Once that happens, the leader also slows down, as she no longer faces a competitive threat. And our research suggests that this strategic discouragement effect will dominate as the interest rate used to discount the value of the prizes approaches zero. In a real-world economy, the strategic effect is likely to be even stronger, because industry leaders and followers do not face the same interest rate in practice. Followers typically pay a spread over the interest rate paid by market leaders – and this spread tends to persist as interest rates fall. A cost-of-funding advantage like this for industry leaders would further strengthen the strategic contractionary impact of low interest rates. This contractionary effect helps to explain a number of important global economic patterns. First, the decline in interest rates that began in the early 1980s has been associated with growing market concentration, rising corporate profits, weaker business dynamism, and declining productivity growth. All are consistent with our model. Moreover, the timing of the aggregate trends also matches the model: the data show an increase in market concentration and profitability from the 1980s through 2000, followed by a slowdown in productivity growth starting in 2005. Second, the model makes some unique empirical predictions that we test against the data. For example, a stock portfolio that is long on industry leaders and short on industry followers generates positive returns when interest rates fall. More important, this effect becomes even stronger when the rate is low to begin with. This, too, is consistent with what the model predicts. The contractionary effect of ultra-low interest rates has important implications for the global economy. Our analysis suggests that with interest rates already extremely low, a further decline will have a negative economic impact via increased market concentration and lower productivity growth. So, far from saving the global economy, lower interest rates may cause it more pain.",
            "超低汇率会紧缩吗？ 芝加哥 — — 目前，十年期美国国债的实际（通货膨胀调整后）收益率为零，并且在过去八年的大部分时间内一直处于极低水平。 与此同时，在世界其他各地，40％的投资级债券的名义收益率呈现负态。 近期，作为欧元区新一揽子经济刺激措施的一部分，欧洲央行进一步将存款利率降至-0.5 ％ 。 从传统意义上讲，低利率通常被视为经济增长的有利因素。 但基于我方的近期研究表明，真实情况或许并非如此。 相反，在呈现极低态势时，利率或将通过强化市场集中度来减缓增长。 如果该论点正确，便意味着进一步降低利率将不会拯救全球经济的停滞。 传统观点认为：当长期利率下降时，未来现金流的净现值将会增加，这会吸引企业更多的投资于提高生产力的技术。 因此，通过更为强劲的生产率增长，低利率会对经济产生扩张性影响。 然而，如果低利率也具有相反的策略效应，则其会降低企业投资提高生产率的动力。 此外，伴随着长期实际利率趋近于零，这种策略性的收缩效应占据了主导地位。 因此，在当前低利率的大环境中，利率的进一步下调将极有可能通过降低生产率增长的形式来减缓经济增长。 这种策略效应通过行业竞争来实现。 尽管较低的利率会刺激某一行业的所有公司进行更多的投资，但这样的动机，市场领先者要大于追随者。 因此，随着长期利率下降，行业随着时间的推移变得更加垄断。 我方的研究表明，行业的领先者与追随者在战略上相辅相成，因为在做出自我决策时，每一方都会仔细分析对方的投资政策。 尤其是在利率下降时，由于行业领先者对其反应更为强烈：因此，当领先者与自身渐行渐远时，追随者便会呈现气馁之势，并停止投资。 同时，由于领先者彼时并未面临严峻的竞争威胁，因此该群体最终也会停止投资，并转变为“惰性十足的垄断者 ” 。 或许，以下这个比方最为恰当：即两名参赛者在一直在赛道上进行永无休止的竞争。 当每跑完成一圈时，领先的选手将会赢得奖金。 同时，正是因为此类潜在奖金的“贴现价值 ” ， 激励着选手们不断改变着自己在比赛中的位置。 现在，假设在比赛期间的时候，用于贴现未来奖金的利率下降。 然后，两位选手都希望跑得更快，因为今天贴现的奖品价值更高。 这是传统的经济效应。 但是领跑者有更大的动力去跑得更快，因为她更接近奖品，因此更有可能获得它。 因此，领跑者加快步伐，不断拉大与跟随者（步频较慢）间的距离，后者从而觉得追赶无望而变得气馁沮丧。 如果其沮丧感达到一定程度，那么追随者便会退出竞争。 一旦发生此类情况，领跑者便开始放慢速度，因为他们不再面临竞争的威胁。 我们的研究表明，这种策略性劝阻效应将占主导地位，因为用于贴现奖金价值的利率接近于零。 因此，我方的研究表明：随着充当“贴现奖金”价值的利率逐渐趋近于零，这种策略上的抑制效应将占据主导地位。 而在现实世界的经济中，策略效应的作用或许更为深远，因为事实上行业领先者与追随者并不会面临利率相同的情况。 后者所支付的利差，甚至高于前者所支付的利率 — — 同时，随着利率下调，这种息差往往会持续下去。 对行业领先者而言，这种融资成本优势将进一步增强低利率的策略性收缩的影响。 这种紧缩效应有助于解释一些重要的全球经济模式。 首先，始于上世纪80年代初的利率下降，与市场集中度不断上升、企业利润不断上升、商业活力减退，以及生产率增长的不断下降存在关联：这些均符合我们的模型。 此外，总体趋势出现的时间也与模型相符：数据显示，自上世纪80年代至2000年间，市场集中度与利润率均有所上升，随后从2005年开始，生产率的增长开始放缓。 其次，该模型进行了一些独特的经验性预测，在此过程中，我方对数据进行了测试。 例如，当利率下降时，例如，当利率下降时，长期依赖行业领先者而短期依赖行业追随者的股票组合会产生正回报。 更为重要的是：当利率一开始便处于低位时，这种效应会变得更强劲。 这也与模型的预测趋于一致。 此外，超低利率的紧缩效应对全球经济具有重要意义。 我方的分析表明：在利率已经处于极低点的情况时，通过提高市场集中度和降低生产率增长，利率会进一步下降，这将对经济产生负面影响。 因此，低利率非但不能拯救全球经济，反而可能会带来更大的阵痛。"

            "Why Universal Basic Income Is a Bad Idea BOSTON – Owing to the inadequacy of the social safety net in the United States and other developed countries, proposals for a universal basic income (UBI) are gaining in popularity. The gap between the rich and everyone else has expanded significantly in recent years, and many fear that automation and globalization will widen it further. To be sure, if the only choice is between mass impoverishment and a UBI, a UBI is preferable. Such a program would allow people to spend their money on whatever they value most. It would create a broad sense of ownership and a new constituency to shake up the system of big-money politics. Studies of conditional cash-transfer programs in developing economies have found that such policies can empower women and other marginalized groups. But UBI is a flawed idea, not least because it would be prohibitively expensive unless accompanied by deep cuts to the rest of the safety net. In the US (population: 327 million), a UBI of just $1,000 per month would cost around $4 trillion per year, which is close to the entire federal budget in 2018. Without major cost savings, US federal tax revenue would have to be doubled, which would impose massive distortionary costs on the economy. And, no, a permanent UBI could not be financed with government debt or newly printed currency. Sacrificing all other social programs for the sake of a UBI is a terrible idea. Such programs exist to address specific problems, such as the vulnerability of the elderly, children, and disabled people. Imagine living in a society where children still go hungry, and where those with severe health conditions are deprived of adequate care, because all the tax revenue has gone to sending monthly checks to every citizen, millionaires and billionaires included. Though UBI makes for a good slogan, it is a poorly designed policy. Basic economic theory implies that taxes on income are distortionary inasmuch as they discourage work and investment. Moreover, governments should avoid transfers to the same people from whom they collect revenue, but that is precisely what a UBI would do. In the US, for example, around three-quarters of households pay at least some federal income or payroll taxes, and an even greater share pays state taxes. Besides, a more sensible policy is already on offer: a negative income tax, or what is sometimes called “guaranteed basic income.” Rather than giving everyone $1,000 per month, a guaranteed-income program would offer transfers only to individuals whose monthly income is below $1,000, thereby coming in at a mere fraction of a UBI’s cost. UBI advocates would argue that non-universal transfer programs are less attractive because voters will not embrace them as enthusiastically. But this criticism is unfounded. Guaranteed basic income is just as universal as national health insurance, which does not dispense monthly payments to everyone, but rather benefits anyone who has incurred medical costs. The same is true of programs that unconditionally guarantee support for basic needs, such as food for the hungry and unemployment insurance for the jobless. Such policies are widely popular in the countries that have them. Finally, much of the enthusiasm for UBI is based on a misreading of employment trends in advanced economies. Contrary to popular belief, there is no evidence that work as we know it will disappear anytime soon. Automation and globalization are indeed restructuring work, eliminating certain types of jobs and increasing inequality. But rather than build a system where a large fraction of the population receives handouts, we should be adopting measures to encourage the creation of “middle-class” jobs with good pay, while strengthening our ailing social safety net. UBI does none of this. In the US, the top policy goals should be universal health care, more generous unemployment benefits, better-designed retraining programs, and an expanded earned income tax credit (EITC). The EITC already functions like a guaranteed basic income for low-wage workers, costs far less than a UBI, and directly encourages work. On the business side, reducing the indirect costs and payroll taxes that employers pay for hiring workers would spur job creation, also at a pittance of the cost of a UBI. With higher minimum wages to prevent employers from free riding on workers’ tax credits, an expanded EITC and reduced payroll taxes would go a long way toward creating worthwhile jobs at all levels of the income distribution. Equally important, these solutions leverage democratic politics. The same cannot be said for a UBI, which is parachuted from above as a way of placating the discontented masses. It neither empowers nor even consults the people it aims to help. (Do workers who have lost their middle-class jobs want government transfers or an opportunity to get another job?) As such, UBI proposals have all the hallmarks of the “bread and circuses” used by the Roman and Byzantine Empires – handouts to defuse discontent and mollify the masses, rather than providing them with economic opportunities and political agency. By contrast, the modern social welfare state that has served developed countries so well was not handed down by tycoons and politicians. It aimed to provide both social insurance and opportunities to people. And it was the result of democratic politics. Ordinary people made demands, complained, protested, and got involved in policymaking, and the political system responded. The founding document of the British welfare state, the World War II-era Beveridge Report, was as much a response to political demands as to economic hardship. It sought to protect the disadvantaged and create opportunities, while encouraging civic engagement. Many current social problems are rooted in our neglect of the democratic process. The solution isn’t to dribble out enough crumbs to keep people at home, distracted, and otherwise pacified. Rather, we need to rejuvenate democratic politics, boost civic involvement, and seek collective solutions. Only with a mobilized, politically active society can we build the institutions we need for shared prosperity in the future, while protecting the most disadvantaged among us.",
            "为什么全民基本收入是个坏主意 发自波士顿 — — 由于美国和其他发达国家的社会安全网多有不足，以至于关于全民基本收入（universal basic income）的提案日益得到民众欢迎。 近年来富人与普通人之间的差距已大大扩大，而许多人担心自动化和全球化还将加剧这一趋势。 毫无疑问，如果只能在大规模贫困和全民基本收入之间二选一，那么全民基本收入显然是必选。 该项目可以让人们把钱花在他们最为珍视的东西上。 它将创造一种广泛的所有权意识和一个足以动摇金钱政治体系的新选区体制。 而多项针对发展中经济体有条件现金转移支付项目的研究也发现这些政策可以赋权于妇女和其他边缘群体。 但全民基本收入是个有缺陷的理念，尤其是除非伴随着对安全网其他部分的大幅削减，否则它将昂贵得让各方无力承受。 在拥有3.27亿人口的美国，每月仅支付1000美元的全民基本收入每年就将花费大约4万亿美元，几乎相当于2018年的整个联邦预算。 如果不砍掉其他大笔支出，就必须让美国联邦税收翻一番 — — 这将给经济带来巨大的扭曲成本。 而且一项永久性的全民基本收入是无法用政府债券或新印刷货币来融资支付的。 为实现全民基本收入而牺牲所有其他社会项目是一个可怕的想法。 这些项目的存在都是为了解决某些具体问题，诸如老年人，儿童和残疾人的社会脆弱性问题。 试想一下在一个仍有儿童忍饥挨饿的社会中，有些健康状况极端不佳的人被剥夺了足够的护理，只是为了把所有税收都用于每月给每位公民（包括那些坐拥万贯家财的富翁们）发钱。 虽然全民基本收入是一个很好的口号，但作为一项政策却设计得很糟糕。 基本经济理论告诉我们对收入征税是扭曲性的，因为它们会抑制工作和投资。 此外政府也避免转移支付到同一个被征税人身上，但这正是全民基本收入的基本内容。 比如美国约有3/4的家庭至少支付过某些联邦所得或工资税，还有更多家庭缴交了州税。 此外也有人提出了一个更为明智的政策：负所得税，有时被称为“保证性基本收入 ” 。 与其每人每月发1000美元，保证性收入计划只会向月收入低于1000美元的个人提供转移支付，其支出也因此仅相当于全民基本收入成本的一小部分。 那些全民基本收入的倡导者会辩解说非全民转移支付计划的吸引力较小，因为选民接受它们的积极性不会太高。 但这种批评是没有根据的。 保证性基本收入可以与国民健康保险一样具备普遍性 — — 国民健康保险不会每月向每个人打款，但会让任何需要支付医疗费用的人受益。 那些无条件保证支持基本需求的项目也是如此，例如给与饥饿人口的食物和失业保险。 这些政策都在各个国家内部广受欢迎。 最后，大部分对全民基本收入的热情都是基于一种对发达经济体就业趋势的误读。 与流行观点相反，没有证据表明我们眼下所见的工作很快就会消失。 自动化和全球化确实是在对工作进行重组，消灭了某些类型的工作并增大了不平等状况。 但我们的对此应该是采取措施鼓励创造高薪酬的“中产阶级”工作，同时强化问题重重的社会安全网，而不是建立一个向大部分人口发钱的制度。 然而上述措施都是全民基本收入所未曾涉及的。 在美国，首要政策目标应该是全民医疗保健，更慷慨的失业救济金，设计更合理的再培训计划以及扩大所得税抵免。 所得税抵免的功能就像是低工资工人的基本收入保障，不但成本远低于全民基本收入，还能直接鼓励人们工作。 在商业界层面，减少雇主为雇用员工支付的间接成本和工资税可以刺激创造就业机会，同时降低全民基本收入的成本。 通过提高最低工资以防雇主利用员工的税收抵免牟利，所得税抵免的扩大以及工资税的降低都将大大有助于在各级收入分配中创造有价值的工作。 而同样重要的一点在于这些解决方案能提升民主政治。 而全民基本收入则并非如此，因为它是作为一种安抚不满群众的手段而从上到下推行的，不赋权（甚至不会咨询）那些它旨在帮助的人。 （那些失去中产阶级工作的劳动者想要的究竟是政府转移支付还是另一份工作？ ）因此，全民基本收入提案具有罗马和拜占庭帝国所使用的“面包和马戏团”的所有标志 — — 用施舍来化解不满和安抚群众，而不是为他们提供经济机会和政治代表。 相比之下，令发达国家获益良多的现代社会福利国家制度并未被大亨和政治家传承下来。 它旨在为人们提供社会保险和机会，同时也是民主政治的结果。 普通民众提出要求，抱怨，抗议并参与政策制定，而政治制度对此作出回应。 英国福利国家的奠基性文件，二战时期的《贝弗里奇报告 》 ， 既是对经济困难，也是对政治要求的回应。 它力求保护弱势群体并创造机会，同时鼓励公民参与。 当前许多社会问题的根源在于我们忽视了民主进程。 解决办法不是拿出足够的小恩小惠来让人们留在家中，分散其注意力，并以其他方式安抚。 相反，我们需要振兴民主政治，促进公民参与并寻求集体解决方案。 只有凭借一个民众动员起来且政治活跃的社会，我们才能建立未来实现共同繁荣所需的体制，同时保护我们中间的最弱势群体。"

            "When Inflation Doves Cry PITTSBURGH – The Wall Street Journal recently ran a front-page article reporting that the monetary-policy “doves,” who had forecast low inflation in the United States, have gotten the better of the “hawks,” who argued that the Fed’s monthly purchases of long-term securities, or so-called quantitative easing (QE), would unleash faster price growth. The report was correct but misleading, for it failed to mention why there is so little inflation in the US today. Were the doves right, or just lucky? The US Federal Reserve Board has pumped out trillions of dollars of reserves, but never have so many reserves produced so little monetary growth. Neither the hawks nor the doves (nor anyone else) expected that. Monetarists insist that economies experience inflation when money-supply growth persistently exceeds output growth. That has not happened yet, so inflation has been postponed. Instead of rejecting monetary theory and history, the army of Wall Street soothsayers should look beyond the Fed’s press releases and ask themselves: Does it make sense to throw out centuries of experience? Are we really so confident that the Fed has found a new way? The Fed has printed new bank reserves with reckless abandon. But almost all of the reserves sit idle on commercial banks’ balance sheets. For the 12 months ending in July, the St. Louis Fed reports that bank reserves rose 31%. During the same period, a commonly used measure of monetary growth, M2, increased by only 6.8%. No sound monetarist thinks those numbers predict current inflation. Indeed, almost all the reserves added in the second and third rounds of QE, more than 95%, are sitting in excess reserves, neither lent nor borrowed and never used to increase money in circulation. The Fed pays the banks 0.25% to keep them idle. With $2 trillion in excess reserves, and the prospect of as much as $85 billion added each month, banks receive $5 billion a year, and rising, without taking any risk. For the bankers, that’s a bonanza, paid from monies that the Fed would normally pay to the US Treasury. And, adding insult to injury, about half the payment goes to branches of foreign banks. In normal times, there are valid reasons for paying interest on excess reserves. Currently, however, it is downright counter-productive. Bank loans have started to increase, but small borrowers, new borrowers, and start-up companies are regularly refused. Current low interest rates do not cover the risk that banks would take. To be sure, they could raise the rate for new and small borrowers; but, in the current political climate, they would stand accused of stifling economic recovery if they did. The new Consumer Financial Protection Board is also a deterrent, as banks consider it safer to lend to the government, large corporations, and giant real-estate speculators. The banks can report record profits without much risk, rebuild capital, and pay dividends and bonuses. And the Fed can congratulate itself on the mostly unobserved way that the large banks have used taxpayers’ money. Instead of continuing along this futile path, the Fed should end its open-ended QE3 now. It should stop paying interest on excess reserves until the US economy returns to a more normal footing. Most important, it should announce a strategy for eliminating the massive volume of such reserves. I am puzzled, and frankly appalled, by the Fed’s failure to explain how it will restore its balance sheet to a non-inflationary level. The announcements to date simply increase uncertainty without telling the public anything useful. Selling $2 trillion of reserves will take years. It must do more than repeat that the Fed can raise interest rates paid on reserves to encourage banks to hold them. It will take a clearly stated, widely understood strategy – the kind that Paul Volcker introduced in 1979-1982 – to complete the job. Should the end of QE come in September, December, or later? Does it matter? Historically, the Fed has typically been slow to respond to inflation. Waiting until inflation is here, as some propose, is the usual way. But that merely fuels inflation expectations and makes the task more painful. And how high will the Fed push up interest rates? Once rates get to 5% or 6%, assuming inflation remains dormant, the Fed can expect a backlash from Congress, the administration, unions, homebuilders, and others. When contemplating the consequences of this, remember that 40% of US government debt comes due within two years. Rolling it over at higher rates of 4% or 5% would add more than $100 billion to the budget deficit. And that is just the first two years. The budget cost increases every year, as more of the debt rolls over – and that does not include agency debt and the large increase in the current-account deficit to pay China, Japan, and other foreign holders of US debt. Those who believe that inflation will remain low should look more thoroughly and think more clearly. There are plenty of good textbooks that explain what too many policymakers and financial-market participants would rather forget.",
            "当通胀鸽派得势 匹兹堡 — 《 华尔街日报》最近刊登了一篇头版文章报道，说预测美国通胀将保持低位的货币政策“鸽派”已经压倒了认为美联储每月购买长期证券的计划，即所谓的量化宽松（QE）将加速物价上涨的“鹰派 ” 。 报道说的没错，但有误导之嫌，因为它没有提及为何现今美国通胀如此之低。 是鸽派对了，还是仅仅因为幸运？ 美联储董事会抛出了数万亿美元的准备金，但如此之多的准备金只造成如此至少的货币增长，这是从未有过的事情。 鹰派和鸽派（和任何其他人）都没有料到会如此。 货币主义者坚持认为，当货币供给持续高于产出增长时，经济会经历通胀。 但这并没有发生，因此通胀一直起不来。 华尔街预言家不应该拒绝接受货币理论和历史，而应该让目光超越美联储新闻稿，扪心自问：否定几百年的经验有意义吗？ 我们真的这么有信心，认为美联储已经找到了新道路？ 美联储毫无忌惮地大手笔印着新银行准备金。 但这些准备金几乎全部闲置在商业银行的资产负债表上。 在截至7月的12个月中，圣路易斯联邦储备银行报告其银行准备金增加了31 % 。 同一时期，常用货币增长指标M2只增加了6.8 % 。 没有哪位严谨的货币主义者会认为这些数字意味着当前通胀。 事实上，几乎所有在第二轮和第三轮QE期间增加的准备金（超过95 % ） 以超额准备金的形式存在着，既没有借贷，也没有用于增加流通中货币。 美联储为了这些闲置资金向银行支付0.25%的利息。 超额准备金高达2万亿美元，而且预计将以每个月850亿美元的速度增加，银行将因此每年获得50亿美元（而且会越来越多 ） ， 还不用承担任何风险。 对银行家来说，这简直是天降馅饼，这笔钱通常是美联储付给美国财政部的。 此外，雪上加霜的是，一半的支付额流入了外国银行的分支机构。 在正常时期，可以找到充分的理由论证应该向超额准备金支付利息。 但是，目前这么做不利于生产。 银行贷款已开始增加，但小型借款人、新借款人和创业公司总是吃闭门羹。 当前的低利率不能覆盖银行所冒的风险。 诚然，它们可以针对新借款人和小借款人提高利息；但是，在当前的政治气候下，这么做会让它们受到千夫所指，认为它们妨碍复苏。 新的消费者金融保护委员会也成了妨碍因素，因为银行认为借钱给政府、大公司和大型房地产投机商更加安全。 银行可以报告利润，有不同承担高风险；可以冲减资本；可以支付股票红利和奖金。 而美联储也可以暗自庆幸，大银行用难以看到的方式用了纳税人的钱。 美联储不应该继续坚持这一徒劳无益的政策，而应该马上结束无限制QE3。 美联储应该停止向超额准备金支付利息，直到美国经济站稳脚跟。 最重要的是，美联储应该宣布消灭如此巨量准备金的战略。 我很困惑，坦白说是惊骇，美联储一直没有解释它将如何让其资产负债表恢复到无通胀水平。 目前所宣布的政策只能增加不确定性，而没有告诉公众任何有用的信息。 拍卖2万亿准备金要花上多年时间。 除了重申美联储可能增加准备金利率以鼓励银行持有它们之外，美联储还需要做些另外的事。 为此，美联储必须给出明确的、被广泛理解的战略，就像1979—1982年保罗·沃克尔（Paul Volcker）做的那样。 QE的结束会在9月、12月还是更晚发生？ 这重要吗？ 从历史上看，美联储对通胀的反应总是慢半拍。 正如一些人所指出的，坐等通胀出现是美联储的惯常做法。 但这只能助长通胀预期，让任务更加艰巨。 美联储会把利率提高到何种高度？ 如果���率达到5%或6 % ， 假设通胀仍然低迷，那么美联储将受到国会、政府、工会、业主和其他人的口诛笔伐。 在思考这些后果时，必须牢记40%的美国政府债务将于两年内到期。 以更高的利率 — — 4%或5 % — —展期将导致预算赤字增加1000多亿美元。 而这仅仅是最初两年。 随着更多的债务展期，预算成本将逐年太高 — — 这还不算政府机构债务和经常项目赤字的增加以支付中国、日本和其他美国债务外国债权人。 认为通胀将保持低迷者应该看得更通透一些，想得更明了一些。 有很多决策者和金融市场参与者忘记的东西原原本本地躺在出色的教科书中。"

            "Impeachment’s Partisan Doom WASHINGTON, DC – The US Senate’s failure to convict Donald Trump for instigating the January 6 riot in the Capitol, for which the House of Representatives had impeached him, leaves the question of whether the US Congress has any effective means of holding a president to account for acts against the Constitution. The nation’s Founders had sought to prevent a president from enhancing his own powers to the point of becoming, in effect, a king. Under Trump, America’s constitutional system had a dagger pointed to its heart: a president who refused to recognize that he had lost an election and was willing to use a mob to physically attack a supposedly co-equal branch. America’s Founders made conviction by the Senate, which brings removal from office, for an impeachable offense – which need not be a statutory crime – very difficult by requiring a two-thirds vote. A president, they believed, should not be removed from office as a result of a national mood swing. No president has been removed from office through impeachment by the House followed by conviction by the Senate – Richard Nixon resigned because he was told by leading congressional Republicans that he had lost sufficient support in the Senate to stay in office. Essentially, to remove a president from office is to nullify the vote of the people. Moreover, that person is likely to retain a hold on at least a segment of his party. Indeed, until not long ago as US history goes, politicians were loath to even bring up the subject of impeachment. The Nixon near-impeachment and removal from office in 1973-74 was the historical turning point. When there arose the first serious talk of impeaching Nixon after he fired a series of attorneys general in order to remove the special prosecutor, Archibald Cox, it was widely considered an awesome, even terrifying, proposition. This was the first time the subject had seriously come up since President Andrew Johnson’s near-removal in 1868. Since Nixon, the idea of employing such a remedy has arisen far more frequently. The fundamental problem with the impeachment process as a method for holding a president accountable is that the relevant clause in the Constitution, written in 1787, was designed for a different political landscape than what the US has had for most of its history. At the time, the nation did not have actual political parties. The Founders, indeed, feared “factions,” or parties, which developed as the debate over the proper role of the federal government grew. In his Farewell Address, George Washington warned of “the baneful effects of the spirit of party.” This spirit, Washington warned, had “its root in the strongest passions of the human mind.” In addition, Federalist Paper No. 10, written by James Madison, was an indication that the Constitution was written in the spirit of opposition to political parties. One reason to doubt the efficacy of impeachment and conviction as an instrument for removing (at least a Republican) president is that since each state has two senators, small states, whose populations tend to be rural and conservative, have excessive power for their relative size. But the great difference between the impeachment processes pertaining to Nixon, on which there was a bipartisan consensus, and those pertaining to Trump stems mainly from profound changes in the Republican party. The Republicans of Nixon’s day were far more centrist and less vindictive than today’s Trumpist party. While Nixon retained the loyalty of Republican party members, people were not threatened with expulsion for seeking his removal from office. It was fear of some future opposition that led Republican nobs to go to the White House to tell him that he did not have the political support in the House or the Senate to remain in office – so that they would not have to cast votes on the matter. In announcing that she would vote to impeach Trump, Representative Liz Cheney, a true conservative (and daughter of former vice president Dick Cheney), said: “there has never been a greater betrayal by a President of the United States of his office and his oath to the Constitution.” Cheney spurned Trump’s weeks-long stoking up of the radical-right by claiming, falsely, that the election had been stolen from him, and then urging a mob to go to the Capitol precisely while the Electoral College ballots were being counted, and “fight like hell.” In response, Cheney was censured by the Wyoming Republican party and her position as third in line of the House Republicans was challenged in the party caucus. Jamie Raskin, the lead House prosecutor, alongside his eight colleagues, did a masterly job in making the case against Trump. Raskin is also a constitutional law professor, so when I spoke to him late Saturday following the close of the Senate proceeding, I asked if, given the very different circumstances between the time of the drafting of the Constitution and now, and given the outsized power of small states in the Senate, he ever expected there to be a two-thirds vote for convicting Trump. Raskin replied: “I always thought there was a better chance of our getting 100 votes than 67. I thought that when we presented our case, the bottom would fall out from Trump’s side.” Raskin continued: “But apparently there are no depths too low for some of our GOP colleagues to sink. We’ve arrived at a point in history where a once-great party can behave like a cult. Facts, logic, and the rule of law have dropped out of the equation.” Raskin attributed this to the fact that “their leader is exercising psychological, financial, and political control over his followers. He has assembled a war chest that strikes fear among Republicans.” Raskin concluded by saying that “the political party system has taken over the congressional system. It’s not two branches that govern congress now, but two parties, and one of them has surrendered reason and common sense.” Trump may have escaped being convicted by Congress for instigating a murderous mob attack on America’s Capitol, yet it seems clear that he will be held accountable for it in history.",
            "弹劾的党派诅咒 华盛顿—美国参议院没能就煽动1月6日国会暴动的行为对特朗普定罪（众议院提起了弹劾案 ） ， 这让人质疑美国国会是否有有效手段问责美国总统的违宪行为。 美国开国元勋试图防止总统扩大自己的权力，成为事实上的君主。 特朗普执政期间，美国宪政体系受到了致命一击：总统拒绝承认败选，准备动用暴徒对所谓的平等机构发动物理进攻。 美国开国元勋的安排让参议院 — — 它有权罢免总统 — — 裁定弹劾（未必需要是法定罪行）非常困难，需要三分之二多数赞成。 他们认为，总统不应该因为国民情绪的波动而被罢免。 从未有总统通过众议院发起、参议院定罪而被弹劾 — — 尼克松辞职了，因为他被国会共和党大佬们告知他在参议院没有足够的支持继续当总统。 本质上，罢免总统等于否定了人民的选票。 此外，被罢免的总统可能仍能获得所在政党至少一部分人的支持。 事实上，美国历史上的政客根本就很少愿意提到弹劾这一主题。 尼克松在1973-74年几乎遭到弹劾和罢免，这是一个历史转折点。 在尼克松为了驱逐特别检察官阿齐博尔德·考克斯（Archibald Cox）而解雇了一连串司法部长后，人们开始认真讨论弹劾他的问题，弹劾被广泛认为是可怕甚至令人恐怖的方案。 这是1868年约翰逊总统几乎遭到罢免之后这一话题第一次被认真提出。 尼克松之后，启用这一补救措施的想法出现的更为频繁了。 弹劾流程作为问责总统的方法的基本问题在于在写于1787年的宪法相关条款，其针对的政治局面于美国历史上大部分时间内的政治局面截然不同。 当时，美国不存在实际上的政党。 开国元勋们确实担心 “派系 ” ， 或党派，它们随着关于联邦政府的恰当角色的争论愈演愈烈而产生。 华盛顿在其告别演说中警告 “党派精神的有害影响 ” 。 这一精神，华盛顿警告 ， “ 根源在于人类思维中最强大的热情 。 ” 此外，詹姆斯·麦迪逊所写的《联邦党人文集第10篇 》 （ Federalist Paper No. 10）表明，宪法便是以反对政党的精神写就。 质疑弹劾及定罪作为罢免（至少一位共和党）总统的工具的效力的理由之一是，每个州都有两名参议员，人口以农民和保守派为主的小州会拥有相对其规模的过分权力。 但适用于尼克松的弹劾程序（存在广泛的跨党派共识）和适用于特朗普的弹劾程序截然不同，差异主要源于共和党所发生的重大变化。 尼克松时期的共和党比今天的特朗普主义共和党更加偏中间派，不那么睚眦必报。 尼克松在共和党中间仍有忠诚追随者，但人们并没有因为寻求罢免他而受到驱逐威胁。 共和党大佬们害怕未来遇到反对，才来到白宫告诉尼克松他已经失去继续当总统所需要的众议院和参议院的政治支持 — — 因此他们不必在这个问题上投票。 正宗保守派、前副总统迪克·切尼（Dick Cheney）之女、众议员丽兹·切尼（Liz Cheney）在宣布将支持弹劾特朗普时说 ： “ 从未有美国总统如此背叛了他的职责和宪法宣誓 。 ” 切尼鄙夷特朗普几周以来对极端右翼的煽动，捏造所谓的选举被偷走，敦促暴徒在选举人团唱票时占领国会，并“战斗到底 ” 。 作为回应，切尼受到了怀俄明州共和党的严厉谴责，她在众议院共和党中第三的排位也在党会中受到挑战。 众议院主控人杰米·拉斯金（Jamie Raskin）以及他的八位同事非常出色地完成了起诉特朗普的工作。 拉斯金也是一位宪法学教授，因此，当我在周六晚参议院流程结束后与他对话时，我问，考虑到宪法起草时和现在的巨大的环境差异，以及小州在参议院中过大的权力，他是否期待能获得三分之二的赞成票定罪特朗普。 拉斯金回答说 ： “ 我一向认为，我们获得100票的希望大过获得67票。 我认为，当我们提出本案时，特朗普这一边将一败涂地 。 ” 拉斯金继续说 ： “ 但显然，我们的一些共和党同事不肯就范。 这是一个历史性时刻，一个伟大的党，做出了流氓一样的行为。 事实、逻辑和法治根本不再考虑范围内 。 ” 拉斯金将这归因于一个事实，即“他们的领导人在心理、财务和政治上控制了他的追随者。 他组建了一笔战争拨款，威逼共和党 。 ” 最后，拉斯金总结说 ， “ 政党制度已经取代了国会制度。 现在治理国会的不是两个分支，而是两个政党，其中之一已经不顾理性和常识 。 ” 因此，特朗普逃脱因煽动杀人暴徒攻击美国国会而被国会定罪，但显然，他将因此遭到历史的审判。"

            "America's Flawed State-Building Enterprise TEL AVIV – “Afghanistan was the ultimate nation-building mission,” former US President George W. Bush wrote in his 2010 memoir. “We had liberated the country from a primitive dictatorship, and we had a moral obligation to leave behind something better.” There is nothing surprising about this logic: colonial enterprises have always been described as “civilizing missions.” And, as in Afghanistan, they have consistently failed. In fact, the only way to build a nation-state is from the inside. To be sure, the United States has engaged in successful state-building. After World War II, it implemented the Marshall Plan in Western Europe. But this was more “re-building” than construction from scratch, and it was undertaken in countries with histories of state capacity, functioning market economies, and traditions of national cohesion. Moreover, the details of the reconstruction were left almost entirely to locals. In the wake of WWII, the US also pursued successful democratization. But, again, it wasn’t “exporting democracy” to countries with no such traditions. Rather, it was building on the latent values of the Weimar Republic in occupied Germany and Taishō democracy in Japan. This is very different from America’s more recent missions. After its Cold War victory, the US began to engage in liberal interventionism with great relish – and hubris. In a range of countries – including, in Africa alone, Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Somalia, and South Sudan – it launched protracted and expensive state-building initiatives that utterly ignored historical legacies and sociopolitical contexts. Today, these states remain highly fragile. Even when the US enlisted the help of United Nations professionals and experienced NGOs – which were willing to engage local stakeholders, not just the political elites – its efforts to build state institutions from scratch failed (it has at times managed to strengthen existing institutions). In Kosovo, a UN interim administration led an extensive state-building effort beginning in 1999. In 2016, Freedom House classified Kosovo as a “semi-consolidated authoritarian regime,” and in 2021 as a “partly free state.” Likewise, 26 years after the Dayton peace accords ended the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina and US-led state-building efforts began there, the country is classified as a “partly free state.” According to a recent UN report, “the multi-ethnic and diverse society that existed prior to the conflict has all but disappeared.” In Afghanistan, the failure of America’s state-building efforts could not be starker, with the US-backed government lasting just days after Western troops withdrew. But it was also predictable: Afghanistan has never had a state, in the Western sense of the term. Iraq – which the US invaded soon after Afghanistan, during the burst of liberal interventionism that followed the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 – did exist as a state before US troops arrived. But after 18 years of American occupation, it is anything but a unified multiethnic democracy where human rights and the rule of law are upheld. This is not to say that a country without a tradition of democratic governance or credible institutions is doomed never to develop them. Promoting “social cohesion” and “indigenous capacities,” as the professional literature advocates, is a commendable goal. But a country that is socially fragmented, lacks a tradition of political pluralism, and is situated in an unstable, non-democratic region is a fundamentally improbable candidate for democratization. In Afghanistan, for example, the US-backed government was an invertebrate political entity grafted onto a deeply sectarian society. This meant that state-building was tantamount to nation-building. And while Bush considered nation-building essential, the nature and scope of the task is far beyond the capacity of any external force. This is especially true under conditions of war. America’s state-building missions in Afghanistan and Iraq began with military invasions that claimed hundreds of thousands of local victims. As soon as locals began to perceive the US “war of liberation” as an occupation, anti-American sentiment soared. In 2005, only 17% of Afghans wanted the US to leave their country. By 2009, that figure had grown to 53%. In Iraq, meanwhile, a whopping 71% of the population wanted the US out within a year. These were not people who were going to embrace an American vision of their future. It did not help that Islamist forces – whether the Taliban or the Islamic State – proved so tenacious. With the withdrawal from Afghanistan, the US appears finally to be abandoning liberal interventionism. This reflects a broader shift in the global balance of power. After its Cold War victory, the US set about building a new world order based on “liberal values,” including respect for human rights, democratic governance, and free-market economics. It was an inherently unrealistic and ahistorical objective, but there was no other power – or model – that could challenge the American hegemon. China’s rise, together with the proliferation of illiberal regimes, has changed that. Ultimately, America’s state-building project in Afghanistan was a strategic failure, not a tactical one. Instead of engaging in state-building via a corrupt and unpopular puppet government in Kabul, while fighting an unwinnable war, the US should have reached an early settlement with the Taliban and left the country. The 2011 assassination of Osama bin Laden provided the ideal opportunity for such disengagement. Rather than slinking out of the country as a triumphant Taliban reclaimed power, the US could have declared a kind of victory – and perhaps retained far more leverage over a country where it now has none.",
            "美国满是缺陷的国家建设使命 特拉维夫—前美国总统小布什曾在其2010年回忆录中写道 ， “ 阿富汗可谓终级国家建设使命。 我们将这个国家从原始独裁统治下解放出来，因此对其负有道德义务留下更好的东西 。 ” 这样的逻辑并不令人意外：有人一直用“文明使命”来描绘殖民事业。 而且，就像在阿富汗一样，他们一直陷于失败。 事实上，从内部着手是建设民族国家的唯一途径。 可以肯定，美国参与国家建设已经有过成功的先例。 二战后，它在西欧推行了马歇尔计划。 但这更像是“重建”而非从零建起，而且实施重建的国家曾有过国家力量、市场经济和传统上的民族凝聚力。 此外，重建的细节几乎完全留给了当地势力。 二战结束后，美国同样追求成功的民主化。 但需要再次强调，它并未向不具备民主传统的国家“出口民主体制 ” 。 相反，美国重建的基础是被德国占领的魏玛共和国和日本大正民主的潜在价值。 这与美国近期的民族使命迥然相异。 冷战胜利后，美国开始兴致勃勃、并且狂妄自大地实行自由干预主义。 仅非洲大陆，美国就在布隆迪、 刚果民主共和国、索马里和南苏丹等一系列国家发起了旷日持久且代价高昂的国家建设行动，同时，却对历史遗产和社会政治背景完全无视。 今天，这些国家仍无法摆脱脆弱的境地。 即使在联合国专业人士和经验丰富的非政府机构协助下 — — 上述力量愿意接触当地利益相关人士，而不仅仅是政治精英 — — 美国从零开始、建设国家机构的努力同样陷入失败的境地（它有时成功强化了现有体制 ） 。 在科索沃，联合国临时政府从1999年就开始领导全面的国家建设工作。 而2016年，自由之家将科索沃列为“半巩固独裁政权 ” ， 并在2021年将其列为“部分自由国家 。 ” 同样，在代顿和平协议结束波斯尼亚-黑塞哥维那战争和由美国领导的国家建设工作启动26年后，科索沃被列为“部分自由国家 。 ” 据近期一份联合国报告显示 ， “ 冲突前曾经存在的多种族和多元化社会几乎已完全消失 。 ” 美国国家建设工作在阿富汗的失败再明显不过，美国支持的政府在西方军队撤出后短短几天就已经陷入崩溃。 但这种情况其实不难预料：西方意义上的国家在阿富汗其实从未存在过。 在2001年911恐怖袭击后自由干预主义大爆发期间，美国在入侵阿富汗不久后就入侵了伊拉克 — — 在美军抵达前，伊拉克确实作为一个国家存在过。 但在18年的美军占领后，伊拉克绝不是一个统一的多民族民主政体，那里的人权和法治也从未得到保护。 这并不是说不具备民主治理或可信机构的国家就命中注定永远不可能逐步建立上述机构。 促进“社会凝聚力”和“本土实力 ， ” 正如专业文献所倡导的那样，是一个值得称赞的目的。 但一个社会支离破碎、缺乏政治多元化传统，并且处在动荡、非民主地区的国家却根本不可能完成民主化任务。 例如，在阿富汗，由美国支持的政府是一个嫁接到根深蒂固的宗派社会的毫无骨气的政治实体。 这意味着国家建设与民族建设大概是一回事。 虽然布什认为民族建设至关重要，但这项任务的性质和范围却远远超出任何外部势力的能力。 战争条件下尤其如此。 在夺去数十万当地受害者性命的军事侵略战争后，美国在阿富汗和伊拉克的国家建设行动才刚刚开始。 一旦当地人开始将美国的“解放战争”视为一种占领，就会引发高涨的反美情绪。 2005年，希望美国人离开阿富汗的阿富汗人仅有17 % 。 但到2009年，这一数字已经增长到53 % 。 与此同时，在伊拉克，高达71%的人希望美军在一年内撤离。 这些人不可能接受美国对其未来的规划视野。 事实证明，塔利班或伊斯兰国等伊斯兰势力如此顽强也不是什么好事。 随着从阿富汗撤军，美国似乎终于开始放弃自由干预主义。 这反映了更大范围内全球实力平衡的转变。 冷战胜利后，美国开始建设基于“自由价值观 ， ” 包括尊重人权、民主治理和自由市场经济的全新世界秩序。 这是一个从本质上就不切实际而且不符合历史规律的目标，但当时还没有可以挑战美国霸权的其他势力 — — 或者模式。 中国的崛起，加之非自由政权的全面扩散，已经改变了这种局势。 归根结底，美国在阿富汗的国家建设计划失败具有战略而非战术性质。 与其联手喀布尔不得人心的腐败傀儡政府建设国家，同时陷入一场根本不可能取胜的战争，美国本应早日与塔利班达成和解，并离开阿富汗。 2001年刺杀奥萨马·本·拉登原本提供了理想的脱离接触的机会。 美国本来可以在某种程度上宣告胜利 — — 而不是在欣喜若狂的塔利班夺回权力时溜出该国 — — 或许对这个现在已失去全部影响力的国家也会保留更多的影响力。"

            "Send in the Clowns NEW YORK – When too many Italians voted late last month for either a louche and discredited business tycoon or a comedian, European stock markets plummeted. With no public trust in the political class, Italy might become ungovernable. But Italians are not alone. Rage against the political establishment has become a global phenomenon. Chinese bloggers, American Tea Party activists, British Europhobes, Egyptian Islamists, Dutch populists, Greek ultra-rightists, and Thai “red shirts” all have one thing in common: hatred of the status quo and contempt for their countries’ elites. We are living in an age of populism. The authority of conventional politicians and traditional media is slipping away fast. Populism can be a necessary corrective when political parties grow sclerotic, mass media become too complacent (or too close to power), and bureaucracies are unresponsive to popular needs. In a globalized world managed by bankers and technocrats, many people feel that they have no say in public affairs; they feel abandoned. Our national politicians, increasingly powerless to cope with serious crises, are suspected, often with good reason, of simply looking after their own interests. All we can do is vote the rascals out, sometimes by voting for candidates whom we would not take seriously in more normal times. Italian elites are not the only ones in need of being shaken up. But the problem with populism is that it is rarely benign. In the 1930’s, it resulted in violent movements led by dangerous men in uniform. Today’s populists are different. They do not, on the whole, advocate violence. Some preach that Muslims are destroying Western civilization. Others think that President Barack Obama is a kind of communist out to destroy America. Two types of contemporary populist, however, stand out: the ultra-rich business tycoon and the clown. In the Anglo-Saxon media world, Rupert Murdoch, owner of far too many newspapers, TV stations, and movie studios, is a typical populist tycoon. But he never aspired to lead a country. Former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi and former Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra did – and still do. Neither the clown nor the tycoon is well suited to being a democratic leader. The question is which is worse. Clowns have always played a role in politics. Medieval court jesters were often the only ones who could speak truth to despotic kings. Today, it is often comedians who claim to speak truth to power – and to the public. In America, liberals turn for political commentary to television comedians like Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert, who are now more trusted than traditional news broadcasters. And clownish right-wing radio talk-show hosts now have more influence on many conservative American voters than the sober journalists of the mainstream media do. A few years ago, a clown named Brozo, with a large red nose and a bright green wig, was Mexico’s most popular political commentator on television, actively courted by all candidates running for national office. In 1980, the French clown Coluche actually dropped out of the presidential race when one newspaper put his popular support at 16%, causing him to fear that he might influence the result too much. The prototype of modern European populism was the flamboyant Dutch political showman Pim Fortuyn, who was assassinated in 2002 by a fanatical vegan. Fortuyn’s outrageousness was deliberately provocative and always entertaining. His rants against the elites were often confused, but he was funny, which made the old elite politicians look like stuffy old bores – which many of them were. And now Italy has Beppe Grillo, whose success in the country’s recent election makes him the first professional comedian to lead a major political party in Europe. The thing about clowns, though, is that few have any aspirations to rule their countries. Before his death, Fortuyn is said to have been terrified of the prospect of becoming Prime Minister. And Grillo cannot even aspire to the job in Italy because of his criminal record. Clowns mostly seek to provoke, and this can be healthy. They are less likely than members of the professional political class to allow political calculations to influence their views. And, sometimes, they actually say things that are uncomfortable but true, and that need to be said. Political business tycoons, on the other hand, have different ambitions. They attack the old elites not to shake things up, but to take their power. Promising to spread the riches that they have made for themselves, they exploit the fantasies of those of us who have little and want more. Berlusconi understood the dreams of many Italians very well. His extravagance, clownishness, and even his girls were part of his popular appeal. In Thailand, the self-made ethnic-Chinese media billionaire Thaksin Shinawatra was especially admired by the rural poor. Like a beneficent king, he would give them money, and promised to challenge the old elites in Bangkok – the bankers, generals, judges, and even the courtiers surrounding the Thai king. But tycoons are not natural democrats. Their main interest is in their own business. And they do not hesitate to undermine an independent press or judiciary when their business interests are threatened. Even though his sister, Yingluck Shinawatra, is now in power, Thaksin is still trying to evade trial in Thai courts on a wide array of financial charges. As it happens, Thaksin was overthrown in 2006 by a military coup that was largely backed by the Bangkok elites. Berlusconi was replaced by a government run by elite technocrats, whose policies had to be approved by European bankers and European Union bureaucrats. Neither of these responses to populism is likely to boost democracy. On the contrary, they make things worse. What is needed is mainstream politicians who understand and respond to what is fueling popular rage. Paying attention to some of what the clowns are saying might be a good first step.",
            "小丑上台 纽约 — — 上月底，太多意大利人投票选举一位声名狼藉的商业大亨和一名喜剧演员导致欧洲股市出现暴跌。 公众对政治阶层失去信任可能导致意大利局势失控。 但意大利人绝非个别现象。 对政治体制的怒火在世界各地随处可见。 中国的博客写手、美国的茶党激进分子、英国的恐欧主义者、埃及的伊斯兰教徒、荷兰的民粹主义者、希腊的极右派和泰国的“红衫军”都有一个共同点：仇恨现状及鄙视国内精英阶层。 我们生活在民粹主义时代。 传统的政治家和传统媒体正在迅速丧失权威。 民粹主义可以作为对政党僵化、大众媒体自满（或太过亲权 ） 、 以及官僚机构对大众需求反应迟钝的一种必要的修复。 很多人在由银行家和技术专家管理的全球化世界中感觉丧失了公共事务发言权，这些人感到被抛弃了。 国内政治家应对严重危机越来越力不从心，公众往往怀疑他们只想保护自身的利益，而公众的怀疑其实也很有道理。 我们只想投票将无赖赶下台，有时甚至因此而投给那些在正常情况下不会受到关注的候选人。 需要重新振作的不仅仅是意大利精英。 但问题是民粹主义很少有良性结果，比方说在20世纪30年代导致由身着制服的危险份子领导的暴力运动。 而今天的民粹主义者则有所不同。 总体而言他们并不赞成暴力运动。 有人宣扬穆斯林正在摧毁西方文明。 也有人认为奥巴马总统是要毁掉美国的共产主义份子。 于是超级商业大亨和小丑这两类当代民粹主义者脱颖而出。 盎格鲁－撒克逊世界的传媒大亨鲁珀特·默多克拥有数不清的报纸、电视台和电影制片厂，可谓是民粹主义大亨的典型。 但他从未有志于担任国家领袖。 意大利前总理西尔维奥·贝卢斯科尼和泰国前总理他信则有志于此 — — 他们现在仍不改初衷。 民主领袖的合适人选既不是小丑也不是大亨。 问题在于哪个更差劲。 小丑一直在政治领域发挥重要作用。 中世纪的宫廷小丑往往是唯一敢对专制君主讲真话的人。 今天，声称对当权者和民众直言不讳的往往是喜剧演员。 美国人认为乔恩·斯图尔特和斯蒂芬·科尔伯特等电视喜剧演员比新闻主播的传统政治评论更值得信任。 幽默滑稽的右翼电台脱口秀主持人比严肃的主流媒体记者更能影响美国的选民。 几年前，一位大红鼻头、亮绿假发的Brozo小丑曾是墨西哥最受欢迎的电视政治评论员，并得到所有政界候选人的着意拉拢。 1980年，法国小丑Coluche其实是主动退出总统竞选，原因是一家报纸统计其民意支持率为16 % ， 这让他担心会过于影响选举结果。 2002年遭狂热素食主义者暗杀的夸张的荷兰政治表演者皮姆·佛杜恩是现代欧洲民粹主义的原型。 佛杜恩肆无忌惮的故意挑衅常令人忍俊不禁。 他对精英阶层的斥责往往令人困惑，但他的滑稽可笑让老派精英政治家看去古板而令人生厌 — — 这也确实是很多人的真实写照。 现在意大利有了毕普·格里罗，格里罗成功赢得刚刚结束的大选使他成为有史以来领导欧洲主要政党的首位专业喜剧演员。 但小丑的问题在于他们鲜有管理国家的愿望。 据说佛杜恩死前想起担任首相就不寒而栗。 而格里罗甚至因为有过犯罪记录而不允许在意大利任职。 小丑一般都乐于挑衅，而这可以成为他们的优势。 与职业政客相比，他们不大可能让政治算计影响自己的意见。 而且有时的确会说些有益无害的刺耳的真话。 另一方面，政界的商业巨子往往另有野心。 他们攻击老派精英并非想寻求改革，而是想抢夺政权。 他们许诺要让更多人像他们那样拥有财富，以此来利用两手空空却满怀希望者的幻觉。 贝卢斯科尼深刻理解许多意大利人的梦想。 他的挥霍无度、反覆无常，甚至就连他的桃色新闻都让他更有吸引力。 在泰国，白手起家的华裔传媒富豪他信·西那瓦尤其受到农村贫困人口的推崇。 他会像仁慈的国王那样给他们钱，并承诺挑战曼谷的银行家、将军、法官、甚至是泰国国王臣子等老牌精英。 但富豪并不等同于民主人士。 自身的商业利益是他们主要的兴趣点。 在商业利益受到威胁时他们会毫不犹豫地破坏新闻和司法独立。 即使当权的英拉·西那瓦是自己的妹妹，他信仍试图逃避泰法院对一系列财务指控的审判。 推翻他信的恰好是2006年一次主要由曼谷精英发起的军事政变。 精英技术专家管理的政府接替了贝卢斯科尼，这些人的政策必须得到欧洲银行家和欧盟官僚的核准。 上面提到的民粹主义反应不太可能推动民主。 相反，情况可能进一步恶化。 我们需要的是了解民众愤怒根源并愿意采取对策的主流政治家。 倾听小丑的心声也许是不错的开始。"

            "Why Don’t We Trust Our Leaders? OXFORD – In developed democracies today, political leadership is increasingly up for grabs. Voters, clearly tired of the status quo, want change at the top, leaving even major parties’ establishments struggling to install leaders of their choosing. In the United Kingdom, Labour Party MPs have been stymied in their efforts to unseat Jeremy Corbyn as leader. In Japan, the ruling Liberal Democratic Party’s preferred candidate for Governor of Tokyo, Hiroya Masuda, lost in a landslide to Yuriko Koike. As for the United States, the Republican Party wanted virtually anybody except Donald Trump to win the nomination for the presidency; yet Trump it is. And while the Democratic Party is being represented by the establishment choice, Hillary Clinton, her competitor, Bernie Sanders, put up a much stronger fight than virtually anyone anticipated. The message to the establishment is clear: we don’t trust you anymore. But some of the leaders voters do trust could pose a very real danger – to their supporters, their countries, and the world. Trump – with his admiration of dictators, unabashed racism and sexism, ignorance regarding the issues, and mercurial temperament – stands at the top of this list. Those who led the British campaign to leave the European Union – such as Conservatives like Boris Johnson (now the country’s foreign secretary) and Nigel Farage, the right-wing populist leader of the UK Independence Party – are similarly disparaged for recklessly jeopardizing the future of the UK and the EU alike. If mainstream leaders want to change voters’ minds, they should look carefully at what leadership really means. Here, it is worth recalling the insights of US General George C. Marshall, who contemplated the topic as he worked to rebuild the US military in the 1940s. Marshall argued that leadership is a matter not of rhetoric, but of character. In particular, leaders must display three key qualities to win the trust needed to lead effectively: purpose, impartiality, and competence. Purpose, in his view, meant putting the greater good ahead of one’s own interests. This kind of leadership still exists. A shining example is Jo Cox, the young British MP who was murdered during the Brexit campaign, whose leadership in advocating for the rights of refugees was recognized across party lines. But, in many cases, politics has become a matter of self-promotion – and a race for ratings. In today’s celebrity culture, politicians must be “personalities.” They campaign like contestants on a reality TV show. Trump, with his clownish looks and showbiz resume, is probably the ultimate example of this shift. (The Huffington Post even decided last summer to publish coverage of Trump’s campaign in its entertainment section.) The problem is not only that this can lead to the election of utterly unqualified leaders. It is also that, once elected, even qualified leaders can struggle to shed the personal elements of their decision-making, and serve the country impartially instead. The slippery slope is exposed in a memo – recently disclosed as part of the UK’s Chilcot Inquiry – written by former British Prime Minister Tony Blair to former US President George W. Bush in the run-up to the Iraq war. The note begins, “I will be with you, whatever.” He was talking about leading his country into war. Yet his language suggests that his personal bond with Bush somehow took precedence over his duty as Prime Minister. Leading with purpose, rather than personality, is closely related to the impartiality that Marshall thought essential. Once in office, leaders must act with fairness and candor. They must resist the temptation to use official power to benefit themselves, their families, or their cultural identity group, and refuse enticements, however powerful they may be, to offer special access or protection to friends, funders, and lobbyists. Maintaining a high standard of impartiality is not easy, but it is far from impossible. President Pedro Pires of Cape Verde was awarded the 2011 Ibrahim Prize for Achievement in African Leadership, for transforming his country into “a model of democracy, stability, and increased prosperity.” Pires retired from office without even a house to his name; he worked for the people, not to amass personal wealth. The third criterion for good leadership – competence – is not just a matter of how much knowledge a leader already possesses. As Marshall noted, it also consists in leaders’ capacity to learn from their mistakes and to prepare themselves and those around them for important decisions. Chilcot’s verdict on Britain’s lack of preparation for the Iraq War and its aftermath is damning in this regard. So is the Brexiteers’ lack of any plan whatsoever for how to proceed after the referendum. It is time to revitalize good leadership. Voters need to see candidates who show purpose, impartiality, and competence. If they don’t, they will continue to vote against the establishment that they believe has failed them – even if it means voting for turmoil in Europe or a reckless narcissist in the US.",
            "为什么我们不信任我们的领导人？ 牛津—在当今发达民主国家，政治领导权日益变得人人可争而得之。 选民显然已经厌倦了现状，想要顶层发生变化，就连主流政党的建制派都难以安插他们选定的领导人。 在英国，工党议员罢黜党首杰瑞米·科尔宾（Jeremy Corbyn）的努力严重受阻。 在日本，执政党自民党中意的东京都知事增田宽也惨败给了小池百合子。 至于美国，共和党几乎愿意让任何人赢得总统提名人，只要不是唐纳德·特朗普；然而偏偏唐纳德·特朗普赢了。 而民主党尽管仍然由建制派的选择希拉里·克林顿代表，其竞争对手伯尼·桑德斯（Bernie Sanders）斗争之激烈超过了几乎所有人的预料。 对建制派来说，信号是明确的：我们再也不信任你们了。 但选民果真信任的一些领导人有可能带来非常切实的危险 — — 对支持者、对国家，也对世界。 特朗普 — — 及其对独裁者的景仰、毫不遮掩的种族主义和性别歧视、对相关问题的无知以及喜怒无常的习性 — — 首屈一指。 领导英国脱欧阵营的人 — — 如保守党鲍里斯·约翰逊（Boris Johnson，现任英国外交大臣）和英国独立党的右翼民粹主义领导人尼格尔·法拉奇（Nigel Farage ） — —也因为肆意践踏英国和欧盟的未来而被人唾弃。 如果主流领导人想要改变选民的观点，应该认真想想领导力真正意味着什么。 在这方面，我们值得回顾美国五星上将乔治·马歇尔的洞见。 他在20世纪40年代重建美军时思考过这个问题。 马歇尔认为，领导力是气质问题，不是修辞问题。 特别是，领导人必须展现三大关键品质才能赢得有效领导所需要的信任：目标（purpose ） 、 公平（impartiality）和胜任力（competence ） 。 在马歇尔看来，目标意味着大大超越一个人的自身利益。 这类领导力仍然存在。 一个显著的例子是在英国脱欧运动期间遭到杀害的年轻英国议员乔·考克斯（Jo Cox ） ， 他在推进难民权利方面的领导力得到了超越党派界线的承认。 但是，在许多例子中，政治沦为自我推销 — — 以及流品（ratings）的竞赛。 在当今名人文化中，政客必须“有个性 ” 。 他们的竞选活动好比实时电视秀。 特朗普形象滑稽，深谙娱乐圈之道，堪称这一转变的终极范例。 （去年夏天 ， 《 霍芬顿邮报》甚至决定将特朗普竞选活动的报道放在娱乐版。 ） 问题不仅在于这可能导致选出完全不够格的领导人。 问题还在于，一旦当选，甚至合格的领导人也可能忙于在决策中打上个人烙印，无法做到公平地服务于国家。 这一急转直下可以从一份最近作为英国奇尔科特调查（Chilcot Inquiry）的一部分被披露的备忘录中一窥端倪。 该备忘录由英国前首相布莱尔写给美国前总统小布什，时间在伊拉克战争前夕。 备忘录开头写道 ， “ 不管发生���么，我将与你同在 。 ” 他谈的是领导国家进入战争。 但他的语言表明他与小布什的个人关系似乎还在他作为首相的指责之前。 以目标而不是个性来领导与马歇尔认为的关键要素 — — 公平密切相关。 上台后，领导人必须公正坦率地行动。 他们必须抵制以权谋私 — — 谋他们自己、他们的家庭或他们的文化认同群体之私 — — 的诱惑，并拒绝为朋友、金主和游说集团提供特殊便利或照顾的诱惑，不管他们多么强大。 保持高公平标准绝非易事，但也绝非不可能。 佛得角总统佩德罗·皮雷（Pedro Pires）2011年获得易卜拉欣非洲领导力成就奖（Ibrahim Prize for Achievement in African Leadership ） ， 原因是他将他的国家改变为“民主、稳定和日益繁荣的典范 ” 。 皮雷离职时名下没有一栋房产；他为人民工作，而不是为敛财工作。 好领导力的第三个标准 — — 胜任力 — — 并不只是具备多少知识那么简单。 马歇尔指出，胜任力还包括领导人从错误中学习和让自己和周围人群随时做好做出重要决定的能力。 奇尔科特调查认定英国对伊拉克战争及其后果准备不足，便是对胜任力的全盘否定。 英国脱欧派完全没有处理公投后果的计划亦然。 必须重振好领导力。 选民需要看到候选人如何展现目标、公平和胜任力。 如果没有，他们将继续投票反对他们认为辜负了他们的建制派 — — 即使这意味着投票支持欧洲的动乱和美国的鲁莽自恋狂。"

            "The Battle for Water NEW YORK – The sharpening international geopolitical competition over natural resources has turned some strategic resources into engines of power struggle. Transnational water resources have become an especially active source of competition and conflict, triggering a dam-building race and prompting growing calls for the United Nations to recognize water as a key security concern. Water is different from other natural resources. After all, there are substitutes for many resources, including oil, but none for water. Similarly, countries can import fossil fuels, mineral ores, and resources from the biosphere like fish and timber; but they cannot import water, which is essentially local, on a large scale and on a prolonged – much less permanent – basis. Water is heavier than oil, making it very expensive to ship or transport across long distances even by pipeline (which would require large, energy-intensive pumps). The paradox of water is that it sustains life but can also cause death when it becomes a carrier of deadly microbes or takes the form of a tsunami, flash flood, storm, or hurricane. Many of the greatest natural disasters of our time – including, for example, the Fukushima catastrophe in 2011 – have been water-related. Global warming is set to put potable-water supplies under increasing strain – even as oceans rise and the intensity and frequency of storms and other extreme weather events increase. Rapid economic and demographic expansion has already turned adequate access to potable water into a major issue across large parts of the world. Lifestyle changes, for example, have spurred increasing per capita water consumption, with rising incomes promoting dietary change, for example, especially higher consumption of meat, production of which is ten times more water-intensive, on average, than plant-based calories and proteins. Today, the earth’s human population totals slightly more than seven billion, but the livestock population at any given time numbers more than 150 billion. The direct ecological footprint of the livestock population is larger than that of the human population, with rapidly rising global meat consumption becoming a key driver of water stress by itself. Political and economic water wars are already being waged in several regions, reflected in dam construction on international rivers and coercive diplomacy or other means to prevent such works. Consider, for example, the silent water war triggered by Ethiopia’s dam building on the Blue Nile, which has elicited Egyptian threats of covert or overt military reprisals. A report reflecting the joint judgment of US intelligence agencies warned last year that the use of water as a weapon of war or a tool of terrorism would become more likely in the next decade in some regions. The InterAction Council, comprising more than 30 former heads of state or government, has called for urgent action to prevent some countries battling severe water shortages from becoming failed states. The US State Department, for its part, has upgraded water to “a central US foreign policy concern.” In many countries, inadequate local water availability is increasingly constraining decisions about where to set up new manufacturing facilities and energy plants. The World Bank estimates that such constraints are costing China 2.3% of GDP. China, however, is not yet in the category of water-stressed states. Those that are, stretching from South Korea and India to Egypt and Israel, are paying an even higher price for their water problems. These countries already understand that water is a renewable but finite resource. Nature’s water-replenishment capacity is fixed, limiting the world’s usable freshwater resources to about 200,000 cubic kilometers. But the human population has almost doubled since 1970, while the global economy has grown even faster. Major increases in water demand, however, are being driven not merely by economic and demographic growth, or by the additional energy, manufacturing, and food production to meet rising consumption levels, but also by the fact that the global population is getting fatter. The average body mass index (BMI) of humans has been increasing in the post-World War II period, but especially since the 1980’s, with the prevalence of obesity doubling in the past three decades. Heavier citizens make heavier demands on natural resources, especially water and energy. The issue thus is not just about how many mouths there are to feed, but also how much excess body fat there is on the planet. For example, a study published in the British journal BMC Public Health has found that if the rest of the world had the same average body mass index as the US, this would be the equivalent of adding almost one billion people to the global population, greatly exacerbating water stress. With the era of cheap, bountiful water having been replaced by increasing supply and quality constraints, many investors are beginning to view water as the new oil. The dramatic rise of the bottled-water industry since the 1990’s attests to the increasing commodification of the world’s most critical resource. Not only are water shortages likely to intensify and spread, but consumers also will increasingly have to pay more for their water supply. This double whammy can be mitigated only by innovative water management and conservation, and by developing nontraditional supply sources. As in the oil and gas sector – where tapping unconventional sources, such as shale and tar sands, has proved a game changer – the water sector must adopt all unconventional options, including recycling wastewater and desalinating ocean and brackish waters. In short, we must focus on addressing our water-supply problems as if our lives depended on it. In fact, they do.",
            "水之战争 纽约—自然资源的国际地缘政治竞争愈演愈烈，导致一些战略之源成了实力斗争的推动器。 跨国水资源已成为特别活跃的竞争和冲突原因，引发了各国的建坝竞赛，越来越多的人呼吁联合国把水看做关键性安全问题。 水和其他自然资源不同。 毕竟，许多资源都能找到替代品，包括石油，但水不行。 类似地，国家可以进口化石燃料、矿石和其他诸如鱼和木材等生物资源；但国家不能进口水，从根本上说，水是大规模、长时间（尽管远非持久）的立国之本。 水重于油，这决定了船运或长途输送（即使使用管道进行，而这又需要大型能源密集型水泵）成本极其高昂。 水的悖论之处在于，它能维持生命，但也可以造成死亡，如果它成为致命微生物携带者或以海啸、洪水、风暴或飓风形式来临的话。 许多现时代最严重的自然灾害 — — 包括2011年福岛灾难 — — 都和水有关。 全球变暖使得饮用水供应日渐捉襟见肘 — — 尽管海平面有所上升，风暴和其他极端天气事件的烈度和频率都在增加。 经济和人口的快速扩张已经让获得充足的饮用水成为世界大部地区的主要问题。 比如，生活方式的转变刺激了人均水消费量的增加，比如收入上升促使饮食结构发生了改变，特别是肉类消费有所提高，而平均而言，生产肉类卡路里和蛋白质的水密集程度十倍于植物。 如今，地球人口总数略高于70亿，但任何时候的牲口数量都超过1500亿。 随着全球肉类消费的迅速增长本身已成为水压力的主要推动因素，牲口数量的直接生态足迹比人类更大。 政治和经济上的谁战争已经在不少地区打响，国际河流上的水坝建设以及用强制外交或其他手段防止这类工程的尝试就是明��。 比如，埃塞俄比亚在青尼罗河上修建大坝便引起了静悄悄的谁战争，埃及已表示要进行隐蔽或公然的军事报复。 去年的一份体现美国情报机构联合判断的报告警告说，未来十年，某些地区极有可能把水作为战争武器或恐怖主义工具。 由30多位前国家或政府领导人组成的国际行动理事会（InterAction Council）呼吁立刻采取行动防止某些与严重水短缺做着艰苦斗争的国家沦为失败国家。 美国国务院也将水升格为“美国外交政策核心关注点之一 ” 。 在许多国家，本地水资源不足正在日益制约何处建设新生产设施和发电站的决策。 世界银行估计，这一制约因素给中国造成的成本相当于GDP的2 % 。 但是，中国并非水严重短缺国。 属于此类的国家 — — 从韩国和印度到埃及和以色列 — — 因为水问题付出的代价更加高昂。 这些国家已经认识到，水是一种可再生但有限的资源。 大自然的水补充能力是固定的，世界可用淡水资源总量只有200 000立方千米。 但自1970年以来，人口数量已接近翻番，而全球经济增长速度更加迅速。 但是，水需求的大量增加并不仅仅是由经济和人口增长推动的，也不仅仅是由于满足消费水平升高而增加能源、制造品和食品产量导致的，全球人口越来越胖也是原因之一。 人类平均体重指数（BMI）自二战结束以来节节上升，且自20世纪80年代以后加速增长，过去三十年中肥胖率翻了一番。 变重的人民导致了变重的自然资源需求，特别是水和能源需求。 因此，问题不仅在于有多少张嘴需要喂饱，还在于地球上有多少多于的人体脂肪。 比如，英国《BMC公共卫生 》 （ BMC Public Health）杂志发表的一项研究发现，如果全世界平均体重指数都向美国看齐，其效果相当于全球人口增加近十亿人，会大大增加水压力。 充足、廉价的水时代已经一去不返，取而代之的是日益加剧的供给和质量制约，在这样的局面下，许多投资者开始把水视为新的石油。 20世纪90年代以来，瓶装水行业蓬勃发展，这是世界最关键资源日益商品化的写照。 不仅水短缺可能恶化和蔓延，消费者也将为水供应支付越来越高的价格。 只有水管理和保护方面的创新、开发非传统供给源能减轻这一双重难题。 和油气行业一样 — — 从页岩和油砂等非常规资源中提取石油已经成为局面改变因素 — — 水行业也必须尽可能采取非常规手段，包括循环利用废水和淡化海水和咸水。 简言之，我们必须把解决我们水供应问题当作生死攸关的大事来关注。"

            "The Biology of Luxury PARIS – Despite the global economic crisis, sales of luxury goods are surging worldwide. Why? While marketing has contributed to the rise, the luxury market’s robust growth is actually rooted in biology. Discussions about the structure of human thought have long been dominated by the Enlightenment view that reality is composed of four elements: space, time, matter, and energy. But recently, a fifth element, information, has entered the debate. And information, it turns out, is crucial to understanding the fundamental drivers of luxury-goods consumption, and thus to predicting the luxury market’s future. Living organisms communicate, and the information that they exchange shapes their reality. While animals use colorful displays and complicated behaviors to signal fitness and strength, humans use luxury goods to demonstrate economic health. But, more than a symbol, buying luxury goods could indicate future success, owing to the selective advantage that showing off provides. In nature, competitors perform, and the most compelling, beautiful spectacle wins. For most animals, males are the performers. Male birds, for example, often have brightly colored plumage or intricate appendages, such as the Australian lyrebird’s long tail. As a result, competitive displays have been interpreted as a way to demonstrate fitness to a potential mate. A bird that survives, despite inconvenient plumage that slows it down or makes it visible to predators, must be fit, and will likely sire a healthy progeny. Given that females bear the physical burden of offspring, an unobtrusive appearance is more advantageous – and thus more common – in nature. But humans are social creatures with no natural predators, so female competition is more widespread – and demonstrative performance and display are more likely. Indeed, while visual manifestations of wealth are prevalent for both genders, women’s appearance is frequently more vivid (and more closely scrutinized). But effective display is costly. Developing complex, vibrant plumage demands significant energy and genetic resources. Genes are difficult to maintain, requiring subtle and energy-intensive correcting processes. Just as writing too fast can cause typographical errors that garble a text, rapid changes to the genome can undermine a species’ integrity. Likewise, purchasing luxury goods requires substantial financial resources. This cost dictates the display’s competitive impact. In today’s information-based world, selection is effective only if a striking appearance is obtained at a very high price – and that price is known. For example, those who use cosmetics known to be expensive often seem healthier, more vibrant, and more attractive than those who do not. This is not the result of efficiency (the most effective cosmetics frequently become pharmaceutical drugs). Rather, it signals a lifestyle that values the preservation of beauty and youth. Cosmetics, like all luxury products, gain influence not from their production, or even their purchase, but from their visibility. Indeed, an expensive item with no label or identifying characteristics has less competitive impact than a recognized item or brand. For luxury goods to have any function, society needs information about their cost. This has been true to varying degrees throughout history – sometimes resulting in price bubbles. False information, such as counterfeit goods, jeopardizes the competition-based selection process. Animals commonly use mimicry to capitalize on knowledge – or fear – of another’s strength. By imitating an animal with a well-known protective profile, a weaker one may enjoy selective benefits without the costs. But mimicry’s success in nature depends on the ratio of the original to the ersatz. If there are too few of the original, the profile loses its significance, and its protective value vanishes. Similarly, nobody would display a symbol of wealth if it were too common. Therefore, assessing whether luxury goods will maintain their impact, and thus their appeal, requires monitoring the extent of counterfeiting. Given that luxury goods provide individuals with a competitive advantage, higher luxury-goods sales could indicate a brighter economic future for a country. In a time of crisis, countries in which luxury goods play their selective role effectively are the safest bets for productive investment.",
            "奢侈品中的生物学 巴黎 — — 尽管受到全球经济危机的影响，全球奢侈品的销售仍在激增。 这究竟是什么原因？ 尽管营销活动能够部分解释奢侈品消费的上涨，但奢侈品市场的强劲增长究其原因实际要归功于生物学。 对人类思想结构的探讨长期以来深受启蒙运动的影响，认为现实由空间、时间、物质和能量等四种要素组成。 但不久前，信息作为第五种要素进入了讨论的范畴。 而且事实证明信息对于理解奢侈品消费的根本动因至关重要，因此可以预测奢侈品市场的未来。 活体生物相互交流，他们对现实的理解取决于他们所交换的信息。 动物用缤纷的色彩和复杂的行为来显示健康和力量，而人类则利用奢侈品作为经济状况的标志。 但购买奢侈品绝不仅仅是一种标志，鉴于炫耀所能提供的选择性优势，它还可能预示着未来的成功。 自然界中有竞争才有成就，最引人注目、最美丽者最终胜出。 对多数动物而言，雄性动物更需要竞争。 比如雄性鸟类往往拥有色彩艳丽的羽毛或精致复杂的长尾，像澳大利亚琴鸟就拖着长长的尾巴。 结果是竞争性炫耀被视为向潜在配偶展示健康的方法。 漂亮的羽毛吸引掠食者，拖慢奔跑速度，但在羽毛的拖累下仍可存活的鸟类肯定非常健康，而且繁衍出健康的后代的可能性也较大。 因为雌性承担着繁衍后代的任务，外表不引人注目似乎是明智的选择 — — 因此在自然界中这种现象也是比较普遍的。 但人类是没有天敌的社会动物，因此存在着普遍的女性竞争 — — 也更有可能出现炫耀性的行为和举动。 其实，虽然炫富在男女两性中均颇为盛行，但女性的表现似乎更加生动（也更受人关注 ） 。 但有效的炫耀行为代价不菲。 长出精致漂亮的羽毛需要耗费可观的能量和遗传资源。 基因很难维护，需要耗费大量的能量来进行微妙的调校过程。 就像写字过快可能导致错字从而改变字意一样，基因的快速变化也可能破坏物种的完整性。 同样，购买奢侈品需要雄厚的财力支撑。 付出的成本决定炫耀行为的竞争性影响力。 在当今这个以信息为本的世界，只有以极高代价取得醒目的外观才能在选择中产生实际作用 — — 上述代价是人所共知的。 比方说，选用人所共知的昂贵化妆品的人往往看起来更健康、更有活力，比那些不用的人吸引力更强。 这并非效果使然（最有效的化妆品往往是某种药品 ） 。 相反，它标志着一种重视保持美丽和青春的生活方式。 像所有奢侈品一样，化妆品的影响不是源于生产，甚至也不是源于购买，而是源于品牌知名度。 其实，没有标志或识别指征的昂贵物品比为人所知的品牌或物品要少有影响力。 奢侈品要想发挥作用，社会必须了解它的价值。 这有史以来或多或少都是真理 — — 有时还会导致价格泡沫。 假冒商品所释放的虚假信息损害了以竞争为本的选择性过程。 动物往往通过模仿来利用对其他同类力量的了解或恐惧。 通过模仿众所周知的具有保护性的动物，弱者可以不付出任何代价就可以享受到选择性收益。 但自然界中模拟的成功取决于原版和替代品之间的比例。 原版太过稀少的形象就会失去意义，与之相关的保护价值也会大打折扣。 同样，没有人会去炫耀司空见惯的财富象征。 因此评估奢侈品是否会保持影响力和吸引力需要控制假冒产品的泛滥程度。 鉴于奢侈品能为个体带来竞争性优势，一个国家奢侈品销售的增长可能预示着更美好的经济未来。 危机时期奢侈品有效发挥选择作用的国家是进行生产性投资的理想对象。"

            "Why Wolfensohn Mattered At the end of this month, James Wolfensohn’s ten-year tenure as President of the World Bank comes to an end. Though much remains to be accomplished and consolidated, his achievements as leader of the international development community are noteworthy and provide a strong foundation upon which to build. Perhaps Wolfensohn’s most important contribution was to clarify the Bank’s mission – to promote growth and eradicate poverty in the developing world – while recognizing the massive scale of that task and the inadequacy of previous approaches. At one time, it was thought that since developing countries had less capital than more developed countries, merely supplying more capital would solve their problems. Indeed, this view provided part of the rationale for the World Bank: if a shortage of funds was the problem, clearly a Bank would have to be a key part of the solution. In the 1980’s, there was a switch from projects to policies – structural adjustments, involving trade liberalization, privatization, and macroeconomic stabilization (typically focusing on prices rather than employment or output.) But these policies proved neither necessary nor sufficient for growth; the countries of East Asia, which followed different policies, achieved faster growth and were far more successful in poverty reduction. Under Wolfensohn’s leadership, the Bank began to look for multifaceted strategies, framed by what he called a Comprehensive Development Framework. Many of the links were obvious, but had been given insufficient attention. Improved rural productivity or better market access would do little good if roads and harbors were lacking. In a malaria-infested country, mosquito eradication programs can boost production and even increase effective land usage, as acres that were almost uninhabitable become livable. The returns from education, too, can be increased, if more individuals live longer because of better health care. The Bank began to recognize that developing countries differed from more developed countries not just in their lack of resources; there was also a knowledge gap. This was particularly important as the world moved into what we call the “knowledge economy.” Among the success stories were India and East Asia, which invested heavily not just in primary education, but also in secondary and tertiary education, and especially in technology and science. This represented a major change in the Bank’s approach to education, which previously focused on primary schooling . Wolfensohn’s campaign against corruption also represented a major change in thinking, a shift from downsizing the state to improving the State. Failed states, it was now acknowledged, were no less an impediment to development than were overbearing states. The Bank’s 1997 World Development Report reflected this new attempt at finding a balanced role for the state, and showed an understanding of the limitations both of markets and government. Under Wolfensohn, the Bank repeatedly stood up to the United States, where both the Clinton and Bush administrations might have preferred a more pliant President. When then US Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Lawrence Summers tried to change the Bank’s Decennial report on poverty – to downgrade concerns about insecurity and empowerment and to focus more narrowly on income – the Bank prevailed. When the US tried to suppress the Bank’s call for a more balanced intellectual property regime – one more consonant with the interests of developing countries – the Bank prevailed yet again. Both the Bush administration and the EU would undoubtedly have preferred less criticism of their trade regimes, which have such adverse effects on developing countries. It would have been helpful for Bush if the World Bank quietly accepted proposals to finance debt relief for the poorest countries by depleting its reserves, thereby making poor countries pay for the poorest by reducing the Bank’s lending capacity. But it would have been wrong, and the Bank again stood up for the interests of the developing world. Changing the relationship between the Bank and the countries seeking its help was no less of an achievement. In the past, the Bank was seen as a purveyor of neoliberal orthodoxy – an approach to development whose credibility had weakened by the time Wolfensohn arrived, and whose standing has eroded further since. That orthodoxy often went hand in hand with the national, corporate, and financial interests of the advanced industrial countries, or so it was perceived. Worse, the Bank typically demanded myriad conditions in return for assistance, an approach that undermined democratic processes and domestic ownership of policies, thereby enervating their effectiveness. When Bank research showed that conditionality did not work, the Bank under Wolfensohn moved away from it. The Bank began to realize that on many key issues there were legitimate disagreements among economists about the right course of action. Democracy requires active debate about economic policies, not the suppression of discussion or the delegation of decision-making to experts, whether domestic or foreign. The Bank’s attempt to open the debate was not well received, by either the US Treasury or the IMF, but its influence was undeniable. The Fund, too, began to reduce conditionality, and eventually it began to question the desirability of capital market liberalization, which previously had been central to its agenda. Gradually the Bank came to be perceived, at least in many quarters, as a partner in the joint quest for growth and poverty reduction, not an adversary attempting to promote a Western economic agenda or ideology. Wolfensohn meant it when he said that he wanted to put the country in the driver’s seat, though not everyone within the Bank was as enthusiastic about this (or some of his other) initiatives. James Wolfensohn presided over the World Bank at a time of enormous change, tumult, and opportunity, an era marked by the end of the Cold War, the postcommunist transition to market economies, and the East Asian – and then global – financial crises. His commitment to those in the developing world has been contagious. He has left an impressive legacy for his successor to take up.",
            "Wolfensohn为何如此重要 这个月底，James Wolfensohn作为世界银行总裁的十年任期即将结束。 尽管还有很多事情尚待完成和巩固，作为国际发展团体领导人，他所取得的成就非凡卓越，为以后的工作奠定了强有力的基础。 也许Wolfensohn最为重要的一项贡献就是明确了世界银行的使命所在 — — 促进发展中世界的经济增长、消灭贫穷 — — 同时他们也意识到了这个任务的范围之广以及先前方式的不适当。 人们一度以为，由于发达国家比发展中国家拥有更多资本，所以只要提供更多的资本就能够解决发展中国家的问题。 事实上，这个观点为世界银行提供了一部分理由：如果问题就是基金短缺的话，很明显一个银行就必须得成为解决方案的重要部分。 上世纪80年代有了一个从计划到政策的转变 — — 涉及到贸易自由化、民营私有化，以及宏观经济的稳定性（比起就业率和产量，尤为关注价格）的结构调整。 但是事实证明这些政策对经济增长既非必要也无甚效果；东亚许多国家虽然实施着不同的政策，却取得了更快的经济增长，在减少贫穷方面也成功得多。 在Wolfensohn的领导下，世界银行开始寻求一种根据他所称的“全球发展框架”来设计的多层面战略。 许多事物之间的关联显而易见，但却很少有人注意到。 如果没有公路和港口，得以提高的农村产量以及更为良好的市场准入就没无甚优势可言。 在疟疾肆虐的国家，灭蚊计划可以提高产量，甚至还可以提高土地有效使用率，使那些不适于人居住的耕地变得可居住。 如果更多人在健康医疗条件下更加长寿，教育的回报也会增加。 世界银行开始意识到发展中国家与发达国家的区别不仅仅在于他们缺少资源，还有知识方面的缺口。 当世界迈入我们所谓的“知识经济”时代之际，这点显得尤为重要。 印度和东亚取得了成功，他们不仅在初级教育上，也在中等教育和高等教育，尤其是在技术和科学方面大力投资。 这代表了世界银行对教育的一个重大策略改变，它原来只把重点放在初级学校教育。 Wolfensohn发起的抵制腐败运动也代表了思想的一个重大转变，从 减小 国家 规模 转而 改善 国家。 人们现在已经意识到，比起那些失败国家，霸道国家对发展的阻碍更大。 世界银行1997年的《世界银行报告》反映了这一新的尝试，即努力为国家找到平衡角色，并表现出它对市场和政府的局限性的理解。 在Wolfensohn的带领下，世界银行一次次地对抗美国。 克林顿和布什政府也许都会更喜欢一个更为顺从的总裁。 那时候的美国财政部副部长劳伦斯·桑莫斯（Lawrence Summers）试图改变世界银行对贫困问题所作的十年报告 — — 降低对安全缺乏和赋权问题的关注程度，把焦点更集中地放在收入问题上 — — 但是世界银行胜利了。 当世界银行呼吁一个更为平衡、更符合发展国家利益的知识产权制度，而当美国试图压制时，世界银行再次胜利了。 布什政府和欧盟的贸易体系对发展中国家具有如此不利的影响，他们无疑都希望少一点对他们贸易体系的批评。 如果世界银行平静地接受这个提议，即通过耗尽最贫穷国家的储备来为减免他们的债务融资、然后通过减少世界银行的贷款资本让贫穷国家为最贫穷国家付钱，那对布什会大有帮助。 但那将会铸成大错，世界银行再一次为了发展中国家的利益拍案而起。 把改变世界银行与寻求它帮助的国家之间的关系誉为一大功绩毫不为过。 过去，世界银行被认为是通向发展的一种途��� — — 新自由正统学说的传播者。 在Wolfensohn到来之前，新自由正统学说的可信度已经削弱，它的立场自那以后也已经进一步遭到侵蚀。 那个正统学说大致就被认为通常是与发达工业国家的民族、公司和金融利益紧密关联的。 更糟的是，世界银行提出许多条件作为它付出资助的回报，这种做法破坏了民主进程和政策的国内所有权，从而降低这些政策的效率。 当世界银行的调查显示这种方法行不通的时候，Wolfensohn带领下的世界银行抛弃了这种做法。 世界银行开始意识到，经济学家们在许多重要问题上对行动的正确方法存在着诸多合法争论。 民主需要对经济政策的积极辩论，而不是压制辩论或把决定权授予不管是国内还是国外的专家。 世界银行力图打开辩论局面的努力并不被美国财政部或国际货币基金组织所接受，但是它的影响却不可否认。 国际货币基金组织也开始减少条件，并且终于开始质疑人们对资本市场自由化的期待究竟有多高，这原先可是该基金议程的重中之重。 渐渐地，世界银行开始被许多地区看作联合寻求经济增长和减少贫困的合作者，而不再是一个试图推动西方经济议程或意识形态的对手。 当Wolfensohn说他要让国家做主的时候，他就是这个意思，尽管不是每个世界银行里面的人都对此（或他的其他行动）开端持有热情。 James Wolfensohn在一个改革巨变的时代坐上了世界银行总裁的座位，这是一个嘈杂骚动、充满机遇的时代，是一个以冷战结束为标志、后共产主义向市场经济转型、全球紧随东亚发生金融危机的时代。 他对这些发生在发展中世界的一切所做的事情感染了众人，他为他的接班者留下了一笔可观的遗产。"

            "The Case for Digital Identification MUMBAI/SAN FRANCISCO – Worldwide, more than four billion people are connected to the Internet, spending an average of roughly six hours per day on Internet-enabled devices and services. In Thailand and the Philippines, average daily usage is 9.5 hours; in the United States, 26% of the population is online “almost constantly;” and one billion more people in the world are projected to join the ranks of internet users by 2022. Yet as we embrace the digital world, the complexity of navigating it securely, efficiently, and in a personalized manner becomes more acute. One promising solution is already being deployed in some countries: digital identification. The case for “digital IDs” – the electronic equivalent of physical identification– is strong. For starters, most Internet users are unable to keep track of their digital footprint and find it inconvenient to register, authenticate, and manage online accounts. On average, 90 online accounts are linked to every email address, and this total doubles every five years. It is no wonder, then, that 25% of users forget one password at least once a day, and about a third of all calls to banks’ call centers are requests to reset misplaced or forgotten passwords. Carefully designed digital IDs can also help defend against data breaches targeting retailers, a growing concern for many consumers. In just the last two months, for example, security breaches were reported by Marriott and Quora, exposing the personal information of hundreds of millions of customers. As the scope and sophistication of hacks increase, the need for better security is obvious. But perhaps the most compelling argument supporting digital IDs is the most basic: people in developing countries need them to prove who they are. According to the World Bank’s ID4D initiative, nearly one billion people lack any legal identification, making it difficult or impossible to vote, bank, access subsidized food, or buy property. Of the 1.7 billion adults who are currently unbanked, 20-30% cite their lack of documentation as a primary reason. Recognizing the problem – and the potential – dozens of countries are implementing digital IDs in some form. India’s Aadhaar program, for example, is a biometric “proof of identity” that covers more than 1.2 billion residents and is used to coordinate distribution of government benefits. In Estonia, 98% of the population have an electronic ID, and 99% of public services – including voting – can be accessed online. The topic is also appearing more frequently on human-development agendas. In Africa, governments, development agencies, and business leaders gather annually for the ID4Africa forum, which promotes “robust and responsible ID ecosystems.” The private sector – led by the financial services and technology industries – is taking steps to develop digital ID systems. For example, since 2003, a consortium of banks in Sweden has used BankID to authenticate digital transactions, and the system has since been adopted by the government to streamline access to public services and health records. Yet, the reality is that digital ID programs have had mixed success to date. While a few have achieved large-scale implementation, many have failed to attain even modest levels of usage. Most of the world’s digital IDs are limited in scope, enabling only a few of their many possible economic, political, and social functionalities. Digital ID could play a much more expansive role in the way individuals and institutions interact with each other. Digital ID systems that succeed in driving high adoption could create significant economic value for individuals, businesses, and government institutions. As we document in a new report, digital IDs have the potential to reduce fraud rates, cut customer onboarding costs, boost financial inclusion, and deepen savings and credit for under-banked customers. They can also spur development by enabling digital talent matching and streamlined employee verification, resulting in higher participation in the labor market. Digital IDs could even establish a means to control data and digital footprints in interconnected online ecosystems. Overall, we estimate that high adoption of digital ID could help produce economic value equivalent to 3% of GDP in a typical advanced economy and as much as 6% in a typical emerging economy. Digital ID technologies are, however, akin to dual-use technologies that can be used both to the benefit of society and for undesirable purposes. Poorly planned digital ID systems do carry risks. Without proper design principles and controls, a digital ID system can put enormous power into administrators’ hands, enabling unfair discrimination or other inequities. To mitigate these risks, countries will need to develop tough data protection and privacy laws, as well as robust enforcement and security measures. Advances in registration and authentication technologies – such as electronic cards, cryptography, and biometrics – will help, but strong policies will also be essential. Still, while the challenges are real, our research shows that the economic, social, and political benefits are simply too great to ignore. If governments and developers are aware of the risks and act to minimize them, digital ID could become a key to inclusive growth.",
            "数字身份证的争议 发自孟买/旧金山 — — 全球有超过40亿人可以上网，每日人均在互联网设备和服务上逗留约6个小时。 在泰国和菲律宾的网民日均上网为9.5小时；美国有26％的人口“几乎持续”在线；预计到2022年全球还将有10亿人加入互联网用户行列。 然而当我们拥抱数字世界时，以安全，有效，且个性化的方式去使用它的复杂性问题也变得更为尖锐。 对此有些国家已经开始部署一个有前景的解决方案：数字身份识别（ID ） 。 对“数字身份证 ” — —也就是物理身份识别装置的电子对应物 — — 的应用很有必要。 首先，大多数互联网用户往往都无法回想起自己的数字足迹，同时在注册，验证和管理在线帐户方面遭遇了诸多麻烦。 平均每个电子邮件地址都链接了90个在线帐户，而这个数量每五年还会翻一番。 因此不出意外有25％的用户每天至少忘记一个密码，而且各银行客服中心接到的电话中约有1/3是重置错误或忘记密码的请求。 精心设计的数字身份证还可以帮助抵御来之零售商的数据泄露事件，而这也是许多消费者日益关注的问题。 比如在过去两个月中万豪酒店集团和在线问答网站Quora就分别报告了导致数亿客户个人信息被盗的安全泄露事件。 随着黑客攻击范围和复杂程度的提高，对更高安全性的需求显而易见。 但或许支持推广数字身份证的最令人信服论点也是最基本的一条：发展中国家的人们需要这个设备证明自己是谁。 根据世界银行的身份验证发展计划（Identification for Development Initiative，简称ID4D）披露的数字，全球有近10亿人缺乏任何合法身份证明，因此也很难或不可能去投票，银行，获得食品补贴或购买房产。 在目前未有开立银行账户的17亿成年人中有20~30％的人将缺乏相关文件归为主要原因。 认识到这个问题（及其潜力）后，许多国家都在以各类形式推广数字身份证。 例如印度的国家身份认证系统（Aadhaar）就是一个覆盖超过12亿民众的生物识别“身份证明 ” ， 可以用来协调政府福利的分配。 在爱沙尼亚，98％的人口拥有电子身份证，99％的公共服务 — — 包括投票 — — 都可以在线完成。 该议题也更频繁地出现在人类发展议程上。 非洲各国政府，发展机构和本地商业领袖每年都会齐聚非洲身份验证发展论坛（ID4Africa）以期共同推动一个“强大而负责任的身份验证系统 ” 。 同时以金融服务和技术产业为首的私营部门也正采取措施发展数字身份识别系统。 例如瑞典的一个银行联盟在2003年开始使用BankID对数字交易进行身份验证，此后该国政府也采用了该系统去简化对公共服务和健康记录的获取流程。 但现实情况是各个数字身份证计划迄今取得的推广效果各不相同。 虽然少数项目已经得到了大规模实施，但仍有许多项目未能达到适度的使用水平。 全球大多数数字身份证的应用范围有限，只能实现其众多潜在经济，政治和社会功能中的少数几项。 由此可见，数字身份证应当在个人和机构彼此互动的过程中发挥更为广泛的作用。 高使用率数字身份识别系统的成功推广可以为个人，企业和政府机构创造巨大的经济价值。 正如我们在一份新发布的报告中所陈述的那样，数字身份证有可能降低欺诈率，降低客户接入成本，促进金融包容性，同时促进无银行账户客户的储蓄和信贷。 此外还可以通过实现数字化人才匹配和简化员工验证来促进发展，从而提高劳动力市场的参与度。 数字身份证甚至可以成为一种在互联在线生态系统中管控数据和数字足迹的手段。 总体而言，我们估计在典型发达经济体中推广高使用率数字身份证将有助于产生相当于其GDP总量3％的经济价值，而在典型新兴经济体中则可高达6 ％ 。 但数字身份证技术也类似于某些双重用途技术，既可以服务社会利益，也可以用于不良目的。 那些设计有缺陷的数字身份证系统确实存在风险。 如果缺乏适当的设计原则和管控，数字身份证系统可以为管理员提供巨大的权力，令某些不公正歧视或其他不公平现象成为可能。 为此各国需要制定严格的数据保护和隐私法律以及强有力的执法和安全措施以降低这类风险。 注册和认证技术的进步 — — 例如电子卡，密码学和生物识别技术 — — 会有所帮助，但强有力的政策也是必不可少的。 尽管存在这类现实挑战，但我们的研究表明数字身份证也能带来不容忽视的巨大经济，社会和政治收益。 如果政府和发展机构能意识到这些风险并采取措施将其降至最低，那么数字身份证就能成为推动包容性增长的关键一环。"

            "A Virtuous Cycle for Conservation NEW YORK – Poor and rural people around the world rely on plants and animals for shelter, food, income, and medicine. In fact, the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 15) on sustainable ecosystems acknowledges many developing societies’ close relationship with nature when it calls for increased “capacity of local communities to pursue sustainable livelihood opportunities.” But how is this to be achieved? The 1975 Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) provides a viable framework for reducing poverty while also conserving nature. It regulates the harvesting and exchange of more than 35,000 wildlife species across a range of locales. Nature has been described as the “GDP of the poor.” The CITES framework, combined with strong national conservation policies, can simultaneously protect wild species and benefit poor, rural, and indigenous people, by encouraging countries and communities to adopt sound environmental management plans. For example, under CITES, Andes communities shear the vicuña for its fine wool, which they sell to the luxury fashion industry in other parts of the world. Cameroonians collect African cherry bark for export to European pharmaceutical companies. And people on the Tibetan Plateau in Bhutan make a living selling caterpillar fungus to the traditional-medicine industry. However, outside of CITES, limited guidance is available to ensure that legal trade is sustainable and beneficial to the poor. Sustainable trade often depends on poor and rural communities conserving their own resources at the local level. To see what that looks like, the International Trade Center (ITC) recently examined how people in Southeast Asia sustainably manage the CITES-listed python trade. Python skins are commonly used as raw material in the luxury fashion industry, and ITC surveys of python-skin harvesters, farmers, processors, and exporters in Vietnam and Malaysia found that the trade reinforces livelihood resilience by providing an additional source of income. In Vietnam, an estimated 1,000 households farm and trade pythons, and python harvesting in Malaysia provides incomes for low-skilled, low-income workers during periods when other employment opportunities are either out of season, or simply scarce because of larger economic factors. Researchers found that most of those harvesting pythons implement simple and effective sustainable-management plans, and that this has reduced pressure on wild populations. However, python skins, like many wildlife products, are a commodity, so communities harvesting them are limited in terms of how they can add value to increase returns. Women in the Peruvian Andes may clean vicuña wool by hand to increase the price it fetches per kilogram by $50, whereas selling a wool-scarf could yield them $150-200; a Malaysian python skin sells for $200, while a python-skin bag could sell for $2,000. Still, some emerging countries are moving up the value chain and retaining a greater share of returns, as demonstrated by local brands such as Kuna, which markets alpaca and vicuña wool in Peru, and Natura, a Brazilian natural-cosmetic brand. The biggest threats to the legal wildlife trade are poaching, smuggling, improper trade permitting, and animal abuse, all of which must be addressed by regulators and rural community stakeholders at the local level. Fortunately, rural communities are already in the best position to protect wildlife, so long as they are motivated to do so. In the right circumstances, a virtuous cycle, whereby local producers have a direct interest in protecting wildlife (because they are benefiting from its legal trade) is the best – and sometimes the only – long-term solution to the problem of sustainability. To help with this, governments can increase rural communities’ resource- and wildlife-use rights so that they can manage and protect their natural resources sustainably. For example, in the 1970s when Peru granted Andean communities the right to use vicuña wool, it saved the vicuña from extinction and created new, long-term income streams for the community. Because legal and natural circumstances vary by country and community, we will need similar policy innovations across different sectors. One promising sector is tourism, which also fits into the CITES framework. To take one example, since Rwanda began sharing wildlife-tourism revenues with local communities, the mountain-gorilla population has grown. As we see time and again, when local communities are included, they can become resolute wildlife defenders. More generally, we should be supporting scientists working on new adaptive-management methods, and the private sector should be given incentives to invest in greater sustainable sourcing and increased supply- and production-chain transparency. As the examples above show, conservation and improved livelihoods for the rural poor are feasible, and even mutually reinforcing. With more political will and smart investments, there is no reason we can’t reach the SDGs to both reduce poverty and safeguard wildlife for future generations. Last year, the UN passed an historic resolution to tackle illicit wildlife trafficking, recognizing the effectiveness of the CITES legal framework. The resolution calls on the 182 CITES member countries to protect the interests of wildlife as well as to provide tangible benefits for the poor and rural communities. We hope that delegates from those member countries meeting at the World Wildlife Conference in South Africa are hearing that call.",
            "良性保护循环 纽约 — — 世界各地的穷人和农民要靠动植物来获取庇护、食物、收入和药品。 事实上，联合国可持续生态系统的可持续发展目标 (SDG 15) 承认许多发展中社会与自然有着密切的联系，并呼吁强化“当地社会追求可持续谋生机会的能力 。 ” 但究竟该如何实现这一目标？ 1975年野生动植物濒危物种国际贸易公约(CITES)提供了在控制贫困的同时保护自然的可行的架构。 该公约规定了超过35，000种野生物种在一系列区域的生产和交易行为。 大自然被誉为“穷人的GDP ” 。 野生动植物濒危物种国际贸易公约框架结合强势的国内保护政策，可以通过鼓励国家和社会采纳健全的环境管理计划，同时实现保护野生物种并惠及穷人、农民和土著民众的生活。 举例来讲，在野生动植物濒危物种国际贸易公约框架下，安第斯山区的民众剪下小羊驼的细毛向世界其他地方的时尚奢侈行业出售。 喀麦隆人收集樱桃树皮出口欧洲制药企业。 而生活在不丹青藏高原上的民众��依靠向传统医药产业售卖虫草来维持生活。 但是在野生动植物濒危物种国际贸易公约框架外，确保合法贸易可持续并惠及穷人的指导性原则非常缺乏。 可持续贸易往往取决于贫困的农村民众在当地实行资源保护。 为了弄清楚实际状况，国际贸易中心（ITC）不久前对东南亚民众如何管理野生动植物濒危物种国际贸易公约规定的蟒蛇贸易进行了研究。 蟒蛇皮通常在时尚奢侈品行业被用作原材料，而国际贸易中心对越南和马来西亚蟒蛇皮采集者、农民和出口商的调查显示该贸易通过提供额外收入来源强化了当地民众的抗风险能力。 在越南，估计有1，000家家庭农场从事蟒蛇的养殖及贸易，而捕蛇在其他就业机会缺乏或因为宏观经济因素十分罕见的情况下为马来西亚的低技能、低收入工人提供了收入。 研究人员发现大部分蟒蛇捕猎者采用简单而有效的可持续管理计划，且该计划在减轻野生种群压力方面发挥了很大作用。 但蟒蛇皮像很多野生动物产品一样是一种商品，因此蟒蛇捕猎群体在如何增加附加值以提高收益方面是受到限制的。 秘鲁安第斯山区女性可以手工清理驼羊毛来换取每公斤增加50美元的收益，而售卖一条羊毛围巾则可以收入150到200美元；一张马来西亚蟒蛇皮售价为二百美元，而一个蟒蛇皮手袋却能以2，000美元的价格出售。 不过，某些新兴国家正在逐步加入价值链的上游，并因此增加在收益中所占的比例，这方面的例子有售卖羊驼呢和羊驼毛的秘鲁本土品牌Kuna，以及巴西天然化妆品品牌Natura。 偷猎、走私、不正当贸易许可和动物虐待是对合法野生动物贸易最大的威胁，所有这些都必须由监管机构和农村群体的利益相关者在当地层面加以解决。 幸运的是，只要农村群体愿意这样做，他们已经占据了保护野生动物最有利的地位。 在适当的环境下，野生动物关系到当地生产者利益（因为他们从野生动物合法贸易中受惠）的良性循环是确保可持续收益的最好 — — 而且有时也是唯一的 — — 长期解决办法。 为实现这一目标，政府可以扩大农民群体对资源及野生动物的使用权，以求使他们能以长远的眼光对自然资源进行管理和保护。 举例来讲，二十世纪七十年代秘鲁批准安第斯山脉民众有权使用驼羊毛挽救了濒于灭绝的驼羊并为当地民众创造了长期的新的收入流。 因为不同国家和群体的法律和自然环境千差万别，在各个部门实现类似的政策创新十分必要。 另外一个前景远大的部门是旅游，而且旅游业完全符合野生动植物濒危物种国际贸易公约的架构。 举一个例子，自从卢旺达开始与当地民众分享野生动物旅游的收入后，山地大猩猩的数量一直在增长。 我们一次又一次地看到，只要允许当地民众分享收益，他们可以成为坚定的野生动物捍卫者。 从更广义的角度讲，我们应当支持科学家研究新的适应性管理方法，并激励私营部门投资于扩大可持续采购以及加大供给 — — 还有生产链的透明度。 上面的例子表明，在保护的同时改善贫困农民生活不仅可行、甚至是相辅相成的。 只要强化政治意愿和明智投资，完成可持续发展目标为子孙后代减少贫困和保护野生动物的双重任务是完全可能的。 去年，联合国通过了一项解决野生动物非法贩卖问题的历史性决议，承认野生动植物濒危物种国际贸易公约合法构架的积极作用。 该决议呼吁野生动植物濒危物种国际贸易公约的182个成员国保护野生动物利益，同时实实在在地惠及贫困人口和农村群众。 我们希望参与世界野生动物大会的来自上述成员国的代表对这一呼吁表示认同。"

            "What’s the Crypto Regulation Endgame? CAMBRIDGE – With cryptocurrency prices plummeting as central banks start to raise interest rates, many are wondering if this is the beginning of the end of the bubble. Perhaps not yet. But a higher opportunity cost of money disproportionately drives down the prices of assets whose main uses lie in the future. Ultra-low interest rates flattered crypto, and young investors are now getting a taste of what happens when interest rates go up. A more interesting question is what will happen when governments finally get serious about regulating Bitcoin and its brethren. Of the major economies, only China has so far begun to do so. Most policymakers have instead tried to change the topic by talking about central bank-issued digital currencies (CBDCs). But this is something of a non sequitur. Although CBDCs are likely to include privacy features for small transactions, larger transactions will almost certainly require individuals to reveal their identity. In contrast, one of the biggest attractions of private cryptocurrencies is the opportunity they offer to bypass governments. True, cryptocurrency transactions are completely traceable through the blockchain ledger, but users typically set up accounts under pseudonyms and are therefore difficult to identify without other information, which is expensive to obtain. Some economists naively argue that there is no particular urgency to regulate Bitcoin and the like, because cryptocurrencies are difficult and costly to use for transactions. Try telling that to policymakers in developing economies, where crypto has become a significant vehicle for avoiding taxes, regulations, and capital controls. For poorer countries with limited state capacity, crypto is a growing problem. Citizens don’t need to be computer whizzes to circumvent the authorities. They can just access one of several simple “off-chain” exchanges. Although cryptocurrency transactions intermediated by a third party are in principle traceable, the exchanges are based in advanced economies. In practice, this makes the information virtually inaccessible to poor-country authorities under most circumstances. But isn’t this just crypto fulfilling its promise of helping citizens bypass corrupt, inefficient, and untrustworthy governments? Maybe, but, just like $100 bills, cryptocurrencies in the developing world are as likely to be used by malign actors as by ordinary citizens. For example, Venezuela is a major player in crypto markets, partly because expatriates use them to send money back and forth without it being seized by the country’s corrupt regime. But crypto is also surely used by the Venezuelan military in its drug-smuggling operations, not to mention by wealthy, politically connected individuals subject to financial sanctions. Given that the United States currently maintains financial sanctions on more than a dozen countries, hundreds of entities, and thousands of individuals, crypto is a natural refuge. One reason why advanced-economy regulators have been slow to act is the view that as long as cryptocurrency-related problems mainly affect the rest of the world, these problems are not their concern. Apparently buying into the idea that cryptocurrencies are essentially assets in which to invest – and that any transaction’s value is unimportant – the regulators are more worried about domestic investor protection and financial stability. But economic theory has long demonstrated that the value of any money ultimately depends on its potential underlying uses. The biggest investors in crypto may be in advanced economies, but the uses – and harms – have so far been mainly in emerging markets and developing economies. One might even argue that investing in some advanced-economy crypto vehicles is in a sense no different from investing in conflict diamonds. Advanced-economy governments will most likely find that the problems with cryptocurrencies eventually come home to roost. When that happens, they will be forced to institute a broad-based ban on digital currencies that do not permit users’ identities to be easily traced (unless, that is, technological advances ultimately strip away all vestiges of anonymity, in which case cryptocurrencies’ prices will collapse on their own). The ban would certainly have to extend to financial institutions and businesses, and would likely also include some restrictions on individuals. Such a step would sharply undercut today’s cryptocurrency prices by reducing liquidity. Of course, restrictions will be more effective the more countries apply them, but universal implementation is not required for significant local impact. Can some version of a ban be implemented? As China has demonstrated, it is relatively easy to shutter the crypto exchanges that the vast majority of people use for trading digital currencies. It is more difficult to prevent “on-chain” transactions, as the underlying individuals are harder to identify. Ironically, an effective ban on twenty-first-century crypto might also require phasing out (or at least scaling back) the much older device of paper currency, because cash is by far the most convenient way for people to “on-ramp” funds into their digital wallets without being easily detected. Just to be clear, I am not suggesting that all blockchain applications should be constrained. For example, regulated stablecoins, underpinned by a central-bank balance sheet, can still thrive, but there needs to be a straightforward legal mechanism for tracing a user’s identity if needed. When, if ever, might stiffer cryptocurrency regulation actually happen? Absent a crisis, it could take many decades, especially with major crypto players pouring huge sums into lobbying, much as the financial sector did in the runup to the 2008 global financial crisis. But it probably won’t take nearly that long. Unfortunately, the crypto crisis is likely to come sooner rather than later.",
            "加密货币监管终局何在？ 发自剑桥 — — 随着加密货币价格因央行开始加息而暴跌，许多人都在思考这是否就是泡沫结束的开端。 情况或许并非如此，但对于那些在未来才能发挥效用的资产来说，较高的货币机会成本会过度拉低其价格。 超低的利率曾让加密货币如鱼得水，如今年轻投资者们也开始尝到利率上升的滋味。 而一个更有趣的问题则是当政府最终认真监管比特币及其同类时会出现何种状况。 目前为止各主要经济体中只有中国着手这样做。 大多数政策制定者反而试图通过谈论中央银行发行的数字货币来转移话题。 但这是一种不合逻辑的说法。 虽然央行数字货币可能会顾及小笔交易的私密性，但较大金额的交易几乎肯定需要个人表明自身身份。 相比之下私人加密货币的最大吸引力之一就是它们提供了绕过政府的机会。 虽说加密货币交易完全可以通过区块链账本来追溯，但用户通常以会假名设立账户，因此在缺乏其他信息的情况下难以识别，更何况其他信息的获取成本还很高。 一些经济学家天真地认为对比特币及其同类的监管不存在特别的紧迫性，因为加密货币在交易中的使用难度和成本都很高。 但发展中经济体的政策制定者们或许对此不敢苟同 — — 在那些地方加密货币已成为规避税收、监管和资本管制的重要工具。 加密货币对那些国家能力有限的穷国来说是个日益严重的问题。 那些试图规避当局的公民不需要成为电脑高手，只需登录某些简单的“链下”交易所就能办到。 虽然由第三方中介的加密货币交易在原则上是可以追踪的，但这些交易所都位于发达经济体，因此在具体实践中穷国当局在大多数情况下都几乎无法获得这些信息。 那这不就是加密货币履行其协助公民绕过腐败、低效和失信政府的承诺吗？ 也许吧，但就像100美元钞票一样，发展中世界的加密货币既可能为普通公民所用，也可能成为恶意行为者的工具。 比如委内瑞拉就是加密货币市场的主要参与者，部分原因是外籍人士用它们汇款以免资金被该国腐败政权扣押。 但加密货币肯定也被委内瑞拉军方用于毒品走私行动，更不用说那些受到金融制裁且拥有政界关系的富人。 鉴于美国目前对十几个国家、数百个实体和数以千计的个人实施了金融制裁，加密货币已然成为了一个天然的避难所。 发达经济体监管机构行动迟缓的一个原因是觉得只要加密货币相关问题主要影响世界其他地区，那就不必关心。 显然，监管机构相信加密货币本质上是种投资（且其交易价值并不重要 ） ， 他们更关注的是国内投资者保护和金融稳定。 但经济学理论早已证明任何货币的价值最终都取决于其潜在基本用途。 加密货币的最大投资者可能身处发达经济体，但到目前为止其用途 — — 和危害 — — 主要在新兴市场和发展中经济体。 有人甚至说投资一些发达经济体的加密货币工具在某种意义上与投资血钻没什么区别。 先进经济体的政府很可能会发现加密货币的问题最终会蔓延到本国。 当这种情况发生时他们将被迫对那些不允许用户身份被轻易追踪的数字货币施以广泛的禁令（除非技术进步最终剥夺了所有残余的匿名性，在这种情况下加密货币的价格将自行崩溃 ） ， 该禁令肯定会延伸到金融机构和企业，可能还会包含对个人的一些限制。 这么一个做法将减少流动性从而大幅削弱当前的加密货币价格。 当然实施限制的国家越多限制自然也越有效，但普遍的实施并不一定会对当地产生重大影响。 那能否实施某种版本的禁令？ 正如中国所证明的那样，关闭绝大多数人用来交易数字货币的加密货币交易所是相对容易的。 阻止“链上”交易则更为困难，因为相关个人更难识别。 讽刺的是，要有效禁止21世纪的加密货币可能还需逐步淘汰（或至少减少）更古老的纸币，因为到目前为止现金依然是人们将资金“上链”到自己数字钱包且不被轻易发现的最便捷方式。 要明确说明的是，我并不是说所有区块链应用都应该受到限制。 比如受监管的稳定币仍可以在中央银行资产负债表的支持下蓬勃发展，但需要有一个清晰明了的法律机制去在必要时追踪用户身份。 那更严格的加密货币监管会在什么时候真正出台？ 如果不爆发危机的话这可能需要几十年的时间，尤其是在加密货币大玩家们投入巨额资金进行政治游说的情况下 — — 金融业在2008年全球金融危机之前也是这样干的。 但我认为大概不会花那么长时间，因为加密货币危机很可能会不幸地提早降临。"

            "Will American Populism Damage Japan? TOKYO – Thanks to his strong showing so far in the Democratic primary, US Senator Bernie Sanders is one of the frontrunners for the party’s nomination to face President Donald Trump in November. If Sanders does end up as the Democrats’ standard-bearer, this year’s presidential election will be a choice between his left-wing brand of populism and the right-wing variety espoused by Trump. For Japan, the potential implications of such a contest could be huge. Since taking office, Trump has consistently shunned multilateralism and pursued a divisive domestic agenda that is contributing to a further hardening of partisan attitudes in the United States. Sanders, meanwhile, seems to share Trump’s protectionist instincts regarding trade. Japanese political and business leaders are especially concerned by the decoupling of economic ties between America and China, the country’s two biggest trading partners. A breakdown in US-China trade relations, or a proliferation of protectionist measures around the world, would disrupt global supply chains and could have a devastating impact on Japan’s economy, the world’s third-largest. On China, Democrats don’t appear overwhelmingly different from Trump and the Republicans. Sanders (technically an independent) has blamed trade agreements for eliminating millions of US jobs, and has voted to pull the United States out of the WTO. And former Vice President Joe Biden, a moderate and now Sanders’s main rival for the Democratic nomination, has criticized the manner in which the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) was drafted, despite having previously promoted the deal. Nonetheless, Japan maintains some significant strengths. After Trump withdrew from the TPP in early 2017, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe led the pact’s remaining signatories to conclude the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) instead. And a free-trade deal between Japan and the European Union entered into force last year. Furthermore, Japan’s relatively high standing with the member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) boosts its chances of playing a greater global leadership role. In fact, one recent regional survey measuring perceptions of trust in major global powers found that Japan ranked well ahead of the EU, the US, China, and India. And among respondents who said they distrusted Japan, the most common reason given was that the country lacked the capacity or political will to act as a global leader. Japan therefore should build on the trust it enjoys within Southeast Asia, because closer ties with ASEAN are intrinsically valuable and will also better position Japan to engage with the EU. But if Japan is to become a more established vanguard of the rules-based multilateral order, it must act as a rule-shaper and proactive stabilizer. For example, Japan should seek to use its recent large trade deals as leverage to bring the post-Brexit United Kingdom into the CPTPP. At the same time, Japan should perhaps aim to extend its new relationship with the EU to the other CPTPP countries through another pact. This would require aligning CPTPP countries’ policies on critical issues such as data and climate change with those of the EU. In addition, Japan must help to conclude the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), a long-envisaged free-trade agreement between the ten ASEAN member countries and the six Indo-Pacific states (Australia, China, India, Japan, South Korea, and New Zealand). Such an effort will face headwinds, in particular India’s apparent reluctance to participate in negotiations. India’s withdrawal from the RCEP talks would be a major setback to the Abe government’s Free and Open Indo-Pacific strategy. For now, Japan must strive to ensure that India can eventually be included in the RCEP if conditions allow. Finally, Japan and China have agreed on the importance of principles such as transparency and debt sustainability with regard to infrastructure investment, which could provide a window for greater bilateral cooperation based on mutually accepted rules. Although the coronavirus will likely force a postponement of Chinese President Xi Jinping’s visit to Japan, the outbreak has heightened a sense of mutual vulnerability. Japanese authorities and companies have provided China with over two million masks, and Japan is expected to receive at leasta million in return from its neighbor. This “mask diplomacy” has had a stabilizing effect on bilateral ties. But although Japan has a wealth of opportunities to help strengthen the liberal international order as a rule-shaper, its ability to do so is still based on its cooperation with the US. And the future strength of that alliance will hinge heavily on how Americans vote come November. American populism’s gains, on both the left and the right, will further complicate the US-Japan alliance, thus restricting Japan’s role as a rule-shaper. In addition, Japanese policymakers currently must contend with Trump’s obstinacy on the issue of Japan’s host-nation support for US forces stationed in the country, with the administration appearing to press Japan for a massive increase. Democrats will most likely do the same. In fact, a victory for either Trump or Sanders will raise anxieties in Japan. The US, it is feared, may treat Japan as a strategic bargaining chip should Trump prevail, or grow even more inward-looking if Sanders does. The sort of polarizing populism exemplified by Trump, Sanders, and several other current world leaders may present Japan and the international order with their biggest challenge of the post-war era.",
            "美国民粹主义会伤及日本吗？ 东京—美国参议员伯尼·桑德斯（Bernie Sanders）在民主党初选中表现抢眼，是11月大选中民主党提名对抗总统特朗普的领跑者之一。 如果桑德斯果真成为民主党的旗手，那么今年的总统大选将在他的左翼民粹主义和特朗普的右翼民粹主义之间展开。 对日本而言，这场竞争的潜在影响是巨大的。 自上台以来，特朗普一直躲避多边主义，采取了进一步硬化美国党派态度的决定性的国内日程。 与此同时，桑德斯在贸易方面似乎与特朗普的保护主义本能颇有共同之处。 日本政治和商界领袖尤其担心美国和中国的经济脱钩，它们是日本最大的两个贸易伙伴。 美国和中国贸易关系的破裂，或者全球保护主义措施的兴起，将破坏全球供应链，给身为世界第三大经济体的日本带来破坏。 对于中国，民主党并未表现出与特朗普和共和党截然不同的态度。 桑德斯（理论上说是独立参选人）指责贸易协定让美国失去了数百万个工作岗位，支持美国退出世贸组织。 桑德斯目前的民主党提名主要竞争对手、前副总统乔·拜登（Joe Biden）态度较温和，但他也批评跨太平洋合作伙伴关系（TPP）草案的内容，尽管他此前大力兜售这一协议。 尽管如此，日本仍拥有一些重要优势。 2017年年初特朗普退出TPP后，日本首相安倍晋三领导协定的剩余签署国完成了跨太平洋合作伙伴关系全面进步协定（CPTPP ） 。 日本和欧盟的自由贸易协议也在去年生效。 此外，日本与东盟成员国关系也较好，这增加了它扮演更重要的全球领导角色的机会。 说说说，在一份衡量对全球主要力量的信任度的地区调查中，日本排名领先于欧盟、美国、中国和印度。 在表示不信任日本的受访者中，最常见的理由是日本缺乏担当全球领导者的能力或政治意愿。 因此，日本应该巩固其在东南亚所享有的信任，因为加紧与东盟的联系内在价值很高，也更有利于日本与欧盟的交往。 但如果日本想成为基于规则的多边秩序的稳定捍卫者，就必须成为规则制定者和积极的稳定器。 比如，日本应该寻求利用最近的大型贸易协议，将脱欧的英国拉入CPTPP。 与此同时，日本或许应该着眼于扩大与欧盟的新关系，通过新的契约将CPTPP国家也纳入进来。 这需要协调CPTPP国家在关键问题上的政策，如数据和气候变化等，使之与欧盟一致。 此外，日本必须帮助完成十个东盟成员国与六个印度洋-太平洋国家（澳大利亚、中国、印度、日本、韩国和新西兰）之间的远见卓识的自由贸易协定地区全面经济合作伙伴关系（RCEP ） 。 这些举措将面临阻力，特别是印度很明显不愿意参与谈判。 印度退出RCEP谈判将是对安倍政府自由而开放的印度洋-太平洋战略的重大打击。 目前，日本必须尽力确保印度在条件允许的情况下最终参与到RCEP中来。 最后，日本和中国在一些原则的重要性上达成了一致，比如基础设施投资的透明度和债务可持续性等，这可以作为基于互相接受的规则的更自由的合作的机会窗口。 尽管冠状病毒可能迫使中国国家主席习近平无法访问日本，但疫情也突显出共患难。 日本当局和公司向中国提供了两百多万只口罩，而中国预计也将回馈至少一百万只。 这一“口罩外交”对双边关系起到了稳定作用。 但是，尽管日本有大量机会作为规则制定者帮助加强自由国际秩序，但其能力仍基于与美国的合作。 这一联盟关系未来的强度将严重取决于11月的美国大选结果。 美国民粹主义的得势，不管是左翼还是右翼，都将让美日联盟复杂化，进而限制日本作为规则制定者的角色。 此外，日本决策者现在必须反对特朗普在日本对驻日美军的支持问题上的顽固态度，特朗普政府在施压日本大幅提高支持力度。 民主党很有可能也会这么做。 事实上，不管是特朗普还是桑德斯获胜，都会引起日本的焦虑。 日本担心，特朗普胜出，美国会把日本当成战略讨价还价的筹码，而如果桑德斯当选，美国会变得更加内向。 以特朗普、桑德斯和其他一些当今世界领导人为代表的极化的民粹主义可能给日本和国际社会造成战后时代最大的挑战。"

            "Will Banks and Financial Markets Recover in 2009? NEW YORK – Global financial markets in 2008 experienced their worst crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930’s. Major financial institutions went bust; others were bought up on the cheap or survived only after major bailouts. Global stock markets fell by more than 50%; interest-rate spreads skyrocketed; a severe liquidity and credit crunch appeared; and many emerging-market economies staggered to the International Monetary Fund for help. So what lies ahead in 2009? Is the worst behind us or ahead of us? To answer these questions, we must understand that a vicious circle of economic contraction and worsening financial conditions is underway. The United States will certainly experience its worst recession in decades, a deep and protracted contraction lasting about 24 months through the end of 2009. Moreover, the entire global economy will contract. There will be recession in the euro zone, the United Kingdom, Continental Europe, Canada, Japan, and the other advanced economies. There is also a risk of a hard landing for emerging-market economies, as trade, financial, and currency links transmit real and financial shocks to them. In the advanced economies, recession had brought back earlier in 2008 fears of 1970’s-style stagflation (a combination of economic stagnation and inflation). But, with aggregate demand falling below growing aggregate supply, slack goods markets will lead to lower inflation as firms’ pricing power is restrained. Likewise, rising unemployment will control labor costs and wage growth. These factors, combined with sharply falling commodity prices, will cause inflation in advanced economies to ease toward the 1% level, raising concerns about deflation, not stagflation. Deflation is dangerous as it leads to a liquidity trap: nominal policy rates cannot fall below zero, so monetary policy becomes ineffective. Falling prices mean that the real cost of capital is high and the real value of nominal debts rise, leading to further declines in consumption and investment – and thus setting in motion a vicious circle in which incomes and jobs are squeezed further, aggravating the fall in demand and prices. As traditional monetary policy becomes ineffective, other unorthodox policies will continue to be used: policies to bail out investors, financial institutions, and borrowers; massive provision of liquidity to banks in order to ease the credit crunch; and even more radical actions to reduce long-term interest rates on government bonds and narrow the spread between market rates and government bonds. Today’s global crisis was triggered by the collapse of the US housing bubble, but it was not caused by it. America’s credit excesses were in residential mortgages, commercial mortgages, credit cards, auto loans, and student loans. There was also excess in the securitized products that converted these debts into toxic financial derivatives; in borrowing by local governments; in financing for leveraged buyouts that should never have occurred; in corporate bonds that will now suffer massive losses in a surge of defaults; in the dangerous and unregulated credit default swap market. Moreover, these pathologies were not confined to the US. There were housing bubbles in many other countries, fueled by excessive cheap lending that did not reflect underlying risks. There was also a commodity bubble and a private equity and hedge funds bubble. Indeed, we now see the demise of the shadow banking system, the complex of non-bank financial institutions that looked like banks as they borrowed short term and in liquid ways, leveraged a lot, and invested in longer term and illiquid ways. As a result, the biggest asset and credit bubble in human history is now going bust, with overall credit losses likely to be close to a staggering $2 trillion. Thus, unless governments rapidly recapitalize financial institutions, the credit crunch will become even more severe as losses mount faster than recapitalization and banks are forced to contract credit and lending. Equity prices and other risky assets have fallen sharply from their peaks of late 2007, but there are still significant downside risks. An emerging consensus suggests that the prices of many risky assets – including equities – have fallen so much that we are at the bottom and a rapid recovery will occur. But the worst is still ahead of us. In the next few months, the macroeconomic news and earnings/profits reports from around the world will be much worse than expected, putting further downward pressure on prices of risky assets, because equity analysts are still deluding themselves that the economic contraction will be mild and short. While the risk of a total systemic financial meltdown has been reduced by the actions of the G-7 and other economies to backstop their financial systems, severe vulnerabilities remain. The credit crunch will get worse; deleveraging will continue, as hedge funds and other leveraged players are forced to sell assets into illiquid and distressed markets, thus causing more price falls and driving more insolvent financial institutions out of business. A few emerging-market economies will certainly enter a full-blown financial crisis. So 2009 will be a painful year of global recession and further financial stresses, losses, and bankruptcies. Only aggressive, coordinated, and effective policy actions by advanced and emerging-market countries can ensure that the global economy recovers in 2010, rather than entering a more protracted period of economic stagnation.",
            "银行和金融市场会在2009年复苏吗？ 纽约—2008年的全球金融市场经历了自从二十世纪三十年代大萧条以来最严重的危机。 有许多大型金融机构破产，另外一些以非常低廉的价格被收购或者在巨额融资后方才得以生存。 全球股票市场下跌超过50 % ， 利率差急剧扩大，出现了严重的流动性和信用紧缩，还有许多新兴市场经济体不得不向国际货币基金组织求助。 那么2009年的情况会怎样呢？ 最糟糕的时候是已经过去了还是尚未到来？ 要回答这些问题，我们必须认识到经济紧缩的恶性循环和持续恶化的财政状况还远未结束。 美国可能会经历几十年来最严重的衰退。 严重并且漫长的经济紧缩可能将持续24个月，直至2009年底。 此外，整个全球经济也将步入衰退，欧元区、英国、欧洲大陆、加拿大、日本和其他发达经济体都将出现衰退。 新兴市场经济体存在硬着陆的风险，因为贸易、金融和货币联系将把实际的金融动荡传导给它们。 而在发达经济体中，早在2008年初人们就担心衰退会引发二十世纪七十年代出现的那种经济滞胀（经济停滞和通货膨胀的合称 ） 。 但是，由于总需求低于不断增长的总供应量，疲软的商品市场将因为企业的定价能力受到限制而使通货膨胀得以缓解。 同样地，失业率的上升将限制劳动力成本和工资的增长。 这些因素，加上急剧下降的商品价格，将使发达经济体的通货膨胀下跌到1%的水平，从而使人们担心会出现通货紧缩而不是滞胀。 通货紧缩是非常危险的，因为它会导致流动性陷阱：名义政策利率不可能降到零以下，因此货币政策将失去效力。 商品价格的不断下降意味着资本的实际成本非常高并且名义债务的实际价值提高了，这将导致消费和投资的进一步下滑，从而引发恶性循环：收入和就业机会进一步萎缩，从而加剧了需求和商品价格的下滑。 由于传统的货币政策失去效力，其他一些非传统的政策将继续被使用：帮助投资者、金融机构和借贷者摆脱困境，向银行注入巨额的流动资金以缓解信用紧缩，甚至采取更加激进的行动以降低政府债券的长期利率和缩小市场利率与政府债券之间的利差。 今天的全球危机是由美国房地产泡沫的破灭触发的，但是它并不是这场危机的根源。 美国的信用发放过度存在于住房抵押、商业抵押、信用卡、车贷和学生贷款中。 此外将这些债务转化为有害的金融衍生产品的证券化产品、地方政府的借款、向本不该发生的杠杆收购提供的融资、由于违约现象的大量发生现在可能将遭受巨额损失的公司债以及危险并且缺少监管的信用违约掉期市场都存在过多过滥的状况。 此外，这些病症并不仅仅存在于美国。 其他许多国家因为不能反应潜在风险的低息贷款的泛滥而引发了房地产市场的泡沫。 此外还有商品泡沫及私募股权和对冲基金的泡沫。 事实上，我们现在看到了影子银行系统的倒台以及非银行金融机构的复杂性。 这些金融机构看上去像是银行，因为它们拆借短期资金，然后以流动性方式进行大量的杠杆收购和长期及非流动性的投资。 其结果是，人类历史上最大的资产和信用泡沫现在正在破灭，总信用损失很可能将接近2万亿美元。 在这种情况下，除非各国政府迅速向金融机构注资，随着损失增加的速度快于再资本化的速度以及银行被迫紧缩信用和贷款，信用紧缩将变得更加严重。 股权价格和其他风险资产的价格自2007年下半年达到最高点以来急剧下降，但是依然还存在大幅下降的风险。 有一种共识是鉴于许多风险资产的价格，包括股权价格，已经下降如此之多，市场现在已经处于底部并且将很快出现快速反弹。 但是最糟糕的时候还远未到来。 接下来几个月，世界各地出台的宏观经济消息和收入/利润报告将比预想的更糟糕，从而给风险资产价格带来更大的下行压力，因为股权分析师还在自欺欺人地说经济紧缩是温和的并且短暂的。 尽管发生系统性的金融危机的风险由于七国集团和其他经济体采取行动支持它们的金融体系而被减小了，但是依然存在相当大的脆弱性。 信用紧缩将变得更严重；去杠杆化的行动将会继续，因为对冲基金和其他杠杆化玩家被迫将资产出售给流动性较差和低迷的市场，从而导致价格进一步下滑以及使更多无力清偿债务的金融机构破产。 一些新兴市场经济体可能将陷入全面爆发的金融危机。 因此2009年将会是全球衰退的痛苦一年，财政压力、损失和破产将会进一步加剧。 只有发达经济体和新兴市场经济体采取强有力、协同并且有效的政策行动，才能确保全球经济在2010年复苏，而不是进入一个更加漫长的经济滞胀期。"

            "Europe’s Unending Berlusconi Problem LONDON – Silvio Berlusconi, Italy’s three-time prime minister and the country’s dominant politician for two decades, has now been convicted and sentenced to four years in prison – a sentence since reduced to one year. But few people in Italy – or in Europe – believe that Berlusconi will fade from Italian, or European, politics anytime soon. Just a few days ago, he declared his intention to remain involved in politics, though not to run for prime minister a fourth time. Whatever role Berlusconi chooses to play, it is unlikely to be a marginal one. He may not wish to be king again, but he certainly can be a kingmaker, owing to his control of Mediaset, Italy’s largest media group. And, given his abysmal popularity ratings, he may decide to play the wild card, embrace a euro-skeptic and anti-government stance, and try to bring down Prime Minister Mario Monti’s technocratic administration. Monti’s government took over from Berlusconi in November 2011, arriving with a clear mandate, and full parliamentary support, to implement the measures needed to restore market confidence and reassure Italy’s eurozone partners and the International Monetary Fund that the country was not going down the path taken by Greece. At the time of the G-20 summit in Cannes that month, Italy – and Europe – was dangerously close to collapse, with Berlusconi’s government deeply divided about the fiscal measures needed to bring down the country’s debt-service costs. Domestic political deadlock, and Berlusconi’s inability to engage with Germany and France resulted in spiraling refinancing costs, with the spread relative to German bunds consistently over 500 basis points between July and November 2011. The Monti government has restored market confidence and Italy’s international credibility. But the overall picture remains fragile. The interest-rate spread has stabilized around a more manageable 300 basis points, but is still higher than it was three years ago. In addition, Italy’s economic outlook remains highly uncertain. Indeed, the modest economic recovery that should benefit many countries in 2013 seems to be eluding Italy. According to the IMF, the economy will remain in recession next year, and, though the rate of contraction will be less severe than in 2012 (-0.7% in 2013, compared to -2.3% this year), the unemployment rate is expected to rise further, from 10.6% to 11.1%. More needs to be done in order to support economic growth in the short term, improve the country’s fiscal position in the medium term, and implement the structural reforms needed to make the Italian economy more robust and internationally competitive in the long term. Italy is ranked 43rd in the World Economic Forum’s global competitiveness index, well below the main eurozone countries, owing to lack of investment – especially in human capital – and structural rigidities that have constrained growth for many years. The answer to Italy’s economic problems is not, as Berlusconi advocates, an exit from the eurozone and a return to the flexibility of its own currency, which in the past allowed policymakers to boost competitiveness through irresponsible devaluations. Italy needs to learn how to live with the euro and within the eurozone, which means adopting policies that ensure that productivity growth and innovation, not currency devaluation, are the main drivers of competitiveness. A stable, competent, and responsible government with a comfortable parliamentary majority is essential to continue what Monti’s government has initiated. While the odds still favor a relatively smooth transition, many uncertainties could derail the reform process. In particular, whether Italy will be able to move beyond technocratic politics to a “normal” government remains the outstanding question both at home and for the other eurozone member states. From this perspective, what Berlusconi advocates for Italy, and the consequences of his agenda for the eurozone, is not good news. Any hint that the country may be locked again in parliamentary inertia, as in the final months of Berlusconi’s last government, would push the markets to question the credibility of Italy’s fiscal-consolidation plan, jeopardizing the country’s ability to refinance its debt. That debt is the largest in the eurozone – at roughly €2 trillion ($2.6 trillion), or 120% of the country’s GDP – which means that Italy can be helped, but not rescued. With potential instability looming, Monti should ensure that Italy is not defenseless in the event of another round of market instability. Unlike some months ago, now the European Central Bank can intervene and buy troubled countries’ debt. But this mechanism can be activated only by formal request. Italy should follow this route without delay. It is better to have a powerful weapon that may gather dust than to be unarmed in a time of need.",
            "欧洲未完的贝卢斯科尼问题 伦敦—二十年来意大利最主要政客、三度出任总理的贝卢斯科尼如今被判四年监禁，此后又被减刑为一年。 但在意大利（或者说在欧洲）几乎没人相信贝卢斯科尼会马上从意大利或欧洲政坛上消失。 就在几天前，他宣布无意退出政坛，尽管他也不会追求第四次总理生涯。 不管贝卢斯科尼选择扮演什么角色，肯定不会是边缘角色。 他可能不再原因充当国王，但显然还可以成为拥立国王的人，因为他是意大利最大传媒集团Mediaset的控制着。 此外，由于他支持率极低，他可能会选择使出王牌，采取质疑欧元和反对政府的立场，并试图推翻总理蒙蒂的技术官僚政府。 蒙蒂政府于2011年11月取代贝卢斯科尼，在议会的一直支持下，以鲜明的立场实施了重振市场信心、保证意大利欧元区成员国地位、向IMF表明意大利不会像希腊那样堕落到底的措施。 当月戛纳举行G20峰会时，意大利（以及欧洲）岌岌可危，而贝卢斯科尼政府在减少意大利债务利息支付负担所必须的政策方面分裂为两个阵营。 国内政治僵局，加上再融资成本增加导致贝卢斯科尼无法与德国和法国合作，导致意大利国债相对德国国债的利差在2011年7月—11月间一直保持在500个基点以上。 蒙蒂政府已经重塑了市场信心和意大利的国际信誉。 但整体状况依然脆弱。 利差稳定在较易控制的300个基点的水平，但仍比三年前要高。 此外，意大利经济前景仍高度不确定。 事实上，预计在2013年给众多国家带来好处的温和经济复苏似乎不会光临意大利。 根据IMF的预测，意大利经济明年将继续衰退，尽管衰退不会像2012年那样严重（2013年经济增长将为-0.7 % ， 而今年将为-2.3 % ） ，而失业率将进一步从10.6%升至11.1 % 。 意大利需要采取进一步行动以支持短期经济增长、改善中期财政状况，并采取结构性改革以保证意大利经济在长期更加稳健和具有国际竞争力。 意大利在经合组织全球竞争力排名中名列第43，与主要欧元区国家相去甚远，这主要是由于投资不足（特别是人力资本方面的投资）以及约束增长多年的结构性僵化造成的。 意大利经济问题的答案并不是如贝卢斯科尼所鼓吹的退出欧元区、回归更加灵活的本国货币等在过去能让政客用不负责任的贬值提振竞争力的老办法。 意大利需要学习如何与欧元共存，如何在欧元区内生存，这意味着采取保证生产率增长和创新而不是货币贬值的政策，这才是提振竞争力的主要动力。 稳定、胜任而负责的政府以及一个满意的议会多数是维持蒙蒂政府措施的关键。 尽管相对平稳的转型仍是最可能发生的情景，但不确定性仍可能妨碍改革过程。 特别是，意大利是否能够打破官僚政治的藩篱，回到“正常”政府上来仍是其国内和其他欧元区成员国关注的悬而未决的问题。 从这个角度看，贝卢斯科尼建议意大利做的，以及他的欧元区日程表的后果，对意大利来说都不是好消息。 意大利可能再次陷入贝卢斯科尼上届政府最后几个月的议会僵局的风险将使市场质疑意大利财政整合计划的可信度，妨碍意大利再融资其债务的能力。 而这笔债务是欧元区中最大的一笔 — — 大约2万亿欧元，或相当于其GDP的120 % — —这意味着意大利只能被帮助，不能被救助。 在潜在的动荡面前，蒙蒂应该确保意大利不会再新一轮市场动荡前束手无策。 与几个月前不同，如今欧洲央行可以干预并购买受困国的债务。 但这一机制被激活是有正式条件的。 意大利应该毫不迟疑地朝这个方向前进。 在这个节骨眼上，宁可获得有力武器而任其蒙尘，也不应该赤手空拳。"

            "Will Britain Choose Irrelevance? LONDON – When voters in the United Kingdom go to the polls on June 23 to decide whether their country should leave the European Union, the issues they will have to reckon with will include the impact of their decision on unemployment, trade flows, and the stability of financial markets. But there are other less quantifiable considerations that must also be weighed in the balance. The economic arguments against a British exit from the EU – or Brexit – have been well rehearsed. Many have suggested that if the UK were to leave, manufacturers would secure continued access to the European market by fleeing across the English Channel, costing the country millions of jobs. Similarly, withdrawal from the EU risks undermining London’s position as a global financial center, which depends on the city’s integration into European markets. Trade agreements, too, would have to be renegotiated in the wake of a Brexit. Another area of concern for many voters regards the UK’s sovereignty – the idea that independent countries should have ultimate decision-making authority over what happens within their borders. Membership in the EU sometimes requires ceding control to a complex web of often-inefficient Brussels-based supranational institutions. I hold a doctorate in economics and work with businesses whose employees and operations benefit from the UK’s membership in the EU. I also have a pronounced disdain for red tape and inefficiency. And yet I do not believe that economic considerations or concerns about sovereignty offer compelling arguments for Brexit. Much more important is the potential impact of such a decision on the UK’s global standing. Membership in a European community of 500 million people provides the UK with considerable influence over geopolitics and the global economy. As the world becomes ever more daunting and complex, maintaining that influence is clearly in the country’s interest. The referendum campaign is playing out against a global economic and political backdrop that is nothing if not foreboding. The International Monetary Fund has warned that global growth is unlikely to return to the levels that it attained before the 2008 financial crisis. Indeed, the global consulting firm McKinsey predicts that global growth rates during the next 50 years will be half of what they were over the previous five decades. Meanwhile, Martin Dempsey, a retired army general and former Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, has said that the world has entered the most dangerous period he has ever witnessed. Developing countries are home to roughly 90% of the world’s population, and some two-thirds of their residents are younger than 25. Stagnant growth or shrinking output in many emerging economies has serious consequences. The UK’s Overseas Development Institute predicts that by 2025, roughly 80% of the world’s poor will live in fragile states. Job-eroding technological advances, worsening income inequality, demographic shifts, dwindling natural resources, and environmental depletion are adding even more straws to the camel’s back. The world is already undergoing the worst refugee crisis since the end of World War II, with some 60 million people having been driven from their homes. The mounting instability will only exacerbate the problem. Leaving the EU will not shield the UK from the vagaries of the global economy. It will only deprive the country of a leading voice in shaping the response to new and existing challenges. The UK is far better placed to influence the global policy agenda from inside the EU than from outside it. To be sure, leaving the EU would not strip the UK of its historical prominence in international organizations – most notably its permanent membership of the United Nations’ Security Council. But a non-European Britain would be less likely to secure the same standing and influence in whatever institutions emerge in the years ahead. Within the EU, the UK is a critical part of an influential economic and political bloc with undeniable heft. Amplified by the EU, its voice can influence world events, providing the country with what the British like to describe as an ability to punch above its weight. Should the UK leave, however, its influence would be limited to its true size on the global stage: a relatively small country with limited economic and political power. As British voters prepare to cast their ballots, they should weigh carefully the consequences of international irrelevance.",
            "英国会选择边缘化吗？ 伦敦—6月23日，当英国选民来到投票箱前，决定是否要让祖国脱离欧元区时，他们必须考虑的一个问题是他们的决定对失业、贸易流和金融市场稳定的影响。 但其他不太能够量化的考虑也必须进行权衡。 反对英国退出欧盟（简称英国退出）的经济理由早已耳熟能详。 许多人认为，如果英国脱离欧盟，制造业必须越过英吉利海峡进入欧洲市场，导致英国损失数百万工作岗位。 类似地，退出欧盟有可能破坏伦敦的全球金融中心地位，这一地位依赖英国融入欧洲市场。 贸易协定也必须在英国退出后重新谈判。 对许多选民来说，另一个忧虑是英国的主权 — — 即独立国家对于发生在其疆界内的事物应该拥有最终决定权的思想。 欧盟成员国地位有时需要向位于布鲁塞尔，常常效率低下的复杂的超国家机构网络让渡一些控制权。 我拥有经济学博士学位，并与一些员工和经营活动因为英国的欧盟成员国地位而收益的企业合作。 我也相当鄙视官样文章和低效率。 但我并不认为经济考虑或对主权的担忧是英国退出问题最主要的原因。 比这些因素重要得多的是这一决定对英国全球地位的潜在影响。 加入到拥有5亿人口的欧洲社会能让英国拥有对地缘政治和全球经济的可观的影响力。 随着世界变得越来越可怕和复杂，保持这一影响力显然符合英国的利益。 全民公决是在一个全球经济和政治背景下进行的，这一背景带来了不祥的预兆。 国际货币基金组织（IMF）警告全球经济不可能回到2008年金融危机前的水平。 事实上，全球咨询公司麦肯锡预测，未来50年全球增长率将只有此前五十年的一半。 与此同时，退休陆军上将、前美国参谋长联合会议主席马丁·邓普西（Martin Dempsey）说，世界已经进入了他所见过的最危险的时期。 发展中国家占据了世界人口的90%左右，并且其中三分之二的居民年龄不到25岁。 许多新兴经济体的增长停滞或产出萎缩产生了严重后果。 英国海外发展研究所（Overseas Development Institute）预测，到2025年，80%的世界人口将生活在脆弱国家。 减少工作岗位的技术进步、恶化的收入不平等、人口变化、日益遭到破坏的自然资源和环境耗竭给骆驼压上了更多的稻草。 世界正在经历二战结束以来最严重的难民危机，大约6,000万人被迫流离失所。 日益严重的动荡将进一步恶化问题。 脱离欧盟无法将英国隔离在全球经济的变幻莫测之外。 这样将剥夺英国在制定新旧挑战应对方案上的领导权。 对英国来说，从欧盟内部影响全球政策日程比从外部要有利得多。 诚然，脱离欧盟不会影响欧盟在国际组织中的历史主导地位 — — 最显著的便是联合国安理会常任理事国地位。 但不属于欧洲的英国在今后新���现的任何机构中拥有同样地位和影响力的可能性降低了。 在欧盟内部，英国是影响力毋庸置疑的经济和政治集团的关键部分。 通过欧盟的放大，英国的声音能够左右世界事件，给英国带来英国人常说的超越国家实力的能力。 但是，如果英国脱离欧盟，其影响力将限于其在世界舞台上真正规模：一个相对较小的、经济和政治实力有限的国家。 在英国选民准备投票之际，他们应该仔细掂量国际边缘化的后果。"

            "Will Cap-and-Trade Incite Protectionism? CAMBRIDGE ­– There is a serious danger that the international adoption of cap-and-trade legislation to limit carbon-dioxide emissions will trigger a new round of protectionist measures. While aimed at reducing long-term environmental damage, cap-and-trade policies could produce significant harmful economic effects in the near term that would continue into the future. Scientific evidence appears to indicate that the accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere from the burning of fossil fuels (primarily coal, oil, and natural gas) – mainly in electricity production, transportation, and various industrial processes – contributes to gradual global warming, with long-term adverse effects on living conditions around the world. It is with this in mind that representatives of more than 150 countries are scheduled to meet in Copenhagen in December to discuss ways to reduce CO2 emissions. A common suggestion is to impose a tax on all CO2 emissions, which would be levied on companies that emit CO2 in production, or that sell products like gasoline that cause CO2 emissions when used. Such a tax would cause electricity companies and industrial firms to adopt techniques that reduce their CO2 emissions, as long as the cost of doing so is less than the tax that they would otherwise have to pay. The higher cost of production incurred to reduce emissions – and of any emissions tax still due – would, of course, be included in the price charged to consumers. Consumers would respond to the tax-induced increase in the cost of the emissions-intensive products by reducing their consumption of those goods and services in favor of goods and services that create smaller amounts of CO2 emissions. A carbon tax causes each firm and household to respond to the same cost of adding CO2 to the atmosphere. That uniform individual cost incentive allows total CO2 to be reduced at a lower total cost than would be achieved by a variety of administrative requirements, such as automobile mileage standards, production technology standards (e.g., minimum renewable fuel inputs in electricity generation), etc. Yet we do not see carbon taxes being adopted. Although governments levy taxes on gasoline, they are reluctant to impose a general carbon tax because of public opposition to any form of taxation. Governments have therefore focused on a cap-and-trade system as a way of increasing the cost of CO2-intensive products without explicitly imposing a tax. In a cap-and-trade system, the government sets total allowable national emissions of CO2 per year and requires any firm that causes CO2 emissions to have a permit per ton of CO2 emitted. If the government sells these permits in an auction, the price of the permit would be a cost to the firm in the same way as a carbon tax – and with the same resulting increases in consumer prices. The cap-and-trade system thus imposes a carbon tax without having to admit that it is really a tax. A cap-and-trade system can cause serious risks to international trade. Even if every country has a cap-and-trade system and all aim at the same relative reduction in national CO2 emissions, the resulting permit prices will differ because of national differences in initial CO2 levels and in domestic production characteristics. Because the price of the CO2 permits in a country is reflected in the prices of its products, the cap-and-trade system affects its international competitiveness. When the permit prices become large enough to have a significant effect on CO2 emissions, there will be political pressure to introduce tariffs on imports that offset the advantage of countries with low permit prices. Such offsetting tariffs would have to differ among products (being higher on more CO2-intensive products) and among countries (being higher for countries with low permit prices). Such a system of complex differential tariffs is just the kind of protectionism that governments have been working to eliminate since the start of the GATT process more than 50 years ago. Worse still, cap-and-trade systems in practice do not rely solely on auctions to distribute the emissions permits. The plan working its way through the United States Congress (the Waxman-Markey bill) would initially give away 85% of the permits, impose a complex set of regulatory policies, and allow companies to buy CO2 offsets (e.g., by paying for the planting of trees) instead of reducing their emissions or buying permits. Such complexities make it impossible to compare the impact of CO2 policies among countries, which in turn would invite those who want to protect domestic jobs to argue for higher tariff levels. There is no easy answer to this problem. But before rushing to impose tariffs, it is important to remember that cap-and-trade policies would not be the only government source of differences in competitiveness. Better roads, ports, and even schools all contribute to a country’s competitiveness. No one attempts to use tariffs to balance those government-created differences in competitiveness, and there should be no such attempts if a cap-and-trade system is introduced. If an international agreement to impose a cap-and-trade scheme is adopted in Copenhagen, the countries there should agree as well that there will be no attempt to introduce offsetting tariffs that would ultimately threaten our global system of free trade.",
            "“总量管制和排放交易 ” （ CAP-AND-TRADE）制度会引发贸易保护主义么？ 剑桥 — — 目前，关于“总量管制和排放交易”在国际间被广泛接受，很有可能引发新一轮的贸易保护主义。 而且在近期乃至将来对经济造成非常不好的影响。 “总量管制和排放交易”是为了限制二氧化碳的排放而制定的一项立法，目的是限制碳排放量对环境的长期危害。 科学证据表明：由于燃料化石（主要是煤，石油和天然气 ） — —主要是用于发电，运输和各种工业化等 — — 在空气中的大量燃烧，使得二氧化碳在大气层中的含量不断升高，迫使全球气候变暖，由此威胁到我们生活的环境。 因此，今年12月，全球150多个国家的代表将在哥本哈根聚集，共同讨论如何减少二氧化碳的排放量问题。 如何解决这一难题呢？ 目前一种普遍的解决方案是对于二氧化碳的排放实施税收管制，也就是说针对那些由于生产环节而产生二氧化碳的企业，或是产品本身（例如汽油）的使用导致二氧化碳排放的企业增加税收。 目的是使得电力公司和其他工业企业改进工艺，减少二氧化碳的排放，只要是税金的数额高于工业改造的成本，他们就会选择后者。 如果对生产企业加增赋税 — — 目前这些税种还没有开始实施 — — 必然的结果就是，这些负担将会被转嫁到消费者头上。 而由于产品价格的升高，消费者自然也会因此减少购买这些产品，转而购买那些排放二氧化碳较少的产品和服务。 同样的，每一个家庭和公司都会受到排放税的影响。 政府可以通过行政的手段，迫使个人消费者减少二氧化碳的排放量，这如同汽车里程标准和其他一些产品技术标准（例如，在电动机中，有最小可再生汽油消耗量的标准。 ）一样。 然而，目前我们并没有看到碳附加税的出台。 虽然汽油有附加税，考虑到公众的反对态度，政府不大可能采用一般碳附加税的做法。 于是，政府采用了“总量管制和排放交易”系统来提高和二氧化碳相关产品的成本，以此来达到收税的一样的目的。 在“总量管制和排放交易”系统中，政府对国家每年可以排放二氧化碳的总量给出一个标准，对那些排放二氧化碳的公司，要求他们领取一定的执照。 政府再对这些牌照进行竞价拍卖，如此一来，这些公司将会增加一定的成本，就如同碳税收一样 — — 变相提高了产品的价格。 “总量管制和排放交易”系统实际上就相当于一种税收，只是不这么称呼而已。 “总量管制和排放交易”系统对国际贸易中有着非常严重的危害。 即使为了减少本国的碳排放量，世界上每个国家都有采取“总量管制和排放交易”系统。 但由于各个国家的不同的二氧化碳水平排放水平以及国内产品上的差异性，每个国家的碳排放的执照价格就会不同， 由此影响到相对应产品的价格，从而影响到该产品在国际上的竞争力。 当执照的价格对二氧化碳的排放量影响力足够大时，国内就会有政治上的呼吁，要求对那些牌照费用较低国家的产品增收进口关税。 这些关税也会因产品而异（排放二氧化碳越多的产品征收税额会越高 ） 。 这种复杂的税收体制其实就是各国政府的一种贸易保护主义措施，这种贸易保护主义早在50年前的关税贸易总协定中就已经被禁止使用。 更为糟糕的是 ， “ 总量管制和排放交易”系统在实际操作中不仅仅是通过竞价拍卖来发放牌照。 例如，美国国会通过实行一个复杂的立法政策，要求相关企业通过抵消二氧化碳的排放量（例如，栽种一定数量的树木的做法 ） ， 来获得85%的排放执照。 如此复杂的系统将无法和其他国家的排放执照的费用加以比较。 这样就会给那些想要保护本国就业机会的国家提供一定的借口，实施对外来产品的关税。 看来，问题的解决远没有那么简单。 在忙于推出关税之前，我们还应该知道，除了“总量管制和排放交易”系统，各国政府还有其他手段来提高本国的竞争力。 完善本国的公路，港口，甚至是建立较好的学校都能增加一个国家的竞争力。 我们不愿意看到政府用关税手段来影响产品的国际竞争力，这同样也违背了“总量管制和排放交易”系统的初衷。 如果在本次哥本哈根会议上 ， “ 总量管制和排放交易”系统能够得以通过。 与会的国家还应该保证不会采用关税壁垒的手段，因为这将关乎到全球自由贸易系统的生死存亡。"

            "Will Chemical Weapons Be Used in Ukraine? LONDON – Russia has claimed, without evidence, that the United States is operating biowarfare laboratories in Ukraine. The US has dismissed the allegations as “preposterous,” and – along with NATO leaders – warned that the Kremlin might be seeking to manufacture a pretext for using chemical or biological weapons in its flailing military assault against its neighbor. Ukraine has previously said that, like many other countries, it has public-health laboratories dedicated to researching how to mitigate the threats of dangerous diseases affecting animals and humans. On March 11, the United Nations Security Council met at Russia’s request to address the issue, but Russia was again unable to provide any credible proof of its allegations. The UN Secretariat briefed the UNSC members on the 1975 Biological Weapons Convention, and referred to the possibility of using a consultation mechanism when there are doubts about compliance. Under the circumstances, it is unlikely that such consultations could take place between Russia and Ukraine. The World Health Organization, evidently giving more credence to Ukraine’s side of the story, has advised the country to destroy highly dangerous pathogens in its public-health labs in order to prevent their accidental release as a result of the fighting. But what about chemical weapons? In assessing the risk of their use in Ukraine, we should recall key recent events, particularly in Syria, where chemical weapons were used on multiple occasions during the country’s civil war. In September 2013, the UN Secretary-General’s Mechanism – triggered by then-Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on the basis of prohibitions contained in the 1925 Geneva Protocol – determined that the nerve agent Sarin had been used the previous month in Ghouta, on the outskirts of Damascus. The attack caused more than 1,400 civilian deaths. Following an agreement between Russia and the US, Syria agreed to give up its chemical weapons and joined the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) in October 2013. This meant that Syria became subject to the scrutiny of the comprehensive verification mechanism of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC). The OPCW Fact-Finding Mission subsequently confirmed the use of chemical weapons at other sites in Syria. The Joint Investigative Mechanism established by the UNSC in August 2015, and later the Investigation and Identification Team created by the OPCW Conference of the States Parties in June 2018, identified the Syrian government as being responsible for employing chemical weapons on several occasions. Although the States Parties suspended Syria’s voting and other rights in the OPCW in 2021, further action by the UNSC is unlikely because of Russian opposition. In fact, Russia has fully supported the Syrian government in international forums following its military intervention in the country’s civil war in September 2015. At the OPCW, Russia, together with a few other countries, launched a concerted campaign to discredit the findings of different investigations. They fabricated several, sometimes contradictory, narratives in order to sow confusion and doubt in the minds of third parties about the Syrian government’s responsibility for chemical-weapon attacks. And they persistently tried to discredit the science-based reports that were sufficient to establish the facts. According to some Russian accounts, armed opposition groups in Syria used chemical weapons in such a way as to make Syria’s Russia-backed government appear responsible. The Syrian government argued that it did not need to use chemical weapons, because it had sufficient conventional capabilities to quell armed opposition groups. Military experts thought otherwise. In some areas where the Syrian army got bogged down, the use of chemical weapons apparently helped to create panic and terror among civilians, demoralize opposition forces, and capture territories controlled by them with fewer losses for the army. Moreover, the recent use of chemical weapons has not been limited to Syria. The nerve agent Novichok was used to poison the former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, in 2018 in the United Kingdom, and Kremlin opponent Alexei Navalny in 2020 in Russia. In 2017, the half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un was killed with VX – another nerve agent – at Kuala Lumpur airport. Russia, which inherited the world’s largest stockpile of chemical weapons from the Soviet Union, is now not supposed to have any. Along with other states, Russia was obliged to declare all chemical weapons in its possession to the OPCW and destroy them, subject to the organization’s verification, which occurred in November 2017. But the subsequent uses of Novichok (albeit in very small quantities) attributed to Russia have fueled suspicions that it may have hidden some of its stockpile. If so, would Russia use chemical weapons in Ukraine, especially if the war drags on? Or should we rule out this possibility, particularly in view of the significant deterrent provided by the OPCW’s reinforced attribution mechanism? To be sure, the verification procedures for investigating alleged chemical-weapons use have become more capable, sophisticated, and effective. CWC States Parties are determined to prevent any further uses, and since June 2018 the attribution mechanism can be invoked if there are new allegations of chemical-weapons use in any State Party. In my statement as OPCW director-general at the opening session of that 2018 meeting, I said that, “Chemical weapons use, wherever it occurs, is a serious offense requiring resolute action.” Moreover, I added, “If accountability is avoided, the potential re-emergence and acceptance of chemicals as weapons of war and terror will not be deterred.” I stand by that statement today. All states have a collective responsibility to prevent the use of chemical weapons by anyone, in any circumstances, including in Ukraine. But if we fail to do so, I am confident that those responsible will be identified and held accountable.",
            "乌克兰会否使用化学武器？ 伦敦 — — 俄罗斯在没有证据的情况下声称美国正在乌克兰运营生物战实验室。 而美国以“荒谬”为由驳斥了上述指控，并与北约领导人共同警告，克里姆林宫可能正在寻求制造借口，在其对邻国发起的猛烈军事攻击中使用化学和生物武器。 乌克兰此前曾表示，像其他许多国家一样，该国设立了致力于研究如何减轻危险疾病对人类和动物威胁的公共卫生实验室。 3月11日，联合国安理会应俄罗斯要求开会解决这一问题，但俄罗斯又一次无法提供证明其指控的任何可靠证据。 联合国秘书处向安理会成员国介绍了1975年签署的禁止生物武器公约，并提到了在对公约遵守情况有疑问时启动协商机制的可能性。 鉴于目前这种情况，俄罗斯和乌克兰之间进行此类磋商显然不太可能。 世界卫生组织显然更相信乌克兰方面的说法，并已建议该国销毁其公共卫生实验室中高度危险的病原体，以避免出现其在战斗中被意外泄露的结局。 但化学武器又是怎样的情况？ 在评估乌克兰使用化武风险时，我们应当回顾近期发生的主要事件，尤其是在叙利亚，在该国内战期间曾多次使用化学武器。 2013年9月，由时任联合国秘书长潘基文依据1925年日内瓦公约所含禁令触发的联合国秘书长机制确定，此前一个月曾经在位于大马士革郊区的古塔使用过沙林神经毒剂。 那次袭击造成1，400多名平民死亡的结局。 在俄美两国达成协议后，叙利亚同意放弃化学武器并于2013年10月加入禁止化学武器组织（OPCW ） 。 这意味着叙利亚进入到禁止化学武器公约（CWC）的全面核查机制。 禁化武组织的实况调查团随后证实，在叙利亚的其他地点使用过化学武器。 由联合国安理会于2015年8月成立的联合调查机制，以及后来于2018年6月由禁化武组织缔约国会议成立的调查和鉴定小组，不止一次地认定叙利亚政府对使用化学武器负有责任。 尽管缔约国于2021年终止了叙利亚在禁化武组织中的投票权和其他权利，但联合国安理会不大可能采取进一步行动，因为俄罗斯反对。 事实上，在2015年9月对该国内战进行军事干预后，俄罗斯一直在国际论坛中对叙利亚政府给予全力支持。 在禁化武组织中，俄罗斯与其他某些国家共同发起了一场协调运动，以对历次的调查结果进行诋毁。 他们编造了若干有时相互矛盾的叙述，其目的是在第三方的头脑中就叙利亚政府对化学武器袭击的责任播下困惑和怀疑。 而且，他们一直试图诋毁以科学为基础的报告，这些报告足以证明事实。 按照某些俄罗斯的说法，叙利亚反对派武装以一种令由俄罗斯所支持的叙利亚政府显得有责任的方式来使用化学武器。 叙利亚政府辩称它不需要使用化学武器，因为其具备足够的常规能力来镇压武装反对派团体。 但军事专家对此持不同看法。 在叙利亚军队陷入困境的一些地区，化学武器的使用显然有助于在平民当中制造慌乱和恐怖，打击反对派力量，并在军队损失较小的情况下占领他们所控制的地区。 此外，近期化学武器的使用并不仅仅限于叙利亚境内。 2018年，在英国，神经毒剂诺维乔克曾被用来毒杀前俄罗斯双面间谍斯克里帕尔和尤莉亚，斯克里帕尔的女儿。 诺维乔克还曾于2020年在俄罗斯被用来毒害克里姆林宫的对手阿列克谢·纳瓦尔尼。 2017年，朝鲜领导人金正恩的同父异母兄弟在吉隆坡机场被另外一种神经毒剂VX杀死。 俄罗斯从苏联继承了全世界规模最大的化学武器库，现在原本应该已经没有任何库存。 俄罗斯有义务同其他国家一道向禁化武组织申报其所拥有的化学武器并予以销毁，相关销毁需要经过禁化武组织的核查，上述核查过程发生在2017年的11月。 但随后使用归属于俄罗斯的诺维乔克（尽管剂量很小）已经引发了人们对其可能隐藏了部分库存的怀疑。 如果情况果真如此，尤其是在战争长期持续的情况下，俄罗斯是否会在乌克兰使用化学武器？ 亦或我们应该排除这种可能性，尤其考虑到禁化武组织强化归因机制所提供的巨大威慑力？ 可以肯定，调查涉嫌化武使用的核查程序已经变得更强大、更精密和更有效。 化学武器公约缔约国决心阻止化学武器的任何进一步使用，而自2018年6月起，如果有任何缔约国使用化学武器的新指控，即可援引该归因机制。 在我身为禁化武组织总干事于2018年会议开幕式上所做的发言中，我曾经表示 ， “ 无论在何处使用化学武器，都是一项严重罪行，需要采取坚决行动 。 ” 此外，我还补充道 ， “ 如果规避问责，那么化学物质作为战争和恐怖武器潜在的重新出现和被使用将无法被阻止 。 ” 我今天还坚持这种观点。 所有国家均有集体责任防止任何人在任何情况下使用化学武器，包括在乌克兰。 但如果我们未能实现目标，我相信，我们将找出责任者，并追究他们的责任。"

            "Will China “Lose” the 2008 Olympics? When the International Olympic Committee awarded Beijing the 2008 Summer Games in July 2001, the announcement ignited wild celebrations across the country. The Chinese Communist Party hoped to use the Games to showcase the country’s emergence as a dynamic, modern nation. But as China’s leaders begin final preparations for the Games next August, they may be wondering if hosting the event was such a good idea after all. They have significant reasons for doubt. China’s senior leaders always closely monitor spontaneous public expressions of nationalist fervor, fearful that shifting winds might blow an unwelcome storm in their direction. Of course what they hope is that the Games will channel these energies toward national solidarity, which will allow the leadership to deliver its people a moment of achievement and patriotic glory. But the Olympics will also bring intense international scrutiny of China’s weaknesses at a delicate moment in the country’s development. The world already knows of China’s success and its attractiveness as a destination for foreign investment, but few outsiders have seen firsthand the steep price the country is paying for its new prosperity. The most obvious signs of that cost flow through the country’s waterways and contaminate its air. Runaway growth and development have left about 70% of China’s lakes and rivers severely polluted, many unfit for human use of any kind. Indeed, nearly a half-billion Chinese lack access to clean drinking water, and the number of terminally polluted rivers and lakes grows daily. But air quality will prove the more embarrassing problem next August. Television coverage of athletes gasping for breath will hardly provide Beijing with the signature Olympic image it had in mind, and growing international anxiety over climate change and other environmental hazards will ensure that such issues receive considerable media coverage. There is also the risk that the Games will become a political circus, as the international spotlight generates irresistible opportunities for public protest. The Chinese leadership has demonstrated many times that it can quell domestic dissent, but the unique scale of the Olympics will require round-the-clock vigilance. Activists with grievances over Tibet, Taiwan, Burma, Darfur, and dozens of other political, environmental, and human-rights issues are already making plans. Is China ready for Greenpeace, Human Rights in China, Amnesty International, and Falun Gong supporters to take to the streets, with thousands of foreign journalists hungry for stories and asking questions that the authorities are unaccustomed to answering? Even if police are able to maintain order in Beijing, can they extend that control across the country? Can they manage the flow of information and ideas through the blogosphere as online activists open yet another front in their battle for free information? What we do know that Chinese officials have never faced a challenge of this scale with such a potential to both win and lose face. The Games will generate significant foreign-policy risks as well. In Taiwan, outgoing President Chen Shui-bian is stirring the independence pot, knowing that the Olympic spotlight will limit Beijing’s ability to respond forcefully. He has already proposed a popular referendum on Taiwanese membership in the United Nations. China’s influence within the UN would prevent such a move even if Taiwan voted yes, but an international confrontation is the last thing China wants coinciding with the Olympics. Then there is the matter of how the Games will be received in the West. Since 2001, China has increasingly become the focal point of much anxiety in the developed world. Huge bilateral trade deficits, accusations that China keeps its currency undervalued, and a rash of defective and dangerous Chinese-made exports have fueled a protectionist backlash in the United States and Europe. Amid bitter election-year debates over Iraq and Iran, and a souring economic outlook, Americans may be in no mood for the triumphalist pageantry of a new rising power on display in Beijing. Will China’s uneasy Asian neighbors be any more receptive? International criticism is sure to follow if something, anything, goes wrong during the Games, especially if it involves the suppression of dissent and is vectored around the world via 24-hour cable television and the Internet. China has changed since it “won” the 2008 games seven years ago. The Party leadership has grown more self-assured in its growing international role, but its ability to manage the pace of change at home has become more uncertain. In 2001, then President Jiang Zemin hoped the Games would herald China’s arrival as an industrialized power. But his successor, Hu Jintao, has focused on the damage that has come from unrestrained growth. He and Premier Wen Jiabao have also championed a more “harmonious” society, because they understand that the growing wealth gap, social tensions, environmental and public health problems, and the Party’s tenuous relationship with China’s less advantaged people can no longer be neglected. As China’s leaders scramble to address these challenges, will they still relish the idea of providing an international audience with front-row seats? How they look back on the Games once the confetti is swept from the streets is far from certain.",
            "中国将“失去”2008年奥运会吗？ 当国际奥委会在2001年7月将2008年夏季奥运会的主办权授予北京时，整个国家都陷入欢腾之中。 中国共产党希望用这次奥运会来展示这个国家已经成长为一个充满活力、现代化的国家。 但是当中国的领导人正在为明年八月举办的奥运会作最后的准备时，他们也许正怀疑举办这样一次运动会到底是不是一个那么美妙的主意。 他们很有理由要对此表示怀疑。 中国的高层领导人总是密切地监视公众自发表现出的民族主义狂热，担心转动的风向也许会发起针对他们的不受欢迎的风暴。 他们希望的当然是奥运会能把这些能量引向民族的团结，从而使领导层能够给它的人民带去一个充满成就和爱国主义荣耀的时刻。 但是奥运会也会带来国际社会对正处于国家发展微妙阶段的中国的弱点的密切观察。 世界已经了解到了中国的成功以及它对外商投资的吸引力，但是很少有外人能够亲眼看到这个国家为它新的繁荣所付出的高昂代价。 最明显的迹象是流动在这个国家的河道和弥漫在空气中的代价。 快速的经济增长使中国大约70%的河流遭到了严重的污染，许多已经不适合人类进行任何形式的使用了。 事实上，几乎有近五亿中国人无法获得干净的饮用水，而遭到严重污染的江河湖泊的数量每天都在增加。 但是空气质量将会在明年八月被证明是一个更令人尴尬的难题。 运动员呼吸苦难的电视画面很难让北京获得它心目中想留给人们的奥运会形象，而国际社会对气候变化及其他环境灾害的日益关注肯定会使媒体大量地关注这些问题。 同时奥运会还存在成为一场政治马戏的危险，因为国际社会对奥运会的关注给公众抗议活动带来了令人难以拒绝的机会。 中国的领导层已经多次展示了它压制国内不满声音的能力，但是像奥运会这样大规模的盛会需要一天二十四小时不停地保持警戒。 对西藏、台湾、缅甸、达尔富尔和许多其他政治、环境和人权问题感到不满的激进分子已经在进行筹划了。 中国已经准备好如何应对绿色和平组织、人权在中国、国际特赦组织和法轮功的支持者走上街头，还有数千名渴望寻找故事素材并且会问一些当局不习惯回答的问题的外国记者了吗？ 即便警察能够维持北京的秩序，但是他们能够控制整个国家吗？ 他们能够限制通过网志空间传播的信息和思想吗？ 因为网上的激进分子已经开辟了他们为信息自由而战的另一条战线。 我们所知道的是中国的官员而从来没有这样大规模的可能使他们在赢得脸面的同时也失去脸面的挑战。 奥运会同时也会带来严重的外交政策风险。 台湾即将离任的总统陈水扁正在掀起独立运动，因为他知道对奥运会的关注会限制北京做出强硬反应的能力。 他已经提出要在台湾加入联合国的问题进行全民公投。 即便台湾人表决同意加入联合国，中国在联合国内的影响力也会阻止这样的行动，但是国际对抗是中国在奥运会举办期间最不想发生的事情。 另外还有西方国家如何接受奥运会的问题。 自从2001年以来，中国越来越成为发达国家严重忧虑的焦点。 巨额的双边贸易赤字、对中国让货币保持在低水平的谴责、中国出口的产品一再发生质量低劣以及危险性的问题遭到了美国和欧洲的保护主义者的强烈抗议。 在选举年对伊拉克和伊朗问题进行的激烈辩论中，以及经济前景的暗淡使美国人也许没有心思关注在北京上演的一个新崛起的大国胜利主义者的盛大场面。 中国那些感到不安的亚洲邻国会更接受这场盛会吗？ 如果在奥运会期间有什么事或者任何事出了差错，国际的批评家可能会穷追不舍，尤其是如果它压制不满的声音并且通过有线电视和因特网将消息24小时不间断地传播到整个世界的话。 自从七年前“赢得”2008年奥运会的举办权以来中国已经发生了巨大的变化。 共产党的领导层因为它在国际社会越来越高的地位而变得更加自信，但是它是否能跟上国内所发生的变化的步伐也变得更加不确定了。 在2001年时，当时的国家主席江泽民希望奥运会能够展现中国已经成为一个工业化强国。 但是他的继任者胡锦涛则把注意力集中在无节制的发展所造成的危害上。 胡锦涛和总理温家宝还提倡更加“和谐”的社会，因为他们认识到越拉越大的贫富差距、社会矛盾、环境和公共健康问题以及党与中国的劣势人群的紧张关系都是不能够再忽视的问题。 当中国的领导人艰难地应对这些挑战时，他们还有心思为国际社会的观众提供前排的座位吗？ 我们还不知道等到大街上的彩纸屑散去时他们会怎样回头看这届奥运会。"

            "Will China’s Capitalist Revolution Turn Democratic Communist China has experienced a monumental capitalist revolution in the last two decades, with an economy that is now six times bigger than it was 20 years ago. A minor player in the global economy in the 1980’s, China today is the world’s third largest trading power. But if these stunning economic statistics make you think that so much capitalist development must also have brought more democracy to China, think again. Most Westerners believe in a theory of liberal evolution, according to which sustained economic growth, by increasing wealth and the size of the middle class, gradually makes a country more democratic. While the long-run record of this theory is irrefutable, China’s authoritarian ruling elite is not only determined to hold on to power, but it also has been smart enough to take adaptive measures aimed at countering the liberalizing effects of economic development. Thus, for all its awe-inspiring economic achievement, China has made remarkably little progress in political liberalization. Indeed, judging by several key indicators, progress toward democracy in China has stalled, despite unprecedented economic prosperity and personal freedom. For instance, in the mid-1980’s, Chinese leaders seriously discussed and later drew up a blueprint for modest democratic reforms. Today, the topic of political reform is taboo. Nearly all the major institutional reforms, such as strengthening the legislature, holding village elections, and building a modern legal system, were launched in the 1980’s. Since the Tiananmen Square massacre of June 1989, however, not a single major democratic reform initiative has been implemented. Instead of democratic transition, China has witnessed a consolidation of authoritarian rule – the strengthening of a one-party regime through organizational learning and adaptation. Since 1989, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has been pursuing a two-pronged strategy: selective repression that targets organized political opposition and co-optation of new social elites (the intelligentsia, professionals, and private entrepreneurs). This strategy emphasizes the maintenance of an extensive law enforcement apparatus designed to eliminate any incipient organized opposition. Huge investments have strengthened the People’s Armed Police (PAP), a large anti-riot paramilitary force whose specialty is the quick suppression of anti-government protests by disgruntled industrial workers, peasants, and urban residents. Frequent deployment of the PAP is a major reason why the tens of thousands of collective protests that occur each year (74,000 in 2004 and 86,000 in 2005) have had a negligible impact on China’s overall stability. To deal with new emerging political threats, such as the information revolution, the Chinese government has spent mightily on manpower and technology. A special 30,000-strong police unit monitors and screens Internet traffic, advanced technology is deployed to block access to overseas Web sites considered “hostile or harmful,” and Internet service and content providers, both domestic and Western, must comply with onerous restrictions designed to suppress political dissent and track down offenders. The regime has even conducted multi-agency exercises to test whether different government bodies could cooperate closely to keep “harmful information” off the Net during an emergency. Having learned from the collapse of the Soviet Union that a bureaucratic ruling party must co-opt new social elites to deprive potential opposition groups of leaders, the Communist Party has conducted an effective campaign of expanding its social base. The urban intelligentsia and professionals have been pampered with material perks and political recognition, while new private entrepreneurs have been allowed to join the Party. This strategy of pre-emptive political decapitation has produced enormous dividends for the Party. In the 1980’s, its principal adversaries were the urban intelligentsia, who constituted the backbone of the pro-democracy movement that culminated in Tiananmen Square. Today, the mainstream of the Chinese intelligentsia is an integral part of the ruling elite. Many have joined the Party and become government officials, and a large percentage enjoy various professional and financial privileges. Predictably, the intelligentsia, usually the most liberal social group, is no longer a lethal threat to party rule. Worse, without support from this strategic group, other social groups, such as workers and peasants, have become politically marginalized and rudderless. Although the Party’s carrot-and-stick approach has worked since 1989, it is doubtful that it will retain its efficacy for another 17 years. To the extent that China’s authoritarian regime is by nature exclusionary (it can only incorporate a limited number of elites), the co-optation strategy will soon run up against its limits, and the Party will no longer have the resources to buy off the intelligentsia or keep private entrepreneurs happy. At the same time, selective repression can contain social frustrations and discontent only temporarily. As long as much of Chinese society views the current political system as unjust, unresponsive, and corrupt, there will always be a large reservoir of ill will toward the ruling elites. When things go wrong – as is likely, given mounting social strains caused by rising inequality, environmental degradation, and deteriorating public services – China’s alienated masses could become politically radicalized. And, unlike past protests, which have usually been allied with students or members of the intelligentsia, popular disaffection might not have the virtue of rational leaders with whom the government could talk and negotiate. So it may be premature for the Party to celebrate the success of its adaptive strategy. China’s rulers may have stalled democratic trends for now, but the current strategy has, perhaps, merely delayed the inevitable.",
            "中国的资本主义革命能否转变为民主化 过去二十年中，共产中国经历了资本主义革命巨变，其现今的经济总量是二十年前的6倍。 二十世纪八十年代中国在全球经济中还微不足道，如今，它已经是世界第三大贸易大国。 但是，如果这些耀人的经济数据让你以为如此多的资本主义发展必定给中国带来了更多的民主，那你就需要三思了。 大多数西方人相信自由演变的理论。 根据这一理论，持续的经济增长提高财富、扩大中产阶级的规模，将逐步让国家变得更为民主。 尽管这一理论的长期性纪录毋庸置疑，但是，中国专制主义统治精英不仅决心保持权力，而且，它已经聪明之极，采取适应性措施，目的在于打击经济发展的自由化效果。 因此，尽管取得了令人仰慕的经济发展成就，中国在政治自由化方面依然裹足不前。 实际上，根据几项关键性指标来评估，尽管中国取得了前所未有的经济繁荣和个人自由，其朝向民主的进步已经停滞。 例如，八十年代中期，中国领导人认真地讨论并后来制定了温和的民主改革的蓝图。 今天，政治改革的话题是禁区。 几乎所有主要的机构性改革，例如加强人大、举行乡村选举以及建立现代司法制度等都是在八十年代发起的。 但是，自从1989年6月天安门广场屠杀以来，没有任何一个主要的民主改革项目得到了实行。 中国不仅没有实行民主转型，其专制统治，也就是通过组织上的学习和改造强化一党统治反而得到了加强。 1989年以来，中国共产党一直实行两手策略，即针对有组织的政治反对派进行有选择的镇压以及拉拢收买社会精英（知识分子、专业人员以及私营企业家 ） 。 这一策略强调维持庞大的执法力量，目的在于消灭任何早期的有组织反对势力。 武警是一支庞大的半军事化防暴力量，专门用来迅速镇压怨声载道的产业工人、农民和城市居民的反政府抗议。 中共投入巨资加强其力量。 时常调集武警，因此，每年数以万计的集体抗议事件（2004年7万4千起，2005年8万6千起）对中国的整体稳定无关痛痒。 为了应付类似信息革命等新涌现的政治威胁，中国政府花费巨资增强人员和技术。 3万多人组成的特别网警监视和过滤互联网内容，采用先进技术阻挡被认为是“敌对和有害”的海外网站。 国内和西方的互联网服务和内容供应商必须遵守严格的限制措施，目的在于压制政治异议以及追踪违反者。 中共甚至举行了多部门的演习来测试不同的政府部门是否能够紧密合作，在紧急情况下将“有害信息”拒之于网门之外。 中共从苏联解体中得到教训，那就是官僚的执政党必须拉拢新的社会精英来剥夺潜在反对团伙的领导人，因此，它有效地扩大了其社会基础。 城市知识分子和专业人员大举获得物质实惠和政治承认，而新兴的私营企业家则被允许入党。 中共从这种先发制人的政治斩首战略中获益不少。 八十年代，中共的主要对手是城市知识分子，他们构成了要求民主运动的骨干力量，这场运动最终导致天安门事件。 今天，中国知识分子的主流是统治精英不可或缺的一部分。 许多人已经入党当官，还有很大一部分人则享受专业和财政上的特权。 不难想见，知识分子尽管通常是最为自由化的社会团体，但是他们已经不再是中共统治的致命威胁了。 更糟的是，没有这一战略性团体的支持，其他社会团体，例如工人和农民已经在政治上被边缘化了，而且群龙无首。 尽管中共的胡萝卜加大棒的政策自1989年以来一直奏效，它能够在下一个17年里维持其效力还很难说。 只要中国的专制统治政权在本质上排除异己（它只能吸纳数量有限的精英 ） ， 拉拢收买策略不久就会黔驴技穷，而中共也就不会再有资源来收买知识分子或者让私营企业家心满意足。 与此同时，有选择性的打压只能暂时控制社会失望和不满。 只要中国社会的大部分都认为当前的政治体制不公正、麻木不仁以及腐败，那么，就会有大量的朝向统治精英的恶意。 鉴于不平等加剧、环境破坏以及日益崩溃的公共服务引发不断上涨的社会压力，形势有可能恶化。 持敌对意见的中国大众有可能在政治上极端化。 以往的抗议大多与学生或知识分子结盟，与此不同的是，大众的不满不大可能具有理性的、政府可以对话和谈判的领导人了。 所以，中共现在庆贺其适应策略的胜利为时尚早。 中国的统治者现在可能拖延了民主趋势，但是，目前的策略可能只不过是推迟了不可避免的事情。"

            "Could China Turn Inward? SHANGHAI – On the face of it, China and the United States both look as though they would be relatively insulated if trade tensions continue to escalate. China’s exports to the US account for only 4% of its GDP, and its imports from the US amount to just 1% of GDP. In the US, with its large, domestically driven economy, the equivalent figures are 1% and 3%. But putting aside these headline numbers, a retreat from globalization by the world’s two largest economies would nonetheless entail significant costs. True, China has been rebalancing away from exports: domestic consumption contributed to more than 60% of its GDP growth in ten of the 15 quarters since 2015, and up to 80% in the first half of 2018. In many consumer categories, China is now the world’s largest market. In the first quarter of 2018, it overtook the US as the world’s top box office. And it also now accounts for 30% of global auto sales (and 43% of unit sales of electric vehicles) and 42% of global retail e-commerce transaction value. Moreover, the McKinsey Global Institute finds that while the world’s exposure to China in terms of trade, technology, and capital increased from 2000 to 2017, China’s exposure to the world peaked in 2007, and has declined ever since. As recently as 2008, China’s net trade surplus accounted for 8% of its GDP; by 2017, it had fallen to 1.7%. That is less than either Germany or South Korea, where net exports generate 5-8% of GDP. Following a sustained period in which China drove global growth, it seems as though its great “opening up” is losing momentum. After China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, it cut tariffs by half, bringing them down to 8% as of 2008. Yet, by 2016, they had edged back up to 9.6% – a rate that is more than double the US and EU average. At the same time, China’s barriers to foreign capital inflows to services remain high. And the government appears to promote the growth of local companies, not least through its “Made in China 2025” plan, which sets guidelines for domestic companies in 11 of 23 high-priority subsectors. Still, these trends do not necessarily mean that China is closing itself off from the world. In fact, there are five reasons why an increasingly autarchic China is unlikely. For starters, China remains dependent on foreign technology, with half of its technology imports coming from just three countries – the US (27%), Japan (17%), and Germany (11%) – between 2011 and 2016. More to the point, these numbers have barely budged over the past 20 years, despite China’s efforts to boost innovation at home. Second, were China to close itself off, it would damage its neighbors’ economic prospects, thus destabilizing its own immediate region. For example, according to a recent OECD analysis, Malaysia, Singapore, and South Korea could lose 0.5-1.5% of GDP each as a result of reduced US-China trade. This, in turn, would set back China’s ambitions to be the region’s trade anchor. Third, with a turn inward, China would start to miss out on investment and know-how from the multinationals currently operating in its economy. As of 2015, there were 481,000 foreign enterprises in China (more than twice as many as in 2000), employing around 14 million workers. About 40% of China’s exports are produced by foreign companies, or by foreign-domestic joint ventures. Moreover, foreign firms produce 87% of electronics in China, and 59% of machinery. Not by coincidence, those are the sectors most affected by the current trade dispute. A survey conducted by the American Chamber of Commerce in China reinforces concerns about the impact of escalating trade tensions on foreign investment. Already, 31% of US firms say they may delay or cancel investment decisions, 18% may relocate some or all of their manufacturing outside China, and 3% may even exit the Chinese market altogether. Fourth, a reduction in trade could sap the reform momentum China needs to iron out the many inefficiencies in its domestic economy. For example, China’s efforts to position its financial system to manage the risks associated with high debt levels will be sidelined if it is forced to provide more liquidity to the economy to make up for trade losses. Likewise, China’s inefficient state-owned enterprises – whose return on assets is only 30-50% that of private-sector companies – need to be overhauled as part of a broader agenda to boost productivity. But if the economy comes under pressure, those efforts, too, could be delayed for fear of undermining employment. Finally, and more broadly, there is ample evidence showing that global interconnectedness is good for growth. MGI finds that global flows of goods, services, capital, people, and data over the past decade have boosted world GDP by around 10% above where it otherwise would have been. A reversal of China’s great opening up would hurt not just China, but everyone – including the US. Losing access to Chinese markets, capital flows, exports, and talent would result in higher prices and slower growth, whereas the benefits of reduced levels of competition to US industries are less clear. Chinese imports have cut the price of US consumer goods by an estimated 27%. And firms in the US would take a direct hit from higher tariffs in trade, given that 77% of China’s exports to the US are intermediary and capital goods used to produce finished products, according to the McKinsey Global Trade Database. Turning inward may be tempting for China, but the economic costs of doing so would be significant. One hopes – perhaps against hope – that the 90-day truce on tariff increases lasts, so that an enduring trade agreement can be forged.",
            "中国会向内转吗？ 上海—表面看来，如果贸易紧张继续升级，中国和美国都将相对绝缘。 中国对美出口只占其GDP的4 % ， 从美进口只占GDP的1 % 。 在美国，庞大的经济主要由内需拉动，相应的数字分别为1%和3 % 。 但抛却这些标题数字不谈，世界最大的两个经济体从全球化中撤退仍然会造成沉重的代价。 诚然，中国一直在摆脱出口依赖，实现再平衡：2015年以来的15个季度中，有是个季度国内消费贡献了GDP增长的60%强，2018年上半年更是达到了80 % 。 在许多消费门类中，中国都已经是世界最大市场。 2018年一季度，中国取代美国成为世界票房冠军。 目前中国还贡献了30%全球汽车销量（以及43%的电动汽车单位销量）和42%的全球零售电子商务交易量。 此外，麦肯锡全球研究所发现，2000年至2017年间，世界对中国贸易、技术和资本的敞口（exposure）不断增加，而中国对世界的敞口在2007年达到顶峰，此后开始下降。 在2008年，中国净贸易盈余占GDP的8 % ； 到2017年，该比例下降至1.7 % 。 这一数字比德国和韩国都要低，后两者的净出口贡献了GDP的5—8 % 。 在经历了一段中国不断对同全球增长的时期后，中国的伟大“开放”似乎正在失去动力。 2001年加入世界贸易组织后，中国将关税下调了一半，到2008年关税税率为8 % 。 但到2016年，关税又回升至9.6 % — —比美国和欧盟平均水平高一倍。 与此同时，中国对外国资本流入服务业的壁垒仍然非常高。 政府似乎要推动本地公司的成长，包括通过其“中国制造2025”计划为23个重点次级行业中的11个制定了国内企业指引。 尽管如此，这些趋势未必意味着中国正在向世界关闭大门。 事实上，出于五个原因，中国不可能变得越来越专制。 首先，中国仍然依赖外国技术，2011至2016年间，其技术进口中的一半来自三个国家 — — 美国（27 % ） 、日本（17 % ） 和德国（11 % ） 。 更重要的是，这些数字在过去20年来基本保持稳定，尽管中国非常努力地提高国内创新。 其次，如果中国实行闭关锁国，将危及邻国的经济前景，从而动摇周边。 比如，据经合组织的最新分析 ，马来西亚、新加坡和韩国将因为中美贸易的萎缩而损失0.5—1.5%的GDP。 这反过来不利于中国成为地区贸易锚的雄心。 第三，向内转的中国将失去目前在中国开展业务的跨国企业的投资和知识。 2015年，有481,000家外国企业在华经营（数量是2000年的两倍多 ） ， 雇用了大约1,400万人。 约40%的中国出口由外国公司或中外合资企业生产。 此外，外国企业生产了中国87%的电子产品和59%的机械 。 同时，这些行业也是受当前贸易纠纷影响最大的行业。 美国中国商会的调查特别关注贸易紧张升级对外国投资的影响。 目前，有31%的美国企业说它们可能推迟或取消投资决定，18%可能将部分或全部制造业务搬离中国，3%甚至将彻底退出中国市场。 第四，么偶一的萎缩可能影响到中国克服国内经济低效率所需要的改革动力。 比如，如果中国被迫向经济注入更多流动性以抵消贸易损失，就会丧失通过金融体系管理高债务相关风险的立场。 类似地，中国的效率低下的国有企业 — — 它们的资产回报率只有民营企业的30—50 % — —需要进行改革，这也是提高生产率的总体计划的一部分。 但如果经济承受压力，这些措施也可能因为影响就业而推迟。 最后，更广泛地说，大量证据表明全球联动性对增长有利。 麦肯锡全球研究所发现，过去十年来商品、服务、资本、人员和数据的全球流动让全球GDP提高了大约10 % 。 中国伟大开放的逆转所伤及的不仅是中国，而是所有人 — — 包括美国。 失去了中国市场、资本流、出口和人才，将导致更高的价格和更慢的增长，而美国产业未必能够因为竞争水平降低而获益。 中国进口品将美国消费商品价格拉低了大约27 % 。 而如果贸易关税提高的话，在美企业将受到直接冲击，因为据麦肯锡全球贸易数据库，77%的中国对美出口是用于生产最终产品的中间产品和资本商品。 向内转可能对中国来说很有吸引力，但这样做的经济代价将是巨大的。 但愿为期90天的提高关税政策休战能够持续下去，从而形成持久的贸易协定。"

            "Another Long, Hot Summer in America NEW YORK – Could the United States be facing a reprise of the summer of 1968? Then, too, the world saw images of popular rage boiling over in America, as mostly African-American inner cities went up in flames, and young people were tear-gassed, charged at, and often brutally beaten by riot police and National Guardsmen. The result of the civil disorder was what some liberals in America fear will happen later this year. The Republican presidential candidate Richard Nixon promised the “silent majority,” the “non-shouters,” and the “non-demonstrators,” that he would restore law and order with force. Devastated, mostly African-American urban areas were starved of federal funds and further isolated, white suburbanites bought more guns, and police forces were armed as though they were a branch of the military. The trouble in 1968, like the protests today, also started with anger against the oppression of black people in America. A day after Martin Luther King, Jr., declared that “the nation is sick,” he was shot dead by a white racist criminal. The protests that followed were not just an expression of anger at King’s murder, but also the lack of economic and educational opportunities that were the result of a long and often violent racist history. Despite an African-American’s two terms in the White House, conditions today are hardly better – and in some ways worse. King’s violent death was echoed this year by that of George Floyd, the defenseless 46-year-old black man in Minneapolis killed by a policeman who kneeled on his neck for almost nine minutes. Moreover, COVID-19 has hit African-Americans with particular fury, because many lack financial savings and are forced to work in risky areas, as nurses and other “essential workers,” often without proper health care. Once the global depression sinks in, many won’t be cushioned by anything at all. And yet, there are important differences between now and the summer of 1968, apart from the fact that the music was more interesting then, and there were more sexual opportunities. The last point is not entirely frivolous. Being effectively locked up in relative isolation for several months will only have added to the frustrations of many young people, who are only too glad to vent them in the streets. The protests in 1968 were not just about racial inequality, but also about the Vietnam War. The two issues were related. President Lyndon B. Johnson, responsible for escalating that reckless and savage war, was a Democrat, the same man who passed civil rights bills that had actually improved African-Americans’ lives, and by doing so provoked the hatred of many Southern voters, who switched their allegiance to the Republican Party, helping to push it further to the right. The “shouters” and “demonstrators” that Nixon railed against were not just black people, but also young whites who resisted being forced to fight in a war they considered immoral. Robert F. Kennedy, the candidate who promised to end the war and who visited the burning ghettos to calm African-Americans’ fears, was assassinated two months after King. Nixon won the election that November not only because he soothed the panicked “silent majority” with promises of law and order, but also because Hubert Humphrey, a decent mainstream Democrat, refused to condemn the Vietnam War. Joe Biden, this year’s presumptive Democratic candidate, has shown that for all his flaws, he may not be another Hubert Humphrey. His sympathies are clearly with the demonstrators. Biden has publicly recalled many instances of police violence against unarmed black people and promised to reform law enforcement. In bad times, the challenger has a certain advantage. Just as Johnson was held accountable for escalating an increasingly unpopular war, the current occupant of the White House will have to own the sickness of America today. Donald Trump cannot be blamed for the COVID-19 pandemic, but he can be held accountable for botching the response. Likewise, the institutional racism that once again is setting America’s streets on fire did not begin with Trump. But he has deliberately fanned the flames by insulting dark-skinned immigrants as criminals and calling armed white supremacists decent, by dismissing angry black protesters as “thugs,” and encouraging militiamen, guardsmen, and policemen to do their worst, or as he put it with a snarl: “Please don’t be too nice.” While some groups on the far right in the US talk, hopefully, of a coming “race war,” Trump does nothing to dampen their violent enthusiasm. On the contrary, he seems to revel in it. Trump’s recent tweet that “when the looting starts, the shooting starts” is a direct quote from the police chief of Miami, Florida, who ordered his troopers in 1967 to aim their shotguns at demonstrators from the “negro areas” in his city. This is called “stirring up the base.” And much of Trump’s base surely will be stirred up. The big question in November will be what people who voted for him in 2016, but are not as fanatical in their support, will do. What are white suburban women, midwestern blue-collar workers, and elderly southerners (who are among most vulnerable to COVID-19 infection) thinking now? Many Americans are clearly horrified by their president’s crass and incendiary words. But will their disapproval be offset by anxiety about violent social unrest? Will age-old racial prejudices, often unspoken, or even acknowledged, still make them vote for the false security of a coarse white bully? Much will depend on how hot this summer gets. If people think rationally in November, it is hard to imagine that enough of them would vote to keep this appalling administration in power for another four years. But fear is reason’s worst enemy.",
            "美国又一个漫长而炎热的夏天 纽约—美国是否正在面对着1968年夏天的重现？ 当时，世界同样目睹了美国人燃烧的愤怒，因为绝大多数非洲裔美国人聚居的内城都在熊熊燃烧，而年轻人则被催泪瓦斯袭击、被指控，而且往往遭到防暴警察和国民警卫队的残酷殴打。 某些自由主义的美国人担忧，今年晚些时候会出现同样的内乱结果。 时任共和党总统候选人理查德·尼克松承诺那些“沉默的大多数 、 ” “没有参与喊叫和示威者 ” ， 他将用武力恢复法律和秩序。 被彻底摧毁的绝大多数非洲裔美国人聚居的城市地区在完全被切断了联邦资金流的同时遭到进一步隔离，而白人郊区民众则购买了更多的枪支，而警察则武装起来，就好像他们是军队的一个分支。 1968年的麻烦像今天的抗议活动一样，同样源于压迫美国黑人所引发的愤怒。 就在马丁·路德·金宣布“这个国家病了 ， ” 短短一天后，他就遭到一名白人种族主义罪犯的枪杀。 随之而来的抗议活动不仅表达了对金遭到谋杀的愤怒，而且同样是长期、暴力种族主义历史所导致的经济和教育机会匮乏的结果。 尽管非洲裔美国人已经入主白宫担任过两届总统，对如今的情况难言好转 — — 甚至在某些方面更糟。 金因暴力惨死与今年乔治·弗洛伊德的死亡相呼应，弗洛伊德是明尼苏达州一位手无寸铁的46岁黑人，由于一名警察跪在他的颈部长达近9分钟而丧生。 此外，2019年新冠病毒特别激怒了非洲裔美国人，因为不少人缺乏经济储蓄，被迫在危险地区从事护士和其他“基础性劳动”工作，而且往往没有合理的医疗保障。 一旦全球经济陷入萧条，许多人将根本得不到任何保护。 但今天和1968年夏天也存在重要的区别，这不包括那时的音乐更加有趣，而且性机会也更多。 最后一点并不完全出于轻浮。 被实际隔离在相对封闭环境中长达几个月只会加剧许多年轻人的沮丧感，他们迫不及待地想要在街头发泄。 1968年的抗议活动不仅涉及种族不平等，而且还涉及越南战争。 这两个问题具有相关性。 要为升级那场鲁莽和野蛮战争负责的林登·约翰逊总统是位民主党人，同样是他通过了实际改善非洲裔美国人生活的民权法案，而且他这样做激怒了许多南方选民，这些选民转而效忠共和党，从而在将共和党进一步推向右翼的过程中实际发挥了作用。 尼克松抨击的“呐喊”和“示威者”不仅仅是黑人，还包括许多年轻白人拒绝被迫参与一场他们认为不道德的战争。 罗伯特·肯尼迪作为候选人曾承诺结束战争，并到访燃烧的贫民窟以平息非洲裔美国人的恐惧，但却在金被害两个月后也遇刺丧生。 尼克松在当年11月的选举中获胜，这不仅因为他所承诺的法律和秩序安抚了惊慌失措的“沉默的大多数 ， ” 而且因为体面的主流民主党人休伯特·汉弗莱拒绝谴责越南战争。 今年的民主党候选人乔·拜登表明尽管他有种种缺陷，他可能不会再成为休伯特·汉弗莱的化身。 他显然同情示威者。 拜登已经公开历数了许多针对手无寸铁黑人的警方暴力事件，并承诺改革执法系统。 在困难时期，挑战者往往具有一定的优势。 就像约翰逊会被要求为一场不受欢迎但却不断升级的战争负责一样，现任白宫入主者将不得不承担今天美国问题的责任。 2019年新冠疫情不应全部归咎于唐纳德·特朗普，但他却要为自己拙劣的应对而承担责任。 同样，特朗普并非再次导致美国街道点燃熊熊大火的制度种族主义的始作俑者。 但他却故意煽风点火，侮辱肤色较深的移民为罪犯，并赞许白人至上的武装分子为正派人，他还对愤怒的黑人抗议者嗤之以鼻，并把他们称为“暴徒 ， ” 他还鼓励民兵、警卫和警察放纵作恶，或者就像他所咆哮的那样 ： “ 请不要太过友善 。 ” 尽管美国某些极右翼团体满怀期待地谈论即将爆发的“种族战争 ， ” 但特朗普在削弱其暴力热情方面却什么都没有做。 恰恰相反，他似乎非常享受这一过程。 特朗普的最新推文 ， “ 抢劫开始之时，就是射击开始之时”是直接引用佛罗里达州迈阿密警察局长的原话，此人曾在1967年命令他的部下将散弹枪瞄准该市“黑人区”的示威群众。 这就叫做“诲淫诲盗 。 ” 这对绝大多数特朗普的基本盘肯定会起到作用。 11月的真正问题是，那些2016年曾经投票给他，但却并不那么狂热支持他的人会怎么做。 现在郊区白人妇女、中西部蓝领工人和南方老年人（他们在2019年新冠疫情爆发期间几乎沦为最弱势群体）正在想什么？ 总统粗俗而颇具煽动性的言论显然让许多美国人深感震惊。 但他们对现状的不满是否会被对暴力社会动荡的焦虑所抵消？ 以潜规则形势存在甚至被公开承认的古老的种族偏见是否仍然会让他们投票给一个粗暴的白人欺凌者所带来的虚假安全？ 这在很大程度上将取决于今年夏天局势的发展。 如果人们在11月能够理性思考，很难想象会有足够多的人投票，让这个令人震惊的政府继续执政4年。 但恐惧是理性最强大的敌人。"

            "The Mirage of the Financial Singularity NEW HAVEN – In their new book The Incredible Shrinking Alpha, Larry E. Swedroe and Andrew L. Berkin describe an investment environment populated by increasingly sophisticated analysts who rely on big data, powerful computers, and scholarly research. With all this competition, “the hurdles to achieving alpha [returns above a risk-adjusted benchmark – and thus a measure of success in picking individual investments] are getting higher and higher.” That conclusion raises a key question: Will alpha eventually go to zero for every imaginable investment strategy? More fundamentally, is the day approaching when, thanks to so many smart people and smarter computers, financial markets really do become perfect, and we can just sit back, relax, and assume that all assets are priced correctly? This imagined state of affairs might be called the financial singularity, analogous to the hypothetical future technological singularity, when computers replace human intelligence. The financial singularity implies that all investment decisions would be better left to a computer program, because the experts with their algorithms have figured out what drives market outcomes and reduced it to a seamless system. Many believe that we are almost there. Even legendary investors like Warren Buffett, it is argued, are not really outperforming the market. In a recent paper, “Buffett’s Alpha,” Andrea Frazzini and David Kabiller of AQR Capital Management and Lasse Pedersen of Copenhagen Business School, conclude that Buffett is not generating significantly positive alpha if one takes account of certain lesser-known risk factors that have weighed heavily in his portfolio. The implication is that Buffet’s genius could be replicated by a computer program that incorporates these factors. If that were true, investors would abandon, en masse, their efforts to ferret out mispricing in the market, because there wouldn’t be any. Market participants would rationally assume that every stock price is the true expected present value of future cash flows, with the appropriate rate of discount, and that those cash flows reflect fundamentals that everyone understands the same way. Investors’ decisions would diverge only because of differences in their personal situation. For example, an automotive engineer might not buy automotive stocks – and might even short them – as a way to hedge the risk to his or her own particular type of human capital. Indeed, according to a computer crunching big data, this would be an optimal decision. There is a long-recognized problem with such perfect markets: No one would want to expend any effort to figure out what oscillations in prices mean for the future. Thirty-five years ago, in their classic paper, “On the Impossibility of Informationally Efficient Markets,” Sanford Grossman and Joseph Stiglitz presented this problem as a paradox: Perfectly efficient markets require the effort of smart money to make them so; but if markets were perfect, smart money would give up trying. The Grossman-Stiglitz conundrum seems less compelling in the financial singularity if we can imagine that computers direct all the investment decisions. Although alpha may be vanishingly small, it still represents enough profit to keep the computers running. But the real problem with this vision of financial singularity is not the Grossman-Stiglitz conundrum; it is that real-world markets are nowhere close to it. Computer enthusiasts are excited by things like the blockchain used by Bitcoin (covered on an education website called Singularity University, in a section dramatically titled Exponential Finance). But the futurists’ financial world bears no resemblance to today’s financial world. After all, the financial singularity implies that all prices would be based on such things as optimally projected future corporate profits and the correlation of profits with expected technological innovations and long-term demographic changes. But the smart money hardly ever talks in such ethereal terms. In this context, it is difficult not to think of China’s recent stock-market plunge. News accounts depict hordes of emotional people trading on hunch and superstition. That looks a lot more like reality than all the talk of impending financial singularity. Markets seem to be driven by stories, as I emphasize in my book Irrational Exuberance. There are stories of great new eras and of looming depressions. No one knows if these stories are true, but they take on a life of their own. Sometimes they go viral. When one has a heart-to-heart talk with many seemingly rational people, they turn out to have crazy theories. These people influence markets, because all other investors must reckon with them; and their craziness is not going away anytime soon. Maybe Buffett’s past investing style can be captured in a trading algorithm today. But that does not necessarily detract from his genius. Indeed, the true source of his success may consist in his understanding of when to abandon one method and devise another. The idea of financial singularity may seem inspiring; but it is no less illusory than the rational Utopia that inspired generations of central planners. Human judgment, good and bad, will drive investment decisions and financial-market outcomes for the rest of our lives and beyond.",
            "金融奇点的幻象 发自纽黑文 — — 在拉里·E·斯威德罗和安德烈·L·博尔金发表的新书 ， 《 不可思议的高回报萎缩》中，他们描述了一个充斥着日渐老练的高精尖分析员依赖大数据，超级电脑和学术研究成果工作的投资环境。 在所有这些竞争态势之下 ， “ 实现高回报（也就是获取高于所承担风险基准的回报并以此制定一个挑选各单一投资方式的成功策略）的门槛将越来越高 ” 。 这一结论产生了一个关键问题：对于所有人类可以设想出的投资策略来说，高回报是否最终会归零？ 更根本的是，是否有一天，在所有这些聪明人和更聪明的电脑的作用下，金融市场会否最终达到了完美的平衡，而我们只需要坐在那里什么都不干，并假设所有资产都被合理的定价？ 这个想象中的状况或许可被称为金融奇点，也是一个与设想中的未来科技奇点相似的东西，也就是电脑会代替人类智能。 而金融奇点则意味着，所有的投资决策最好留给电脑程序去决定，因为那些算法研究专家们已经找出了驱动市场表现的背后动力，并将其精简成为了一个天衣无缝的系统 许多人相信我们离那天不远了。 甚至认为即便是像沃伦·巴菲特这样的传奇投资者其实也并没有表现得比市场更好。 在最近发表的一篇名为《巴菲特高回报》的文章中，AQR资本管理的安德烈·法兹尼和戴维·卡比勒，以及哥本哈根商学院的拉斯·佩德森总结认为，如果考虑到巴菲特投资组合中某些权重极大的但不太为人知的风险因素，他其实并未获取非常巨大的正回报，暗示巴菲特的天赋是可以被一个综合协调所有这些因素的电脑程序所替代的。 如果这是真的话，投资者们会立刻全体行动，放弃尝试纠正市场错误定价的努力，因为不会再存在任何错误定价了。 市场参与者们会理性的假设每一个股价都是未来现金流预期的真实当前体现，而且折价率也非常恰当，而所有人对那些现金流所反映的基本面的理解都是一致的。 投资者决策只是因为他们个人状况的不同而有所不同。 比如说一个汽车工程师可能不会购买汽车公司的股票甚至会故意做空其中某个股票，以便对冲他或者她自身特定种类的人力资本风险。 事实上，对于一个拼命处理大数据的电脑来说，这才是一个最优选项。 但这些完美市场也存在一个长期被认识到的问题：没人再会花费任何精力去找出价格的波动对未来意味着什么。 在经典论文《论信息有效市场的不可能性》中，森福德·格罗斯曼和约瑟夫·斯蒂格利茨将这一问题视作一个矛盾个体：完美有效的市场需要聪明的资金不断努力去达到完美，但一旦市场变成了完美，这些聪明的资金将不会再进行任何运作了。 但如果我们想象只有电脑来指导所有投资决策的话，格罗斯曼-斯蒂格利茨迷题什么似乎在金融奇点方面缺乏说服力。 虽然高回报或许会小得不能再小，但始终意味着足够的利益去让这些电脑继续运作。 但对于这一金融奇点未来图景的真正问题并不是格罗斯曼-斯蒂格利茨迷题，而是真实的市场跟这就跟这个完全不相似。 电脑爱好者们会为比特币所用的阻断链欢呼雀跃（由一个叫基点大学的教育网站中戏剧化地命名为指数金融的部分所描述 ) 。 但未来主义者的金融世界可能与目前的金融事件没有任何相似之处。 毕竟金融基点意味着所有的价格将会基于最优投射的未来企业盈利，以及这些盈利与预期的技术革新和长期人口结构变化的相关性。 但那些聪明资金却绝少谈及这些超现实的词汇。 在这一背景下很难不去联想起中国市场最近的股票大跌。 新闻里描述成群像游牧民族般狂热的人们凭着直觉和迷信进行交易。 而相比于所谓的金融奇点来说，这更像真实的市场。 正如在我的新书《非理性充沛》中写的那样，市场似乎是有故事驱动的，同时也存在着伟大新时代和衰退即将逼近的故事，也有一些基本面故事关于技术和资源枯竭的，还有关于政治和令人瞠目结舌的阴谋的故事。 没人知道这些故事是否是真的，但这些故事却有着自身的生命力。 有时这些故事像病毒一样传播。 当你和许多看上去似乎理性的人深入交谈的时候，他们都会满嘴疯狂理论。 这些人会影响市场，因为其他所有的投资者都必须参考他们的决策，而他们的疯狂也不会在短期内消失。 或许巴菲特过去的投资风格可以被当今一个交易算法所模仿。 但这不一定会有损于他的天才。 事实上，他成功的真正源泉或许是因为他能理解是什么时候应当放弃一个投资手法并选择另外一种。 金融奇点的理论似乎除非常振奋人心，但是这也并不比那些鼓舞了数代中央计划者的理性乌托帮一样虚幻。 人类的判断，无论是好还是坏，都将在我们的余生甚至更长时间推动投资决策和金融市场表现。"

            "Will COVID Accelerate Productivity Growth? MUNICH – Since the mid-2000s, productivity growth in advanced economies has been anemic. Average annual productivity growth in the United States from 2005 to 2016 was just 1.3%, less than half of the 2.8% annual growth rate recorded between 1995 and 2004. Across other OECD countries, annual productivity growth declined from 2.3% in the 1995-2004 period to 1.1% between 2005 and 2015. This sluggish growth appears paradoxical, given recent rapid advances in digital innovation and artificial intelligence. As Erik Brynjolfsson, Daniel Rock, and Chad Syverson have noted, “we see transformative new technologies everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” But might the COVID-19 pandemic help to resolve the paradox by accelerating firms’ adoption of robots and other labor-saving innovations, thereby boosting productivity growth? Recent research that I co-authored shows that the pandemic has prompted an increasing number of rich-country firms to reduce their reliance on global supply chains and invest more in robots at home. This is because the pandemic has changed the relative costs of these two production models. Global supply chains have become costlier and more uncertain, with many firms anticipating further lockdown-related disruptions to production. At the same time, the decrease in interest rates during the ongoing economic crisis has enabled cheaper financing, thereby lowering the cost of a robot relative to that of a worker. As a result, firms in developed countries are expected to reshore production – from China, for example – and invest in German or US robots instead. We estimate that the increase in uncertainty owing to the pandemic could reduce global supply-chain activity by 35%. That decrease, coupled with lower interest rates, could boost robot adoption in rich countries by 76% (although here, too, rising uncertainty could deter investment). Whether the switch from supply chains to robots increases productivity growth in advanced economies will depend on whether robots create larger productivity gains than offshore workers do. Fortunately, we have empirical evidence that could point toward an answer. Offshoring production to China or Eastern Europe increased developed-country firms’ productivity, because wages in these regions were much lower than at home. For example, German companies’ use of Eastern European rather than German workers in parts of their supply chains resulted in economy-wide productivity gains that contributed to Germany’s “super-competitiveness.” Estimating the productivity gains from introducing robots is far trickier, because the outcome depends on whether firms use the robots simply to replace workers, or instead reorganize production in order to exploit the potential that AI offers. Doing the latter can create entirely new jobs that foster rapid productivity growth. But recent research by Daron Acemoglu and Pascual Restrepo suggests that US firms nowadays use robots primarily to automate tasks previously performed by workers rather than to create new jobs. They found that between 1947 and 1987, labor displacement as a result of automation was offset by reinstatement of labor into new jobs created by other new technologies. In the last three decades, however, worker displacement has far outpaced reinstatement. As a result, the labor share in US GDP (the share of income that goes to workers) has been declining since the mid-1980s. Firms’ focus on automation may explain why productivity growth has been so anemic in recent years, despite the AI revolution. Moreover, studies of technological innovation suggest that there is a long implementation lag until a new technology’s potential is fully revealed. Applying new technologies takes considerable time, and the more profound and far-reaching the potential restructuring, the longer the time lag between the initial invention and the complete economic impact. The full benefit of the technology often requires time-consuming complementary investments, such as organizational changes. These findings suggest that the pandemic will not start to accelerate productivity growth anytime soon. That in turn has important implications for the future of world trade. In the period of hyper-globalization from 1990 to 2008, global supply chains accounted for 60-70% of the growth in world trade, as rich-country firms relocated production to Eastern Europe and China in order to benefit from lower labor costs. They then imported the inputs manufactured in these regions to their home market, boosting growth in trade in intermediate goods. Supply-chain disruption and reshoring will likely slow world trade unless productivity growth accelerates in advanced economies. If the adoption of robots increases rich-country firms’ productivity, they will become more competitive and produce more. They will thus import more intermediate inputs from developing countries. The World Bank’s Erhan Artuc, Paulo Bastos, and Bob Rijkers argued along these lines in a 2018 paper that presented a more optimistic outlook for world trade. But another recent study shows that robot adoption in the US has led firms to withdraw supply chains from Mexico, eliminating some jobs that previously had been offshored there. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a large, abrupt, and measurable impact on the global economy and firms’ business models. But its effects on productivity growth, possibly highly significant, will take longer to judge.",
            "新冠会加速生产力发展吗？ 慕尼黑—自21世纪中叶以来，发达经济体的生产率增长就一直处于停滞。 从2005~2016年间，美国的年均生产率增长仅为1.3 % ， 还不及1995~2004年间年增长率的一半左右。 纵观其他经合组织国家，年生产率增长也从1995~2004年间的2.3%下降到2005~2015年间的1.1%左右。 鉴于近期数字创新和人工智能的快速发展，这样的缓慢增长似乎是自相矛盾的。 就像埃里克·布林约尔松、丹尼尔·洛克和查德·西维尔森所指出的那样 ， “ 除生产率统计领域外，我们到处都可以看到具有变革性的新技术 。 ” 但2019年新冠疫情是否有助于通过加速企业采用机器人和其他节约劳动力的创新来化解这一矛盾，从而促进生产率的提升？ 近期我参与合著的研究报告显示，疫情已促使越来越多的富国企业减少对全球供应链的依赖，并加大对国内机器人的投资。 究其原因是，疫情已经改变了上述两种生产模式的相对成本。 全球供应链成本越来越高，不确定性也越来越大，许多企业预计，会有进一步与封锁相关的生产破坏活动。 与此同时，当前经济危机期间，利率下降已经导致融资成本降低，从而降低了机器人相对于工人所需要的成本代价。 因此，预计发达国家企业将调整生产布局，例如，从中国撤资，转投德国或美国的机器人。 我们估计，疫情造成的不确定性增加可能会减少35%的全球供应链活动。 上述减少，再加之低利率，可能会使富国的机器人采用率大幅提升76 % （ 尽管在国内，不确定性增加也会对投资起到阻碍作用 ） 。 从供应链到机器人的转型能否提高发达经济体的效率将取决于机器人能否比离岸工人创造更大的生产率增长。 幸运的是，我们已拥有经验证据可以做出回答。 将生产过程外包到中国或东欧提高了发达国家企业的效率，因为这些地区的工资比国内低得多。 例如，德国企业供应链部分使用东欧而非德国劳动者导致了促进德国“超级竞争力”的整个经济领域的生产率提高。 估计引进机器人能带来多大生产率提升要困难得多，因为，最终结果取决于企业只是利用机器人来代替工人，还是为充分发挥人工智能潜力而重组生产过程。 后者可以创造全新的就业机会，并促进生产率的快速提升。 但达隆·阿西莫格鲁和帕斯夸尔·雷斯特雷波最近的研究结果显示，美国企业现在并没有利用机器人来创造全新就业岗位，而是利用其来自动完成以前由工人完成的任务。 他们发现，在1947~1987年间，因自动化而导致的劳动力转移被因其他新技术创造的全新就业机会所带来的劳动力重新上岗所抵消。 结果导致美国 GDP中的劳动力份额（分配给劳动者的收入比例）自20世纪80年代中期以来一直持续下降。 企业对自动化的关注点或许可以解释为什么近年来生产率增长如此疲软，尽管人工智能革命已经爆发。 此外，对技术创新所进行的研究表明，在新技术潜力得到充分发挥之前，实际还存在很长时间的实施滞后。 适用新技术需要相当长的时间，而且，潜在的结构调整意义越深远，从最初发明到充分发挥其经济影响的时间就越长。 充分发挥技术潜力往往需要耗时耗力的补充投资，比方说，组织变革。 上述研究结果表明，疫情短期内不会开始加速生产率增长。 而这反过来又对世界贸易的未来产生深远影响。 在1990~2008年间的超全球化时期，全球供应链占到了世界贸易增长份额的60~70 % ， 因为富裕国家企业为从低劳动力成本中获益，而将生产过程转移到东欧和中国。 而后，他们又将这些地区生产的半成品进口到国内市场，从而导致中间商品贸易增加。 供应链破坏和再次回流将很有可能减缓世界贸易，除非发达经济体生产率加速增长。 如果采用机器人提高了发达国家企业的生产率，那么他们将更具竞争力，生产的产品也更多。 于是他们将从发展中国家进口更多的半成品原料。 世界银行的厄恩·阿图克、保罗·巴斯托斯和鲍勃·里杰克斯曾在2018年一篇论文中提出了上述观点，该论文对世界贸易提出了更加乐观的预估。 但近期另一项研究显示，美国采用机器人已导致企业从墨西哥撤回供应链，从而消除了此前被外包到那里的某些工作。 2019年新冠疫情对全球经济和企业商业模式已经产生了大规模、突如其来和可以度量的影响。 其对生产率增长所产生的效果可能极为重要，但却需要更长的时间来加以衡量。"

            "Will COVID-19 Kill Cash? LONDON – Four years ago, Kenneth Rogoff, a former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, made a powerful case for phasing out paper money. In his book The Curse of Cash, Rogoff argued that much paper money, especially high-denomination banknotes, facilitated tax evasion and fueled the drug trade – all the way down the supply chain: a British study in 1999 found that only four of 500 notes tested in London had no traces of cocaine. Furthermore, the existence of cash constrains monetary policy. It is harder for central banks to implement negative interest rates when investors have the alternative of keeping a safe full of $100 bills. That seemed an abstruse point to some at the time, but the COVID-19 crisis has placed negative rates firmly on the policy agenda in several countries, albeit not yet in the United States. Since Rogoff wrote, cash has been in retreat as a payment mechanism. In Sweden, for example, the demise of the paper krona seems within sight. The mobile payment system Swish dominates the small-denomination landscape. As anyone who has recently tried to buy a beer in Stockholm knows, you will remain thirsty if all you have is a wallet full of cash. And the COVID-19 crisis has given people another reason to steer away from banknotes. It was widely reported that the virus could be transmitted through handling them, prompting many outlets to put up “no cash” signs. In my village, even the traveling fish and chip van will now accept only a contactless card. In fact, there is little or no validity in that scare story. The World Health Organization has said there is no evidence that currency notes transmit coronavirus. The virus lasts just as long on plastic cards, and Christine Tait-Burkard, an infectious disease expert at the University of Edinburgh, said that cash is not a vector of disease “unless someone is using a banknote to sneeze in.” But the damage was done, and in the first month of the crisis cash usage in the United Kingdom fell by over 60%. Transaction volumes halved. In a survey, nearly 75% of respondents said they expect to use cash less in the future. That trend, which has been replicated across the developed world, has given a further boost to digital banking and non-bank payment system providers. Apple Pay and PayPal are doing well. Fintech neobanks have continued to expand their user base, though many question whether they have yet found a sustainable business model. Facebook’s Libra currency is waiting in the wings, with its backers trying to persuade regulators that its model is safe and compliant with anti-money laundering protocols. The further decline of cash has also given greater impetus to central banks’ own work on digital currencies. Through banknotes, citizens and businesses have for centuries been able to hold a direct claim on the central bank. If cash were to disappear, is there not an argument for a central bank digital currency, whether wholesale, retail, or both? The Bank for International Settlements reports that several central banks are actively considering introducing one, though none has yet taken the plunge. The Swedish Riksbank may well be the first, with an e-krona ready to roll. So, is a farewell to cash at hand? Will even the greenback go the way of all flesh? The answer is not so clear. In the first place, while the number of transactions fulfilled through cash transfers has indeed been falling, even at the bottom end of the range, the volume of cash in circulation has in fact continued to rise in many countries. Since the end of last year, according to the BIS, the value of currency in circulation has increased by 8% in Italy, and 7% in the US. Precautionary holdings of cash have risen. It is not only drug dealers and tax evaders who see the attraction of cash as a store of value and who value privacy. Of the largest economies, only China has begun to see an absolute decline in the ratio of physical currency to GDP. There are also signs of a political backlash against the withdrawal of cash handling facilities. The Bank of Canada has asked retailers to continue to accept cash, citing concerns about financial exclusion, as people without access to bank accounts and cards find themselves unable to shop. New York City, San Francisco, and the state of New Jersey have barred retailers from refusing cash. Even in Sweden, the Swishers are not having it all their way. An activist group called Kontantupproret (Cash Rebellion) is now campaigning to sustain poorer consumers’ ability to use paper money. In the UK, the government has published an “access to cash” review, which recommends the mandatory maintenance of a large national fleet of ATMs, even though utilization is falling fast. In sum, it may be too soon to write Dollar Bill’s obituary. Demand for his services remains strong. It may make sense for central banks to offer digital services to nonbanks, perhaps partly to avoid the loss of seigniorage income, which would enrich Facebook, rather than governments, in a Libra-dominated world. But unless central banks wish also to enter the credit allocation business, they will want to avoid large-scale disintermediation of the banking system. I suspect that, for the foreseeable future, we will live in a kind of mixed-economy payment system. Cash will continue to play a role, albeit a more modest one than in the past, alongside a variety of cards and direct digital transfers.",
            "新型冠状病毒会消灭现金吗？ 发自伦敦 — — 四年前，国际货币基金组织前首席经济学家肯尼斯·罗格夫（Kenneth Rogoff）提出了逐步淘汰纸币的有力理由。 他在著作《现金的诅咒》中指出大部分纸币（尤其是大面额纸币）的使用都有利于偷税漏税并助长了毒品交易，甚至贯穿了整条供应链：1999年的一项英国研究在伦敦检测了500张钞票，发现只有其中4张没有可卡因的痕迹。 此外现金的存在也限制了货币政策。 当投资者可以选择在保险箱里装满100美元钞票时，中央银行就很难实施负利率了。 这话对某些人来说似乎有些刺耳，但新型冠状病毒危机已将负利率牢牢置于一些国家的政策议程中，只是暂时还没包括美国。 自从罗格夫发表上述文章之后，现金的支付机制功能一直在萎缩。 例如在瑞典，克朗纸币的消亡似乎近在在眼前。 移动支付系统Swish主导了小面额支付领域。 正如任何近期想在斯德哥尔摩购买啤酒的人所发现的那样，如果你手里只有一个装满现金的钱包，那么这顿酒估计也喝不成了。 而新型冠状病毒危机则为人们提供了另一个远离钞票的理由。 有大量报告指出该病毒可通过钞票传播，导致商家纷纷贴出“不收现金”的标牌。 在我们村子里，就连炸鱼薯条流动售卖车如今都只接受非接触式卡付款。 但其实这个恐怖故事只有极少甚至没有任何证据支撑。 世界卫生组织表示没有证据表明纸币会传播冠状病毒。 该病毒在塑料卡上也能存活同样长的时间，爱丁堡大学传染病专家克里斯汀·泰特-伯卡德（Christine Tait-Burkard）也表示钞票并不是疾病的传播媒介 ， “ 除非有人对着钞票打喷嚏 。 ” 但是破坏已经造成，在危机爆发的第一个月，英国的现金使用量下降了超过60 ％ 。 交易金额也减少了一半。 在一项调查中有近75％的受访者表示未来会减少使用现金。 这种趋势已在发达国家复制蔓延开来，进一步推动了数字银行和非银行支付系统提供商的发展。 Apple Pay和PayPal依然运作良好。 尽管许多人质疑那些新型金融科技银行能否找到可持续的商业模式，但它们仍在继续扩大其用户基础。 Facebook的Libra币已经整装待发，其支持者正努力说服监管机构其模型是安全且符合反洗钱法规的。 现金使用的进一步减少也给中央银行自身在数字货币方面的工作注入了更大动力。 数百年以来公民和企业一直可以通过纸币直接要求中央银行进行偿付。 如果现金即将消亡，那么这岂不是有理由使用央行数字货币，无论是批发，零售还是两者兼而有之？ 国际清算银行报告说，尽管尚未有任何央行冒险尝试此举，但已经有几家央行正在积极考虑引入，在此已经准备好推出电子瑞典克朗的瑞典国家银行可能成为第一个吃螃蟹的人。 那么我们现在就要跟钞票说再见了吗？ 就连美元都会随之消逝吗？ 答案尚不明朗。 首先，尽管通过现金转账完成的交易数量确实不断下降，但实际上许多国家的现金流通金额仍在继续上升。 根据国际清算银行的数据，自去年年底以来流通货币总额在意大利增加了8 ％ ， 美国则增加了7 ％ 。 预防性现金持有量有所增加。 要知道看重现金的价值存储功能且重视隐私的可不仅仅是毒品贩子和逃税者。 在众多大型经济体中，只有中国的实物货币相对GDP的比率出现了绝对下降。 此外还出现了一些在政治上反对撤销现金接收机构的迹象。 比如加拿大银行就要求零售商继续接受现金，担忧因不收现金引发的金融排斥状况会导致那些无法申请银行帐户和卡的人不能购物。 美国的纽约市，旧金山和新泽西州都禁止零售商拒收现金。 即使在瑞典也不是一帆风顺，一个名为Kontantupproret（意为“钞票反抗军 ” ） 的社会活动组织现正在行动起来维护较贫穷消费者使用纸币的能力。 在英国，政府发布了一份“现金获取渠道”审查报告，建议对全国大批ATM机进行强制维护，即便其使用率已经大幅下降。 总而言之，现在撰写纸币的讣告或许还早了一点，因为对其服务的需求仍然强劲。 中央银行向非银行机构提供数字服务也许是合理的，也许在一定程度上是为了避免铸币税收入的损失，从而不至于在一个Libra主导的世界中喂饱了Facebook（而非政府 ） 。 但除非中央银行也希望进入信贷分配业务，否则它们肯定不想与银行系统发生大规模脱钩。 因此我怀疑在可预见的将来我们将生活在一种混合经济支付系统中。 现金将继续发挥作用（尽管与过去相比更为低调 ） ， 并与各种卡和直接数字转账共存。"

            "The Global South’s Pandemic Path to Self-Reliance MELBOURNE – COVID-19 continues to have a devastating impact on public health and to rattle the global economy with structural shocks. The pandemic has now killed more than one million people, while the International Monetary Fund estimates that global GDP will shrink by 4.4% in 2020. But, strange as it may seem, the current crisis could offer developing countries a path toward greater economic self-reliance. This is partly because developed countries have in general borne the brunt of the pandemic’s health effects so far. Many advanced Western economies have experienced more COVID-19 cases and deaths relative to their populations than have developing countries of the Global South, despite their superior health-care systems and stronger social safety nets. For example, India’s health system ranks 112th globally, while that of the United States ranks 37th. But whereas India has so far reported about 6,400 COVID-19 cases per million population, America’s tally is more than four times higher. Some developing countries like Vietnam combated the coronavirus effectively by introducing strict testing, tracing, and quarantine measures at a very early stage – something most developed countries failed to do. Even after allowing for possible underreporting and data inaccuracies in poorer countries, the relative performance of developed economies remains a paradox. Moreover, development financing has already started to plummet as richer countries focus on engineering domestic post-pandemic recoveries. The OECD estimates that external private finance inflows to developing economies could decrease by $700 billion year on year in 2020, exceeding the impact of the 2008 global financial crisis by 60%. Non-resident portfolio outflows from emerging markets totaled $83.3 billion in March 2020 alone, according to the Institute of International Finance. And the OECD thinks global foreign direct investment (FDI) will drop by at least 30% this year, with flows to developing economies likely to fall even more. Such trends imply a grim outlook for Global South countries that historically have largely relied on development aid from the Global North. But studies have shown that development aid and humanitarian assistance do not necessarily foster economic empowerment. A recent OECD survey found that between 48% and 94% of respondents in developing countries do not believe that humanitarian assistance helps them to become economically self-reliant. People want financial autonomy, not prolonged assistance. The debate over the effectiveness of development aid is an old one, with critics claiming that rich countries use aid as a tool to exploit developing economies’ resources, and often attach conditions to ensure that donors reap the bulk of the export receipts. But many developed countries have lost much of their soft power because of their shambolic pandemic responses. Even before COVID-19 struck, many developing economies had been looking for ways to make a sustainable shift from aid dependency to self-reliance. In 2018, Rwanda banned second-hand clothes imports with the aim of encouraging its domestic textile industry to produce higher value-added garments; the US responded by ending the country’s duty-free export privileges. And last year, the United Kingdom’s government allocated part of its £14 billion ($18.5 billion) aid budget to capacity-building projects intended to help developing countries increase their international trade and attract FDI. Today, developing countries have more opportunities to become self-reliant. For starters, trade in developing East Asia has declined less sharply than in the West during the pandemic, according to the World Trade Organization. A key reason for this is that industries producing high value-added goods usually suffer more during downturns. Developing countries’ greater resilience, stemming from their reliance on low value-added manufacturing, is evident in Vietnam’s textile and garments sector, which has remained operational throughout the pandemic and is expected to have a swifter recovery in 2021 compared to their regional competitors. Second, digitization will play a crucial role in the post-pandemic recovery by significantly boosting e-commerce, which implies a fairer competitive playing field for producers around the world. Bangladesh’s e-commerce sector grew by 26% year on year by August, and other South Asian countries show a similar trend. Third, the health-care and pharmaceuticals sectors are expected to thrive in the post-pandemic economy as people become more aware of the importance of health and fitness. Least developed countries can take advantage of World Trade Organization provisions by producing more generic drugs, which face no patent-related obstacles. Finally, governments in the Global South can mobilize domestic resources to offset the decline in external development finance – in particular by transforming their tax policies to generate revenue from fast-growing digital economic activities. Currently, developing countries’ low levels of tax revenue as a share of GDP – typically between 10-20%, compared to 40% in high-income countries – hinder development by constraining governments’ ability to invest in public goods like health, infrastructure, and education. Developing countries face several hurdles on the path to self-reliance, not least poor governance, unfavorable business climates, and civil conflicts. But they also must break with the post-1945 paradigm of external development finance, which has been primarily driven by the Global North and shaped by its geopolitical agenda. For far too long, developing countries have had to listen to lectures from those who think they know better. Today, developing-country governments must chart a development agenda that is free from donor conditionality. Every crisis contains great opportunities, and the COVID-19 pandemic is no different. It offers developing countries nothing less than the chance to reinvent and reboot their economies – and to shake off the disabling legacy of external aid dependency.",
            "全球南方自力更生的疫情之路 墨尔本—COVID-19仍然再给公共卫生造成灾难性影响，通过结构性冲击肆虐全球经济。 目前，疫情已经杀死了一百万多人，而国际货币基金组织（IMF）估计2020年全球GDP将萎缩 4.4 % 。 但看上去也许不可思议，当前危机可以为发展中国家带来一条提高经济自力更生程度之路。 部分原因在于，发达国家总体上承受了疫情的大部分健康影响。 按人口比例衡量，许多发达西方经济体的COVID-19病例和死亡数要高于全球南方的发展中国家，尽管它们拥有更强的医疗体系和社会安全网。 比如，印度卫生体系全球排名第112，而美国排名为37。 印度目前报告每一百万人口COVID-19病例数为69例，而美国是这个数字的四倍。 越南等一些发展中国家通过尽早采取严格的检测、跟踪和隔离措施，有效地阻击了新冠病毒，而大部分发达国家做不到这一点。 即使考虑到穷国可能存在低报和数据不准确，发达经济体的相对表现仍然让人难以理解。 此外，随着富裕国家专注于本国疫情后复苏，发展融资也已经开始大幅下降。 经合组织估计，2020年流入发展中经济体的外部私人资金同比降幅可能高达7000亿美元，比2008年全球金融危机的影响还要大60 % 。 据国际金融研究所（Institute of International Finance）2020年3月一个月，新兴市场非居民投资组合外流规模就高达833 亿美元。 经合组织认为，全球外国直接投资（FDI）今年至少下降30 % ， 发展中经济体流入规模可能降得更多。 这些趋势意味着，传统上严重依靠全球北方的发展援助的全球南方国家前景不妙。 但研究表明，发展援助和人道主义援助未必会形成经济赋能。 最新经合组织调查发现，48—94%的发展中国家受访者不认为人道主义援提高了他们的经济自给率。 人们希望财务自立，而不是长期靠援助度日。 关于发展援助的效果的争论是老生常谈，批评者说，富裕国家把援助当成掠夺发展中经济体资源的工具，常常带有附加条件以确保援助国能获得大部分出口收益。 但许多发达国家因为拙劣的疫情应对而软实力大减。 在COVID-19爆发前，许多发展中经济体便一直在寻找办法可持续地摆脱援助依赖，实现自力更生。 2018年，卢旺达禁止进口二手服装，旨在鼓励本国纺织业生产附加值更高的产品；美国为此撤销了卢旺达的免税待遇。 去年，英国政府将其140亿英镑的援助预算的一部分用于能力构建项目，旨在帮助发展中国家提高国际贸易和吸引FDI。 如今，发展中国家有了更多机会实现自力更生。 首先，据世贸组织数据，疫情期间，发展中的东亚的贸易萎缩幅度显著低于西方。 一个关键原因是生产高增加值产品的行业常常会在衰退中遭到更多的损失。 发展中国家自立能力的提高源自它们猪獒依靠低增加值制造业，越南纺织和服装业便是明证，其在整个疫情期间都保持开工，预计在2021年将取得比地区竞争对手更快的恢复。 其次，数字化将在疫情后复苏中起到关键作用，大大提振电子商务，而这意味着全世界生产商将在更公平的环境中竞争。 截至8月，孟加拉国电子商务行业同比增长了26 % ， 其他南亚国家也出现了类似的趋势。 第三，随着更多人意识到健康的重要性，医疗和制药行业预计将在疫情后经济中繁荣。 最不发达国家能够利用世贸组织规则，生产更多的非专利药，不必面对专利壁垒。 最后，全球南方政府可以动员国内资源抵消外部发展融资的下降 — — 特别是改变税收政策，从迅速增长的数字经济活动中获得收入。 目前，发展中国家税收收入占GDP比例较低 — — 通常只有10-20 % ， 而高收入国家在40%左右 — — 这制约了政府投资于健康、基础设施和教育的公共品的能力，从而拖累发展。 发展中国家在通往自力更生的道路上面临着不少障碍，包括治理水平低、营商环境差、内战冲突等。 但它们还必须打破1945年以来的外部发展融资范式，即主要由全球北方推动，依据全球北方的地缘政治日程设计。 太长时间以来，发展中国家不得不听命于自以为是的发达国家。 如今，发展中国家政府制定发展日程必须摆脱出资条件。 每一场危机都孕育着大机会，COVID-19疫情也不例外。 它为发展中国家提供了一次机会，让经济重新出发 — — 并摆脱外部援助依赖这一痼疾。"

            "Will COVID-19 Remake the World? CAMBRIDGE – Crises come in two variants: those for which we could not have prepared, because no one had anticipated them, and those for which we should have been prepared, because they were in fact expected. COVID-19 is in the latter category, no matter what US President Donald Trump says to avoid responsibility for the unfolding catastrophe. Even though the coronavirus itself is new and the timing of the current outbreak could not have been predicted, it was well recognized by experts that a pandemic of this type was likely. SARS, MERS, H1N1, Ebola, and other outbreaks had provided ample warning. Fifteen years ago, the World Health Organization revised and upgraded the global framework for responding to outbreaks, trying to fix perceived shortcomings in the global response experienced during the SARS outbreak in 2003. In 2016, the World Bank launched a Pandemic Emergency Financing Facility to provide assistance to low-income countries in the face of cross-border health crises. Most glaringly, just a few months before COVID-19 emerged in Wuhan, China, a US government report cautioned the Trump administration about the likelihood of a flu pandemic on the scale of the influenza epidemic a hundred years ago, which killed an estimated 50 million people worldwide. Just like climate change, COVID-19 was a crisis waiting to happen. The response in the United States has been particularly disastrous. Trump downplayed the severity of the crisis for weeks. By the time infections and hospitalizations began to soar, the country found itself severely short of test kits, masks, ventilators, and other medical supplies. The US did not request test kits made available by the WHO, and failed to produce reliable tests early on. Trump declined to use his authority to requisition medical supplies from private producers, forcing hospitals and state authorities to scramble and compete against one another to secure supplies. Delays in testing and lockdowns have been costly in Europe as well, with Italy, Spain, France, and the United Kingdom paying a high price. Some countries in East Asia have responded a lot better. South Korea, Singapore, and Hong Kong appear to have controlled the spread of the disease through a combination of testing, tracing, and strict quarantine policies. Interesting contrasts have emerged within countries as well. In northern Italy, Veneto has done much better than nearby Lombardy, largely owing to more comprehensive testing and earlier imposition of travel restrictions. In the US, the neighboring states of Kentucky and Tennessee reported their first cases of COVID-19 within a day of each other. By the end of March, Kentucky had only a quarter of the number of cases as Tennessee, because the state acted much more quickly to declare a state of emergency and close down public accommodations. For the most part, though, the crisis has played out in ways that could have been anticipated from the prevailing nature of governance in different countries. Trump’s incompetent, bumbling, self-aggrandizing approach to managing the crisis could not have been a surprise, as lethal as it has been. Likewise, Brazil’s equally vain and mercurial president, Jair Bolsonaro, has, true to form, continued to downplay the risks. On the other hand, it should come as no surprise that governments have responded faster and more effectively where they still command significant public trust, such as in South Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan. China’s response was typically Chinese: suppression of information about the prevalence of the virus, a high degree of social control, and a massive mobilization of resources once the threat became clear. Turkmenistan has banned the word “coronavirus,” as well as the use of masks in public. Hungary’s Viktor Orbán has capitalized on the crisis by tightening his grip on power, by disbanding parliament after giving himself emergency powers without time limit. The crisis seems to have thrown the dominant characteristics of each country’s politics into sharper relief. Countries have in effect become exaggerated versions of themselves. This suggests that the crisis may turn out to be less of a watershed in global politics and economics than many have argued. Rather than putting the world on a significantly different trajectory, it is likely to intensify and entrench already-existing trends. Momentous events such as the current crisis engender their own “confirmation bias”: we are likely to see in the COVID-19 debacle an affirmation of our own worldview. And we may perceive incipient signs of a future economic and political order we have long wished for. So, those who want more government and public goods will have plenty of reason to think the crisis justifies their belief. And those who are skeptical of government and decry its incompetence will also find their prior views confirmed. Those who want more global governance will make the case that a stronger international public-health regime could have reduced the costs of the pandemic. And those who seek stronger nation-states will point to the many ways in which the WHO seem to have mismanaged its response (for example, by taking China’s official claims at face value, opposing travel bans, and arguing against masks). In short, COVID-19 may well not alter – much less reverse – tendencies evident before the crisis. Neoliberalism will continue its slow death. Populist autocrats will become even more authoritarian. Hyper-globalization will remain on the defensive as nation-states reclaim policy space. China and the US will continue on their collision course. And the battle within nation-states among oligarchs, authoritarian populists, and liberal internationalists will intensify, while the left struggles to devise a program that appeals to a majority of voters.",
            "2019冠状病毒病能否重塑世界？ 剑桥—危机有两种：一种是我们未曾防备的，因为意想不到；另一种是我们应当设防的，因为事实上我们已经有所预料。 无论美国总统唐纳德•特朗普(Donald Trump)为了逃避对这场灾难承担责任而作何发言，2019冠状病毒病都属于后一类危机。 尽管冠状病毒本身是新出现的，而且疫情的爆发时间无法预测，但专家们都已经认为，这种类型的疫情很可能发生。 非典、中东呼吸综合征、H1N1、埃博拉和其他疾病的爆发已经多次敲响警钟。 15年前，世界卫生组织修订和升级了应对疫情的全球机制，以修正2003年非典爆发期间全球应对措施的明显缺陷。 2016年，世界银行启动了流行病应急融资基金，向面临跨境卫生危机的低收入国家提供援助。 最引人注目的是，就在冠状病毒疫情在中国武汉爆发的几个月前，一份美国政府部门报告已警告了特朗普政府，指出类似100年前那场大流感规模的流感疫情或将再次出现，而那场大流感曾导致全球约5, 000万人死亡。 正如气候变化一样，2019冠状病毒病的危机也不可避免。 而美国的应对尤具破坏力。 特朗普数周来一直在淡化危机的严重性。 当感染病例和入院人数开始激增时，美国的检测工具、口罩，呼吸机和其他医疗用品开始出现严重短缺。 美国没有要求世界卫生组织提供检测试剂盒，也未能在早期进行可靠的检测。 特朗普拒绝行使总统权力从私人生产商那里征用医疗用品，这迫使医院和政府相互抢夺和竞争，以确保物资供应。 欧洲国家也为拖延检测和封锁付出了高昂的代价，意大利、西班牙、法国和英国损失巨大。 而东亚一些国家的应对措施成效显著。 韩国，新加坡和香港通过采取检疫、追踪和严格的隔离政策等一系列措施，似乎已经控制住了疫情。 各国地方层面也出现了耐人寻味的对比。 在意大利北部，威尼托的疫情防控情况要比邻近的伦巴第好得多，这在很大程度上要归功于更全面的检疫措施和更早实施的旅行限制。 在美国，邻近的肯塔基州和田纳西州在同一天内相继报告了首例感染病例。 到3月底，肯塔基州的病例数仅占田纳西州的四分之一，这是因为该州宣布进入紧急状态和关闭公共场所的速度要快得多。 不过，在很大程度上，危机的演变方式可以通过不同国家各自的治理模式进行预测。 特朗普应对危机的无能、笨手笨脚、自我膨胀的方式尽管致命，却并不令人意外。 与特朗普同样自负而反复无常的巴西总统雅伊尔•梅希亚斯•博索纳罗(Jair Bolsonaro)也一如既往地继续淡化风险。 另一方面，在韩国、新加坡和台湾等仍然维持着政府公信力的地区，采取疫情防控措施的速度更快、效果更好也就不足为奇了。 中国的应对措施是典型的中国风格：压制关于病毒传播的消息，实施高度的社会控制，一旦威胁扩大，就大规模调动资源。 土库曼斯坦已禁止使用“冠状病毒”一词，并禁止在公共场合佩戴口罩。 匈牙利总理欧尔班•维克托(Orbán Viktor)利用此次危机加强了集权，在授予自己无时限的紧急权力后解散了议会。 这场危机似乎让各国政治的主要特征更加鲜明。 实际上，国家已经变成了原有模式的加强版。 这表明，这场危机可能并不像许多人所认为的那样，是全球政治和经济的分水岭。 它可能会加剧并巩固已存在的趋势，而不是将世界领入一个崭新的发展轨道。 像本次疫情一样的重大事件形成了它们自己的“证实偏差 ” ： 我们很可能在战胜疫病的过程中获得对自身世界观的肯定。 我们也许会看到渴望已久的未来经济和政治秩序的雏形。 因此，那些希望获得更多政府和公共产品的人将有充足的理由认为，这场危机支持了他们的信念。 那些对政府持怀疑态度并谴责政府无能的人也会发现他们先前的观点得到了证实。 那些希望加强全球治理的人将借此证明，一个更强大的国际公共卫生体制本可以降低疫情防控的成本。 而那些希望建立更强大的民族国家的人则会指出，世界卫生组织在许多方面似乎应对不力(例如，仅从表面理解中国官方声明，反对旅行禁令，反对佩戴口罩 ) 。 简而言之，2019冠状病毒病很可能不会改变危机之前就已明显存在的趋势，更不用说逆转。 新自由主义将继续缓慢消亡。 民粹主义独裁者将变得更加专制。 随着民族国家收回政策空间，超全球化将继续处于守势。 中国和美国的冲突将持续。 民族国家内部的寡头、威权民粹主义者和自由国际主义者之间的斗争将会加剧，而左派则在尽力设计一个能够吸引大多数选民的方案。"

            "Will Universities Learn from Lockdowns? CAMBRIDGE – Will COVID-19 finally trigger a long-overdue technological disruption of higher education? Throughout the world, sudden mid-semester lockdowns aimed at combating the pandemic forced universities to switch to distance learning almost overnight. But while this rapid transition has been tough for faculty and students alike, some good might yet come of it. Like many businesses, universities are struggling with how to reopen and are adopting a range of strategies. For example, the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom has announced that its lectures will be online-only until at least the summer of 2021. Others, including Stanford University, are offering a mix of in-person and online classes, as well as spreading out their academic year so that fewer students will be on campus at any time. Make no mistake: COVID-19 represents a massive economic hit to higher education. Dorm rooms are unoccupied, sports stadiums remain empty, and students push back against paying full tuition fees. For many colleges and universities, the drop in revenue from foreign students, especially Chinese, is likely to be painful; numerous smaller and less-endowed schools may close. Even top universities face challenges. The University of Michigan anticipates a pandemic-induced loss of up to $1 billion by the end of 2020, while Harvard University is projecting a $750 million revenue shortfall for next year. But will the COVID-19 shock ultimately help to bring about better education for more people at lower cost? The answer will depend partly on whether universities push technology aside as the pandemic fades, or instead look for the best ways to harness it. This is not an easy challenge, given the importance of interactions among professors, graduate students, and undergraduates, both inside and outside of class. When I was a graduate student 40 years ago, I was convinced that video learning (the technology of the day) would reshape university teaching. After all, I thought, why shouldn’t students around the world have access to the best lecturers and materials, particularly given that on-campus lectures to 200 students or more offer extremely limited scope for personal interaction anyway? To be sure, in-class teaching would still have an important role to play. Professors would still curate materials and answer questions. And I did not envisage recorded lectures substituting for smaller classes (although taped materials can of course work in that setting, too). But while it is thrilling to watch a great class in person, surely a good taped lecture is better than a mediocre in-person one. Fast forward four decades, however, and progress has been limited. One likely reason is university governance: faculty run these institutions, and few are inclined to go down a path that would reduce demand for their services. Professors are no doubt also worried that taped classes would make it harder for their graduate students to find jobs. And graduate students, with their energy and fresh ideas, are key drivers of research. Demographic shifts have long been putting downward pressure on college enrollments. Even if faculty in some fields (such as computer science) still see robust demand, for many others, declining student numbers surely amplifies resistance to labor-saving new technologies. But perhaps the biggest obstacle is the high cost of producing high-quality taped lectures that satisfy students as much as in-person classes. Producing even a single lecture for mass consumption is a risky and time-consuming proposition. And because recorded lectures are so easily cloned, it may be difficult to charge a high enough price to cover the costs. A plethora of education startups (including many in and around the Boston area, where I live) are trying to solve these problems, but so far have not had a major impact on the system. It therefore seems reasonable to ask whether the United States government should take on the costs of creating basic pre-taped or online college lecture materials in certain fields. (The same could be done for adult education courses.) In particular, introductory online course materials in apolitical subjects such as mathematics, computer science, physics, and accounting should be prime candidates for federal funding. Many other academic disciplines, certainly including my own field of economics, also have great online potential. Democratic US presidential candidate Joe Biden now supports making college free, which thrills some professors. But, rather than expanding the existing US university system, wouldn’t federal funding for online learning be a fairer and more efficient way forward, especially given that it can help adults of all ages? Higher education endows students with an array of important life skills and understanding, helps them to lead richer and fuller lives, and, one hopes, makes them better citizens. But it is far from obvious that all of higher education’s different aspects, including skills acquisition and social and intellectual development, need to be bundled together in the way they are now. Students need to gather, but not necessarily all the time. Virtually everyone agrees that broadening access to higher education is one of the best ways to mitigate inequality, and that it can help to make society fairer and more productive. It is also essential in a world where technology and globalization (or nowadays perhaps deglobalization) require greater adaptability and possibly retraining to meet shifting labor-market demand. The COVID-19 crisis is likely to bring about further rapid and far-reaching shifts in the economic ground beneath us. But we need not view these changes with dread if the pandemic also propels a transition to better and more universal higher education.",
            "各大院校可以从封锁中学到什么？ 发自剑桥—新型冠状病毒最终会在高等教育领域引发一场姗姗来迟的技术性颠覆吗？ 在学期中段忽然下达的封锁抗疫措施迫使全球各大院校几乎在一夜之间全部转入远程教学。 尽管教师和学生一时都难以适应这种快速转变，但此举或许还能对我们有所裨益。 跟许多企业一样，大学也纠结于如何重开并相应采取了一系列策略。 比如英国剑桥大学就宣布至少在2021年夏季之前都只会在网上授课。 而包括斯坦福大学在内的其他学府则会将现场教学和在线课程相结合并将学年拉长，以确保校园里的学生人数在任何时间都维持在一个较低数量。 新型冠状病毒确实对高等教育产生了巨大的经济冲击。 宿舍区空无一人，体育馆门可罗雀，学生也不愿缴交全额学费。 对于许多高校而言，因为外国学生（尤其是中国留学生）减少导致的收入下降可能会很难熬。 许多规模较小资金不足的学校可能被迫停办。 甚至连那些顶级学府也面临挑战。 密歇根大学预计到2020年底因疫情导致的损失可能高达10亿美元，而哈佛大学则预计明年收入将减少7.5亿美元。 但这场新型冠状病毒冲击最终能否以更低成本来为更多人带来更优质的教育？ 答案将部分取决于大学会否随着疫情逐渐消退而将相关技术搁置一旁，还是寻求最佳方式去利用这些技术。 鉴于教授，研究生和本科生在课堂内外互动的重要性，这可不是一个容易解决的挑战。 在我读研究生的时候（40年前 ） ， 我确信视频学习（也是当时最热门的技术）将重塑大学教学。 我觉得为什么不能让全世界学生都获得最好的讲师和教材，尤其是考虑到在校内面向200或更多学生的教学再怎么样也只能提供极端有限的个人互动空间。 可以肯定的是，课堂教学仍将发挥重要作用。 教授仍会整理教学材料并回答问题。 而且我当时也并未设想视频课程可以代替小班授课（尽管录制的材料当然也可以被应用于那种情景 ） 。 但虽然亲身聆听一堂精彩课程确实令人兴奋，但可靠的录像课程肯定要比平庸的面对面授课要好。 但当我们把时间快进了40年后，进展却依然有限。 一个原因可能来自于大学的治理体系：教授们运行着这些机构，而他们中很少有人愿意走上一条减少对自身服务需求的路径。 教授们无疑还会担心视频授课会导致其研究生更难找到工作，而这些充满活力和新鲜想法的研究生生们正是研究的主要动力。 长期以来，人口结构变化一直对大学入学率构成下行压力。 即便某些领域（例如计算机科学）对教师的需求仍然旺盛，但对其他许多领域而言学生数量的下降肯定会导致人们加大力度抵制那些节省劳动力的新技术。 但最大的障碍也许在于制作可以让学生感觉如同当面授课的高质量视频课程需要付出极为高昂的成本。 就算只针对大众消费去制作一堂课也是一项冒险且耗时的提议。 而且由于录制的课程很容易被盗版，因此可能难以收取足够多的学费来支付制作费用。 许多教育类初创企业（其中很多位于我居住的波士顿地区及其周边）都在试图解决这些问题，但目前为止还未能对整个体系产生重大影响。 因此问题大概可以转换为是否应该由美国政府去承担在某些领域中创建预录制或在线基础大学讲座材料的费用 — — 也可以推广到成人教育课程上。 特别是诸如数学，计算机科学，物理和会计等一些非政治性学科的入门在线课程材料应该是联邦资助的主要候选科目。 而许多其他学科，当然包括我自己所在的经济学领域，也都具有巨大的在线潜力。 美国民主党总统候选人乔·拜登如今声言支持大学免学费政策，这使一些教授感到振奋。 但与其扩大现有的美国大学系统，联邦政府对在线学习（尤其鉴于这可以帮助所有年龄段的成年人）的资助难道不是一种更为公平有效的进步吗？ 高等教育赋予学生一系列重要生活技能和领悟，可以帮助他们过上更加丰富充实的生活，也使他们有机会成为更优秀的公民。 但我们并不清楚高等教育的所有不同方面，包括技能获取以及社会和智力发展，是否都需要以目前的方式捆绑在一起。 学生们需要聚在一起，但不一定每时每刻都要在一起。 几乎每个人都同意扩大高等教育机会是减轻不平等现象的最佳手段之一，它可以帮助社会变得更加公平，使生产力得到提升。 由于当今世界的技术和全球化（如今可能是去全球化）都需要人们具备更强适应能力甚至可能需要重新培训以满足不断变化的劳动力市场需求，因此扩大高等教育机会也是有必要的。 新型冠状病毒危机很可能使我们的经济基础进一步发生快速而深远的变化。 但如果疫情也推动了向更优质普遍高等教育的过渡，那我们也就不必畏惧这些变化了。"

            "Are Emerging Markets the Canary in the Financial Coal Mine? BUENOS AIRES – Are brewing exchange-rate and debt crises in Argentina and Turkey localized events without broader implications? Or are they early warning signs of deeper fragilities in bloated global debt markets that are being exposed as the US Federal Reserve continues to normalize interest rates? Rising interest rates could test stability in some advanced economies as well, especially in Italy, where voters, particularly in the less developed south, have opted decisively for a disruptive populist government. With an economy ten times the size of Greece, a default in Italy would blow up the eurozone. Indeed, the populist coalition government that has now taken power has hinted that it wants write-offs for some of its under-the-table debts (not included in Italy’s official public debt of over 130% of GDP) to the euro system through the European Central Bank. The good news is that a full-blown global debt crisis is still relatively unlikely to erupt. Even with a recent softening of European performance, the overall global economic picture remains strong, with most regions of the world still growing briskly. Although it is true that several emerging-market firms have piled up worrisome quantities of dollar-denominated external debt, many foreign central banks are brimming with dollar assets, especially in Asia. The International Monetary Fund, moreover, has sufficient resources to handle a first wave of crises, even if it includes, say, Brazil. The main concern is not that the IMF will fail to deliver funds, but that it will make the same mistake it did in Greece, by not imposing a realistic deal on debtors and creditors. As for Italy, chances are that Europe will find a way to grant temporarily some of the extra budget slack the new government seeks, even if there is no way eurozone officials can allow high-debt Italy simply to destroy the common currency. The most important reason for optimism, notwithstanding all the surrounding political noise, is that global long-term real interest rates are still extremely low. Even with all the drama surrounding Fed tightening, 30-year inflation-indexed Treasury bills are paying around 1% – far below long-term real returns, which have averaged closer to 3%. As long as the underlying global interest-rate picture is so benign, it is hard to see the big Kahuna of bond-default waves coming just yet. It is notable how much the IMF, the world’s debt and financial crisis watchdog, has been ratcheting up its warnings. After years of saying advanced countries no longer need to worry about their near-record public-debt levels – now averaging over 100% for general government debt – the IMF has started to warn that many countries may find themselves squeezed for fiscal space if faced with a new recession anytime soon. The challenges stem not only from debt that is on the books, but also from hidden liabilities, owing most notably to massively underfunded old-age pension and health-care programs – implicit debts that in many cases are far larger than the official figures. The overwhelming evidence of recent research supports the IMF view. Countries with historically high debt levels have (on average) significantly poorer growth performance in the face of major shocks, and the long-term relation between high public debt and growth is distinctly negative. This, of course, says absolutely nothing about the economic consequences of actively reducing the burden of government debt, popularly known as “austerity.” Deep recessions are the time to use a country’s war chest, not the time to build it up. Admittedly, there are those on both the left and the right who think “this time is different” for advanced economies. With no realistic danger (in their view) of a major war or financial crisis anytime soon, it is folly to exercise too much restraint on public debt or pension promises. This is dangerous thinking even for the United States, despite the greater fiscal scope it enjoys as the issuer of the global reserve currency. Very bad shocks can happen to any economy, and their sources might not be the ones we normally consider. For example, risks stemming from cyberattacks (especially by state actors), pandemics, and certainly financial crises are probably far higher than anyone would like to admit. It is certainly not difficult to imagine a temporary slowdown in fast-growing China that could roil world markets. And if the completely unexpected does happen, one thing we can anticipate is that governments with strong access to global credit markets will have much better options for responding. Even if the best bet is that any emerging-market bond meltdown would remain contained, today’s jitters ought to be a wake-up call, even for advanced economies. After all, no country, however rich, should bet its future on the prospect that today’s ultra-benign interest-rate environment will last forever. Economists who assure us that advanced-economy debt is completely “safe” sound eerily like those who touted the “Great Moderation” – the supposedly permanent reduction in cyclical volatility – a generation ago. In many cases, they are the same people. But, as we saw a decade ago, and will inevitably see again, we are not at the “End of History” when it comes to global debt and financial crises.",
            "新兴市场是金融煤矿中的金丝雀吗？ 布宜诺斯艾利斯—在阿根廷和土耳其不断发酵的汇率和债务危机是不会产生更大影响的局部事件吗？ 还是早期预警型号，表明高处不胜寒的全球债务市场存在深度脆弱性，随着美联储利率正常化政策的额继续，这些脆弱性正在暴露？ 升息对于一些发达经济体也是稳定性的考验，特别是在意大利。 意大利选民，尤其是较不发达的南方地区的选民，断然决然地选择了一个破坏性民粹主义政府。 意大利经济规模是希腊的十倍，它如果违约将引爆欧元区。 事实上，目前已经掌权的民粹主义执政联盟暗示它希望减记部分通过欧洲央行欠下的秘密欧元体系债务（不包括在意大利超过GDP的130%的官方公共债务中 ） 。 好消息是全面全球债务危机爆发的可能性仍相对较低。 即使最近欧洲表现欠佳，总体全球经济状况仍然坚挺，大部分地区增长仍然喜人。 诚然，一些新兴市场企业累积的美元计价外债数量令人担忧，但许多外国央行拥有充足的美元资产，特别是亚洲。 此外，国际货币基金组织（IMF）有充足的资源应对第一波危机，即使其中包括（比如）巴西。 主要问题不是IMF无法提供资金，而是它重蹈在希腊身上犯过的错误，没有让债务国和债权人达成现实的协议。 对于意大利，最有可能的情况是欧洲找到办法临时为新政府提供一些它所寻求的额外预算豁免，即使欧元区官员绝不会允许负债累累的意大利毁掉共同货币。 身处政治噪声中保持乐观的最重要的理由是全球长期真实利率仍然低到极点。 在美联储紧缩导致全球反应的情况下，30年期通胀指数美国国债的利率仍然只有1%左右 — — 远低于平均接近3%的长期真实回报率。 只要全球利率背景保持如此有利，很难想象会立即发生大规模债券违约。 引人注目的是，世界债务和金融危机监督员IMF是如何修正它的警告的。 多年来，IMF一直表示发达国家不再需要担心接近纪录的公共债务水平 — — 目前平均高达一般政府债务的100%以上 — — 如今，IMF开始警告许多国家如果面临新的衰退，财政操作的空间将十分吃紧。 挑战不仅来自账面上的债务，也来自隐藏负债，其中最主要的来源是大规模亏空的高龄退休金和医保计划 — — 这些隐性债务在许多国家比官方数字大得多。 最新研究提出了压倒性证据支持IMF的观点。 债务水平创造历史记录的国家（平均而言）在面临重大冲击时的增长表现显著更低，高公共债务水平和增长之间的相关性也显著为负。 当然，这完全不能说明积极降低政府债务负担 — — 即人们所熟知的“紧缩 — — ”的经济后果。 深度衰退是动用而不是构建一国备战资金的时候。 诚然，左翼和右翼都有人认为发达各经济体“这次不一样 ” 。 在他们看来，近期不存在切实的大战或金融危机危险，对公共债务或退休金承诺横加限制是愚蠢的。 即便对于美国来说，这种思维也相当危险，尽管作为全球储备货币发行者，美国拥有更大的财政空间。 任何经济体都有可能受到非常糟糕的冲击，这些冲击可能并非来自我们通常所考虑的源头。 比如，来自网络攻击（尤其是国家行动方发动的网络攻击 ） 、 流行病以及（当然包括）金融危机的风险也许要远高于所有人愿意承认的程度。 高速增长的中国暂时减速导致世界市场动荡的情形绝非难以想象。 而如果真的发生了出乎意料的情况，可以预期能够轻松进入全球信用市场的国家将拥有好得多的应对选择。 即使最有可能发生的事情是新兴市场债券崩溃无论如何都不会掀起大波澜，今天的精神过敏也应该作为警报，发达经济体也不能例外。 毕竟，不论一个国家多么富裕，都不应该把未来寄托在今天的极端有利的利率环境能够永远持续上。 那些向我们保证发达经济体债务完全“安全”的经济学家和那些一代人之前鼓吹“大稳健 ” — —周期性波动永久性降低 — — 的经济学家有如一丘之貉。 在很大程度上，他们是同一拨人。 但和十年前一样，并且未来也将是如此，对于全球债务和金融危机，我们并没有站在“历史的终点 ” 。"

            "Will Europe Be Willing but Disabled? NEWPORT BEACH – When it comes to describing Europe’s ever-worsening crisis, metaphors abound. For some, it is five minutes to midnight; for others, Europe is a car accelerating towards the edge of a cliff. For all, a perilous existential moment is increasingly close at hand. Optimists – fortunately, there remain a few, especially in Europe itself – believe that when the situation becomes really critical, political leaders will turn things around and put Europe back on the path of economic growth, job creation, and financial stability. But pessimists have been growing in number and influence. They see political dysfunction adding to financial turmoil, thereby amplifying the eurozone’s initial design flaws. Of course, who is ultimately proven correct is a function of eurozone governments’ willingness to make the difficult decisions that are required, and in a coordinated and timely fashion. But that is not the only determinant: governments must also be able to turn things around once the willingness to do so materializes. And here, the endless delays are making the challenges more daunting and the outcome more uncertain. Experienced observers remind us that crises, rather than vision, have tended to drive progress at critical stages of Europe’s historic integration – a multi-decade journey driven by the desire to ensure long-term peace and prosperity in what previously had been one of the world’s most violent regions and the site of appalling human suffering. After all, the European Union (including the eurozone’s 17 members) remains a collective of nation-states with notable divergences in economic, financial, and social conditions. Cultural differences persist. Political cycles are far from synchronized. And too many regional governance mechanisms, with the important exception of the European Central Bank, lack sufficient influence, credibility, and, therefore, effectiveness. Left to its own devices, such a grouping is vulnerable to recurrent bickering, disruptive posturing, and disagreement over visions of the future. As a result, progress towards meaningful economic and political integration can be painfully slow during the good times. But all of this can change rapidly when a crisis looms, especially if it threatens the integrity of the European project. That is where the eurozone is today. A debt crisis that erupted in Greece, the eurozone’s outer periphery, has migrated with a vengeance towards the core, so much so that the survival of the eurozone itself is at stake. The more the policy response has lagged, the broader the set of questions about Europe’s future has become. Maintaining a 17-member monetary union is no longer a given. Talk of countries exiting, starting with Greece (the “Grexit”), is now rampant. And only hard-core idealists dismiss altogether the mounting risk of the eurozone’s total disintegration. Nonetheless, many veterans of the European integration project see a silver lining in the dark clouds massing over their creation. For them, only a crisis can stop politicians from just kicking various cans farther down the road and, instead, catalyze the policy initiatives – greater fiscal, banking, and political union – that, together with monetary union, would ensure that the eurozone rests on a stable and sustainable four-legged platform. But this view is not without its own risks. It assumes that, when push comes to shove, political leaders will indeed do what is necessary – the willingness question. It also presumes that they will have the capacity to do so – the ability question. And, over time, uncertainty concerning the latter question has risen to an uncomfortable level. Today’s eurozone is beset by an unprecedented degree of rejection – on economic, financial, political, and social grounds – by citizens in a growing number of countries. The longer this persists, the harder it will be for politicians to maintain control of their countries’ destinies and that of Europe’s collective enterprise. Private-sector activity is slowing, and it is nearing a standstill in the eurozone’s most vulnerable economy (Greece), where a bank run is in full swing. Elsewhere, too, depositors are beginning to transfer their savings to the strongest economy (Germany) and to safe havens beyond (Switzerland and the United States). Weaker companies are shedding labor, while stronger firms are delaying investments in plant and equipment. And global investors continue to exit the eurozone in droves, shifting countries’ liabilities to taxpayers and the ECB’s balance sheet. No wonder that social unrest is evident in a growing number of countries. No wonder that fringe political movements are gaining traction throughout the eurozone. And no wonder that voters in almost two-thirds of eurozone countries have turned out the incumbents in their most recent elections. All of this serves to undermine the effectiveness of government policies – by reducing their credibility, clogging their channels of transmission to the economy, and making it difficult to offset the withdrawal of private-sector capital and spending. As a result, the market-based economic and financial systems that prevail in Europe, and that, not so long ago, were a source of significant strength, are losing their vibrancy. I, too, am fond of metaphors. During a trip to the continent last week, I heard one that captures very well the key dynamic in Europe today. The eurozone’s leaders are on a raft heading towards a life-threatening waterfall. The longer they wait, the more the raft gains speed. So the outcome no longer depends only on their willingness to cooperate in order to navigate the raft to safety. It also hinges on their ability to do so in the midst of natural forces that are increasingly difficult to control and overcome. The message is clear. The current crisis might indeed eventually break eurozone leaders’ inherent resistance to compromise, collaboration, and common action. But the longer they bicker and dither, the greater the risk that what they gain in willingness will be lost to incapacity.",
            "欧洲非不为，乃不能乎？ 纽波特海滩—在描述欧洲不断恶化的危机时，可谓遍地隐喻。 一些人说，太晚了；另一些人说，欧洲就像是开足了马力驶向悬崖的汽车。 所有人都说，生死存亡的时刻越来越近了。 乐观派 — — 幸运的是，这类人依然存在，特别是在欧洲存在 — — 认为当临界时刻真的来临时，政治领导人会力挽狂澜，把欧洲带回经济增长、就业创造和金融稳定的正规上来。 但悲观派的人数和影响力正在与日俱增。 他们看到，在金融动荡之外，政治瘫痪正在发生，这扩大了欧元区原始设计漏洞。 当然，谁最终会被证明是正确的取决于欧元区各国政府是否愿意及时、合作地做出必须的决策。 但这并非唯一的决定因素：在“为”的意愿成为现实时，政府还必须“能”力挽狂澜。 而正是在这方面，没完没了的延迟让挑战越来越令人畏惧，也让结果越来越不确定。 有经验的观察家提醒我们，危机，而不是愿景，更能在欧洲历史性一体化的关节阶段推动进步。 欧洲一体化是一个几十年的历程，其背后的推动力是对确保在这个曾经是全世界最暴力地区、饱受可怕人道灾难摧残的地区实现长期和平与繁荣的渴望。 毕竟，欧盟（包括由17个成员国组成的欧元区）仍只是国家的组合，各国在经济、金融和社会条件诸方面存在巨大差异。 文化差异也持久存在着。 政治周期也远称不上同步。 而太多的地区治理机制（欧洲央行是一个显著的例外）缺乏足够的影响力和信誉，从而效率低下。 若任其自身自灭的话，这样一种组合极易因反复争吵、破坏性故作姿态以及在未来愿景问题上的分歧而深受伤害。 结果，在好光景时，通往真正经济和政治一体化之路困难又缓慢。 但若危机降临，所有这些都可以发生快速变化，特别是当危机威胁到欧洲工程的完整性时。 而欧元区如今就处于这样一个时刻。 欧元区外围国希腊所爆发的债务危机复仇般地朝核心国蔓延，以至于威胁到欧元区自身的生存。 政策反应月缓慢，关于欧洲未来的质疑声就越多。 维持17国组成的货币联盟已不再是理所当然之事。 让一些国家退出的声音 — — 首先是希腊，称为“希腊退出 ” — —现在已相当普遍。 只有最顽固不化的理想主义者才会对日渐增加的欧元区总体瓦解危险视而不见。 尽管如此，许多经验丰富的欧洲一体化工程实验者还是在围绕他们的心血的阴云中看到了一丝曙光。 对他们来说，唯有危机才能让政客们停止得过且过的幻想，刺激政策出台，在货币联盟之上加以银行联盟和政治联盟，确保欧元区能有一个稳定而可持续的四脚平台。 但这一观点���不是没有风险的。 它包含一个假设，当事情演变为千钧一发时，政治领导人真会去应该做的事情 — — 这是“为”的问题。 它还包含另一个假设，政治领导人有能力做这些事 — — 这是“能”的问题。 而随着时间的推移，后一个问题上的不确定性已上升到了令人不安的水平。 眼下，欧元区正深陷前所未有的不合作态度的重围，越来越多的国家的国民在经济、金融、政治和社会领域无法达成一致。 这一状况持续得越久，政客就越难控制国家命运，欧洲这一集体的未来也就越悬。 私人部门活动正在放缓，在欧元区最疲软经济体（希腊，那里正在爆发全面银行挤兑）更是接近停滞。 在其他地方，存款人也在开始将储蓄转移到欧元区内最坚挺经济体（德国）和区外安全港（瑞士和美国 ） 。 疲软公司正在裁员，坚挺公司则推迟了厂房和设备投资。 全球投资者继续蜂拥逃离欧元区，各国负债不断地被转移给纳税人和欧洲央行。 毫无疑问，越来越多的国家已经出现显而易见的社会动荡迹象。 毫无疑问，边缘政治运动正在整个欧元区赢得动力。 毫无疑问，近三分之二欧元区国家的选民在最近的选举中抛弃了现任政府。 所有这些都削弱了政府政策的效率 — — 损害了政策的信誉、堵住了政策向经济的传播渠道、增加了抵消私人部门资本和支出减少的难度。 结果，在欧洲处于绝对优势地位、不久前仍是欧洲主要优势之所在的市场经济和金融体系正在丧失活力。 我对隐喻也感兴趣。 上周，我对欧洲大陆进行了访问，期间我听说了一个能够很好地抓住当今欧洲动态关键点的隐喻。 欧元区领导人正身处一艘救生筏上。 这艘救生筏正在驶向致命瀑布。 欧元区领导人等得越久，救生筏的速度就越快。 因此，结果不仅取决于他们愿不愿意合作以改变救生筏方向驶向安全，也取决于他们能不能做到这一点 — — 他们所处的自然环境意味着控制和赢得胜利的难度正变得越来越大。 形势十分明朗。 当前的危机或许确实能够在最终打破欧元区领导人对妥协、合作、采取共同行动的天生抵制。 但他们争吵和犹豫的时间越长，他们在“为”方面所取得的进展因“能”方面的欠缺而沦为于事无补的风险就越大。"

            "Will Europe Learn to Love Bush? President George W. Bush will soon travel to Europe, and President Jacques Chirac will visit Washington. EU “Foreign Minister” Javier Solana has already been there, and returned bullish on future transatlantic cooperation. Atmospherically, at least, relations have, indeed, improved since the US presidential election, and both sides have expressed good will. Yet there is little ground for genuine optimism. Bush’s declared intention to “better explain the reasons for his decisions” to America’s Allies simply will not do. Europeans don’t want explanations; they want to be consulted – to have input into American decision-making and see their concerns reflected in US foreign policy. None of this is likely to happen. On the contrary, the US is continuing to thwart European efforts gradually to establish a rule-based international order. There are no signs that the Bush administration is relenting on, for example, the UN, the Kyoto Protocol, the International Criminal Court, the ban on land mines, or the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. In Iraq, Europeans fully share the American objectives of preserving the country’s unity and achieving at least some modicum of democracy. At the same time, they believe that it is up to the US to remove the chaos it created, so they are reluctant to contribute to the task in a substantive way. European attitudes may seem shortsighted to Americans, but it would need a lot of cajoling to change them. There is general agreement on the aims to be achieved in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict: the end of violence and a peaceful solution based on the concept of two sovereign states. However, Europeans consider the opinion recently expressed by Bush – that Palestinian democracy and not Israeli occupation of the West Bank is at the core of the problem – to be ill conceived. The same is true with respect to the President’s assertion that Israel’s permanent presence in Palestinian territories and the non-return of Palestinian refugees to their homes in Israel must be accepted as realities on the ground. It may well be that such painful deviations from agreed principles will be reflected in an eventual comprehensive settlement, but prejudging these issues before the beginning of negotiations denies the Palestinians some of their most important bargaining chips. On the question of Iran’s nuclear weapons capability, Americans and Europeans also fundamentally agree: it should be prevented. While the US tries to achieve this through hard power, regime change, sanctions, and threats of pre-emptive military intervention, Europe uses soft power, diplomacy, inclusion, and partnership. Unfortunately, this “good cop, bad cop” game doesn’t work in international politics. European efforts to induce Teheran to renounce its nuclear designs by addressing Iran’s legitimate security concerns and offering important opportunities for economic and social betterment cannot be successful without active US support. In other words, Europe’s carrots are not enough; a successful outcome requires American carrots, too. By standing aside and discounting the European approach from the outset, America is merely helping to bring about a self-fulfilling prophecy. It would be more productive for the US to join in, at the same time agreeing with Europeans on measures to be taken should their combined efforts fail. Relations with China have improved over the years on both sides of the Atlantic. China has become Europe’s biggest trading partner, and its huge reserves of US dollars has made it America’s most important creditor. Despite this rosy picture, China could be the cause of a major transatlantic row if Europeans make good on their intention to lift the arms export embargo in place since the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989. The Bush administration is fiercely opposed to lifting the embargo, pointing out that in the event of a military clash over Taiwan, US troops would face weapons provided to China by America’s own allies. In fact, European assurances that arms sales to China could be controlled and threats to an ally avoided do appear unconvincing. On the other hand, economic interdependence between Taiwan and mainland China has grown to such an extent that an armed conflict is increasingly unlikely. Of course, this would change were Taiwan to push for independence, but it would hardly do so without a nod from Washington. In short, on many of the most important current international issues, Americans and Europeans share the same objectives and basic goals. Where they often diverge is in the means to achieve them. Political wisdom would demand that the two sides pool their considerable resources and march together whenever possible. This, however, requires a change of attitudes both in America and in Europe. Bush must be willing to accept Europeans as genuine partners and stop treating them like recalcitrant vassals. European leaders must overcome any latent Anti-Americanism and be prepared to make the kind of contributions to common endeavors that would entitle them to equal partnership with the US.",
            "欧洲会开始喜欢布什吗？ 布什总统即将展开欧洲之行，而希拉克总统也即将访问华盛顿。 欧盟的“外交部长” 贾维尔·索拉纳已先期到过华府，归来后对跨大西洋合作的未来豪情万丈。 从气氛上看，至少欧美之间的关系自美国总统大选之后确实有所改善，且双方都表示过良好的意愿。 然而，这还不足以让我们对此感到真正的乐观。 布什所宣称的向其盟国“更好地解释他的决策理由”的意图不会奏效。 欧洲人不想听解释；他们想要协商—影响美国的决策并看到他们所关注的问题从美国的外交政策中反映出来。 而这样的情况似乎不会发生。 相反，美国正继续阻碍欧洲的努力以求建立一种以统治为基础的国际秩序。 布什政府对例如联合国 、 《 京都议定书 》 、 国际刑事法院、禁止地雷或反弹道导弹公约等事务方面也没有态度缓和的迹象。 在伊拉克，欧洲人完全支持美国维护该国统一和至少实现一定程度民主的目标。 同时，他们认为美国应该为其造成的混乱负责，所以不愿为实现这一目标做出实质性的贡献。 在美国人看来，欧洲的态度未免有点鼠目寸光，但要使欧洲人改变这一点需要美国付出相当的努力。 欧美在解决巴以冲突要达成的目标方面也有共识：终止暴力和一个以两个主权国家的理念为基础的和平解决方案。 然而，欧洲人认为布什最近发表的关于巴勒斯坦的民主而非以色列对约旦河西岸的占领才是问题核心的言论有失妥当。 同样欠妥的，还有布什关于必须接受以色列在巴领土上的永久性存在和不允许巴勒斯坦难民重返其以色列家园这些既成事实的言论。 这种对公认原则的严重背离最终很可能以混合的聚居点的形式反映出来，但在谈判还未开始之前就给这些问题盖棺定论实际上就剥夺了巴勒斯坦方面一些最重要的谈判筹码。 在伊朗制造核武的能力问题上，欧美双方的根本立场是一致的：应该防止。 当美国试图通过硬权力、改变政权、制裁和以先发制人的武装干涉相威胁来达到其目的时，欧洲却采用了软权力、外交、接触和伙伴关系的策略。 不幸的是，这种“好警察，坏警察”的游戏在国际政治中却是行不通的。 欧洲致力于通过正视伊朗合法的安全考虑和为其提供经济及社会发展的重要机会来促使德黑兰断绝设计核武的意图。 但这种努力没有美国的支持就不能成功。 换言之，欧洲的胡萝卜是不够的；要取得成功还需要美国的怀柔。 美国从一开始就对欧洲的努力漠不关心，因此其作用充其量也只是帮助促成了一个自我实现的预言。 更有成效的做法是美国应该参与进来，同时与欧洲就共同努力失败后所应采取的行动达成一致意见。 大西洋两岸与中国的关系随着时间的推移都有所改善。 中国已经成为欧洲最大的贸易伙伴，其巨额的美元储备使之成为美国最重要的债权国。 尽管前景光明，但如果欧洲真的实践解除其自1989年天安门事件以来就对中国实施的武器禁运的意图，那么中国就可能成为欧美之间发生争执的重要原因。 布什政府强烈反对解除禁运，并以一旦台海发生武装冲突，美国军队可能会面对自己的盟国卖给中国的武器为理由。 事实上，欧洲在对华军售在掌控之中和对盟国的威胁可以被避免方面的保证确实不令人信服。 另一方面，中国大陆和台湾之间的经济依存度已经变得如此之高，从而使武装冲突的几率进一步降低。 当然，如果台湾坚持要独立，形势可能会发生改变，但没有华盛顿的默许台湾也不大可能如此行事。 简而言之，欧美在当前许多最重要的国际问题方面有着共同的目标和基本立场。 双方出现分歧的地方往往是在达成目的的手段方面。 政治��慧要求欧美双方整合其可观的资源，并尽可能步调一致地行动。 但这需要欧美双方都改变态度。 布什必须愿意接纳欧洲人作为其真正的伙伴，而不是顽抗的附庸。 欧洲的领导者们必须克服一切潜在的反美国主义情绪，并准备为实现与美国真正的伙伴关系做出应有的贡献。"

            "Will Europe’s Fiscal Compact Work? CAMBRIDGE – At the start of 2013, the eurozone’s “fiscal compact” entered into force, owing to its ratification on December 21 by a 12th country, Finland, a year after German Chancellor Angela Merkel prodded eurozone leaders into agreement. The compact – technically called the Treaty on Stability, Coordination, and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union – requires member countries to introduce laws limiting their structural government budget deficits to less than 0.5 % of GDP (or less than 1% of GDP if their debt/GDP ratio is “significantly below 60%”). So, will this new approach work? A limit on the “structural deficit” means that a country can run a deficit above the limit to the extent – and only to the extent – that the gap between revenue and spending is cyclical (that is, its economy is operating below potential due to temporary negative shocks). In other words, the target is cyclically adjusted. The budget-balance rule must be adopted in each country – preferably enshrined in their national constitutions – by the end of 2013. The aim is to fix Europe’s long-term fiscal problem, which has been exacerbated by three factors: the failure, since the euro’s inception, of the eurozone-wide Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) to enforce deficit and debt limits; the crisis that erupted in Greece and other countries on the eurozone periphery in 2010; and the various bailouts that have followed. There is no reason to doubt that the member states will follow through and adopt national rules by the end of the year. The problem is what comes after that: the risk that the fiscal compact will founder on precisely the same shoals as the SGP. Ever since the eurozone was established, its members have issued official fiscal forecasts that are systematically biased in the optimistic direction. Other countries do this, too, but the bias among eurozone countries is, if anything, even worse than it is elsewhere. During an economic expansion, such as in the 2002-2007 period, governments are tempted to forecast that the boom will continue indefinitely. Forecasts for tax revenue and budget surpluses are correspondingly optimistic and so hide the need for fiscal adjustment. During a recession, such as in 2008-2012, governments are tempted to forecast that their economies and budgets will soon rebound. Since forecasting is subject to so much genuine uncertainty, no one can prove that the forecasts are biased when they are made. But, if forecasts are biased, fiscal rules will not constrain budget deficits. In any given year, governments can forecast that their growth rates, tax revenues, and budget balances will improve in subsequent years, and then argue the following year that the shortfalls were unexpected. Indeed, in a new paper, co-authored with Jesse Schreger, we show that eurozone members’ bias in official forecasts can be neatly characterized as responding to the SGP’s 3%-of-GDP limit on budget deficits in 1999-2011: each time governments exceeded the limit, over-optimistic forecasts followed. In other words, governments adjust their forecasts, not their policies. Framing the budget rules in cyclical terms, while highly desirable in terms of its macroeconomic impact, does not help to solve the problem of forecast bias. In fact, it can make the problem worse. In a year when a forecast for the structural budget deficit turns out to have been over-optimistic, the government can still claim that its own calculations show the shortfall to have been cyclical rather than structural. After all, estimation of potential output – and hence the cyclical versus structural decomposition of the fiscal position – is notoriously difficult, even after the fact. Perhaps it will help that, under the fiscal compact, the rules are to be adopted at the national level, as opposed to the SGP, which operated on the supranational level. A look at the various rules and institutions that European countries have already tried shows that some work and others do not. Creating an independent fiscal institution that provides its own budget forecasts works, insofar as it reduces the bias in deficit projections. When forecasting while in violation of the eurozone’s Excessive Deficit Procedure, eurozone members with an independent budget-forecasting institution have a mean bias that is 2.7% of GDP smaller at the one-year horizon than members without such an institution. It would be better still if governments were legally bound to use these independent forecasts in their budget plans (borrowing an innovation from Chile). But, regardless of how well designed the rules are, clever and determined politicians can find ways around them. One trick is privatization of government enterprises, which reduces the budget deficit in a given year on a one-time basis, but might increase the deficit in the long run if the enterprise had been profitable. Another trick is to legislate tax cuts that are “temporary,” in order to make future revenues look larger, despite the intention to make the cuts permanent before they expire. Other things being equal, the right institutions can curbpro-cyclical fiscal policies – tax cuts and spending hikes during booms and austerity during downturns – in the short run, while helping to deliver debt sustainability in the long run. These institutions include independent fiscal-forecasting agencies, combined with the cyclically adjusted budget targets that the eurozone’s fiscal compact mandates. Much can go wrong even if such mechanisms are in place; but, as the history of the SGP illustrates, the risk is higher if they are not.",
            "欧洲财政契约有用吗？ 发自剑桥 — — 在德国总理安吉拉·默克尔（Angela Merkel）敦促欧元区各国领导人达成协议的一年之后，2012年12月21日 ， “ 财政契约”得到了欧元区第12个国家芬兰的批准，由此从2013年起，欧元区“财政契约”开始生效。 这份全称为《欧洲经济货币联盟稳定、协调与治理公约》的文件要求成员国制定法律限制政府结构性预算赤字不得高于GDP的0.5 % （ 如果该国的债务对GDP比率“显著低于60 % ” ，则为1 % ） 。 那么这一新措施能起到作用吗？ 对“结构性赤字”的限制意味着成员国可以 — — 也只可以 — — 在收入与支出之间的差距是周期性的范围内最大程度地存在财政赤字，所谓周期性是指一国经济在暂时的负面冲击下在低于其潜能的水平上运行。 换句话说，所设立目标是可以随周期性调整的。 在2013年结束之前，每个成员国都必须将预算平衡内容添加到其法律体系中 — — 最好是加入到本国宪法体系之中。 此举的目的是为了解决欧洲的长期财政问题，且该财政问题已在以下三个因素的作用下加速恶化：自欧元诞生后覆盖欧元区的《稳定与增长公约》已经无法有效实施赤字与债务限制；2010年在希腊和一些欧元区外围国家爆发的经济危机；以及随后的各种救助行动。 毫无疑问，在年底之前各成员国都会跟进并颁布实施相关国家规定。 而问题在于随后发生的事情：财政契约的失败风险其实和《稳定与增长公约》是同样大的。 自从欧元区建立以来，其成员国发布了一系列普遍偏向乐观的官方财政预测。 当然其他国家也会如此，但如果说欧元区国家的预测有什么不同的话，那就是这种偏向实在是太离谱了。 在经济扩张期间，比如2002到2007年，各国政府都倾向于预测经济繁荣会无限期持续下去。 税收收入和预算盈余的预测都相对乐观，因而掩盖了财政调整的必要。 在衰退期间，比如2008到2012年，各国政府都倾向于预测本国经济和预算都会很快回升。 由于预测会受到很多不确定性因素的影响，在做预测时也没人能够证明那些预测有失偏颇。 但由于预测有失偏颇，财政规定就不会对预算赤字进行限制。 在任何一年，政府都会预测本国增长率、税收收入及预算平衡将在未来几年有所上升，而在接下来的一年又会为自己辩护说那些不符合预期的差额是意外因素导致的。 确实，在笔者与杰西·施雷格（Jesse Schreger）合作撰写的新报告中，我们提出欧元区成员国在官方预测上的偏向性整齐划一地表现为对《稳定与增长公约》中1999-2011年财政赤字低于GDP3%条款的回应：每当政府预算赤字超过限制，就会出台过度乐观的预测。 换句话说，各国政府调整的是其预测，而非政策。 而周期性地调整财政限制制度尽管在其对宏观经济的影响方面非常有利，却无助于解决财政预测偏差的问题。 事实上，这只会让问题变得更严重。 对结构性预算赤字的预测被证明过度乐观的一年，政府依然可以声称其内部计算显示差额的出现是周期性而非结构性的。 毕竟对潜在产出的估算 — — 从而对财政状况进行周期性或是结构性的解读 — — 是出了名的困难，即便是在事实之后计算也是如此。 也许在财政契约实施的情况下，它会有助于这些规则在国家层面上被采纳，而不像《稳定与增长公约》在超国家的层面上运作。 纵观欧洲国家已经尝试过的各种规则和机制我们就会知道，有些能起作用，有些则不能。 创建一个能自行做出预算预测的独立财政机构是可行的，因为它减少了赤字预算的偏差。 当预测违反了欧元区的过度赤字程序机制时，拥有独立预算预测机构的欧元区成员国的一年期平均偏差比没有这类机构的成员国要小，且小于的幅度达到GDP的2.7 % 。 如果各国政府能立法要求在其预算计划中必须使用这些独立预测的话则更好（这是从智利借鉴来的创新 ） 。 但是，不管规则设计得多么巧妙，聪明而有决心的政治家都有办法绕过这些规则。 其中一个窍门就是把政府企业私有化，这就减少了某年的预算赤字 — — 当然只能使用一次，但如果这个企业是盈利的话这也许会增加政府的长期赤字。 另一个窍门就是立法实施“暂时”的减税，这会使未来的收入看起来更多 — — 尽管其意图是维持减税直到该法律失效为止。 在其他条件不变的情况下，好的机构可以在短期内遏制那些以周期性为幌子的财政政策 — — 经济繁荣时期减税并增加支出，经济低迷时期实施财政紧缩 — — 并在长期内有助于实现债务可持续性。 这些机构包括独立的财政预测机构，并与由欧元区财政契约授权的周期调整预算目标相结合。 虽然即使具备这样的机制也很可能出错；但正如《稳定与增长公约》的历史表明的那样，如果没有这样的机制，出错的风险将会更高。"

            "Will Ex-Mexicans Choose America’s Next President? Among the many surprises during the Republican Party presidential candidates’ debates a couple of weeks ago was the rekindled importance of immigration. After the failure of President George W. Bush’s and Senator Edward Kennedy’s comprehensive immigration reform effort last spring, most observers thought the matter would remain dormant until 2009, since even touching it was potentially fatal for Democrats and Republicans alike. But as Democrats discovered in other recent debates, and as Republicans realized with a little help from the CNN organizers, who skewed the questions toward issues they feel strongly about, immigration is an issue that just won’t go away. This is one reason why I wrote a short but – I hope – useful book on Mexican immigration to the United States, entitled Ex-Mex: From Migrants to Immigrants . Based on internal documents from the Mexican and US governments, countless interviews, and a survey of much of the existing literature on the subject, Ex-Mex seeks to fulfill three purposes. First, I wanted to provide a Mexican voice in the immigration debate. Mexicans make up more than half of the flow and stock – legal or not – of all immigrants in the US, but a point of view attempting to reflect their interests and aspirations has been largely absent from the American discussion. Of course, my book cannot be the Mexican stance. But an assessment from the vantage point of past, current, and future Mexican immigrants to the US is a necessary component of the American debate – all the more so when one recalls that immigration has, in fact, not generally been exclusively a domestic US policy question. The first American immigration agreement with another country was signed in 1907 – the so-called Gentleman’s Agreement with Japan, while the US and Mexico negotiated and administered the Bracero Program for more than twenty years, from 1942 thru 1964. And, of course, the US has had a standing immigration agreement since 1965 with a country most Americans would not imagine: Fidel Castro’s Cuba. Second, it is important to place the current, raging debate in historical context. The most important feature of that context is that the actual flow of Mexicans entering the US today is not much greater than the overall average figure for the Bracero Program period: around 400,000 per year. It is similarly important to understand the evolution of US legislation on immigration since the 1920’s, and the shifts and hypocrisy involved in the application of those laws. For example, the 1996 immigration reforms implemented by the Clinton administration, along with other, underlying structural trends, halted the traditional circular pattern whereby Mexicans came and went to the US every year. Instead, they began to settle in communities farther from the border, greatly increasing the stock of Mexicans in the US. Finally, the efforts of the Mexican and US governments since 2001 to reach an accommodation on the issue have not been well understood. Confidential papers from the Bush and Fox administrations show that talks went further than previously known. The US, and particularly then-Secretary of State Colin Powell, was willing, as stated in a unclassified memo addressed to Bush in late August 2001, to go to great lengths to reach an understanding with Mexico on the issue. Indeed, the substance of the negotiations was not much different from the content of the Bush-Kennedy “grand bargain” that was fashioned in 2007. The electoral numbers perhaps best explain the immigration equation’s importance in today’s presidential campaigns. In 2008, it is likely that Latinos will make up 9% to 10% of the electorate, the highest share ever. They will wield decisive importance in swing states like Colorado, New Mexico, Florida, and Nevada. Having made significant inroads among Hispanic voters in 2000 and 2004, thanks to Bush’s support for immigration reform, Republicans now can barely count on 20% of that total – mainly among Cuban-Americans – thanks to their strident anti-immigration stance. Thus, if the Democrats demonstrate a minimum of compassion, sensitivity, and realism, they can count on a 7% advantage in the popular vote. But doing so could cost Democrats dearly in old industrial states like Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Michigan, where the arrival of Mexican migrants, transformed into immigrants, has stoked passions. Since the Democrats’ victory will most likely depend on these states, the Democratic candidate who can square this circle, or the Republican who can break it, may well win the presidency.",
            "墨西哥移民是否选择美国的下任总统？ 几个星期前共和党总统侯选人辩论中出现的众多惊奇之一就是重新触及了移民的重要性。 去年秋天布什总统和肯尼迪参议员的全面移民改革失败以来，大多数观察家认为这一事情将会在2009年以前搁置起来，因为即使是触及此事也会对民主和共和两党是潜在致命的。 但是正如民主党人在最近的辩论中所发现的以及共和党人在有线电视新闻网组织者帮助下认识到的那样，移民问题是一个挥之不去的问题。 这些电视台组织者拼命对那些他们有强烈感觉的问题提出问题。 这就是为什么我写一本短小但是希望是有用的有关墨西哥人移民美国的书。 这本书的名字叫<<原墨西哥人：从移居者到移民>>。 这本书力图根据墨西哥和美国两国政府的内部文件、数不清的采访以及对这一问题现有的文献调查来达到三个目的。 第一，我想要在移民问题辩论中提出墨西哥的声音。 墨西哥人在美国的所有合法或非法移民移动和总量上占据一半以上，但是在美国人的辩论中却基本上一直没有试图反映墨西哥人利益以及渴求的观点。 当然，我的书并不能成为墨西哥的立场。 但是分析过去、现在以及将来墨西哥到美国的移民的观点却是美国人辩论的一个必要的组成部分。 实际上，如果人们记得移民一直并不是单纯的美国国内政策问题，这一点就更为如此了。 美国与外国签订的第一个移民协议是在1907年，也就是与日本签订的所谓君子协定。 从1942年到1964年，美国和墨西哥在二十多年的时间里谈判并执行了短工项目。 当然，美国自1965年以来与一个大多数美国人难以想像的国家即卡斯特罗统治下的古巴一直保持一项移民协议。 第二，把当前情绪化的辩论放置在历史的角度非常重要。 最为重要的特点就是今天实际进入美国的墨西哥人数量远远大于短工项目期间的总体平均数量，也就是每年40万人左右。 同样重要的是理解自二十世纪二十年代以来美国移民立法上的变迁以及在执行这些法律上的变化和伪善。 例如，由克林顿政府在1996年实行的移民改革与其他基本的结构性趋势一样停止了墨西哥人传统上每年往返美国的循环模式。 相反，他们开始远离边界社区，从而大幅度增加了美国的墨西哥人数量。 最后，人们还没有很好地理解墨西哥和美国两国政府自2001年以来试图达成移民问题的努力。 布什政府和福克斯政府的机密文件显示，会谈进行的要比原来知道的要深入。 根据2001年8月底向布什提交的一份解密的备忘录所称，美国政府特别是国务卿鲍威尔愿意尽力与墨西哥在这一问题上达成谅解。 实际上，谈判的实质内容与布什肯尼迪在2007年提出的“大赦”并没有多大区别。 选民数量可能最好解释当今总统竞选中移民问题的重要性。 在2008年，拉美族裔人口有可能占据选举人口的9%到10 % ， 这是有史以来最高的。 他们将会在科罗拉多、新墨西哥、佛罗里达以及内华达等摇摆不定的州发��决定性的作用。 由于布什支持移民改革，共和党在2000年和2004年在拉美选民中取得重大进步。 由于共和党人强硬的反移民立场，他们现在只能指望这一总数的20 % ， 主要是在古巴美国人中。 这样，如果民主党表现出最低程度的同情、敏感以及现实主义，那么他们就可以在全民投票中得到7%的优势。 但是这样做有可能在宾夕法尼亚、俄亥俄以及密西根等老的工业州让民主党付出代价。 在那些地方，墨西哥的移居者转变成为移民燃起了热情。 由于民主党的胜利最需要依靠这些州，那些能够在移民问题上获得成功的民主党人或者打破这一问题包围的共和党人就有可能赢得总统大选胜利。"

            "Economics in the New Age of National Security ABIDJAN – The global economy has entered a new age of national security. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the vulnerability caused by overreliance on global supply chains and the failure of coordination in tackling global health risks. But what has really ushered in this new era is Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine and sabotage of the global economy. Beyond its human and economic toll, the war in Ukraine has sharply increased the divisions between the Western and Eastern geopolitical blocs centered around the United States and China, respectively. Russia has weaponized its energy and food exports to divide Europeans and has sought to stoke anti-Western sentiment in developing countries. China has sided with Russia and affirmed its support for the Kremlin’s security concerns. Tensions over Taiwan, a leading global semiconductor manufacturer, are another major flash point in US-China relations. These developments should be seen as aftershocks of the world economy’s increasing polarization, underpinned by the asymmetry of the two superpowers’ political systems. It is no coincidence that several frozen conflicts have recently become active, and that many medium-size and regional powers are behaving more assertively. Unlike the Soviet Union during the Cold War, China is both a strategic and an economic rival to the US. China’s growing trade and financial ties with the Global South help to explain the shift in many poorer countries’ allegiances vis-à-vis America. But the decision by many developing countries in March to abstain from voting on United Nations General Assembly resolutions condemning Russia’s invasion of Ukraine surprised US and European officials. The growing geopolitical and economic split between the superpowers should prompt a paradigm shift in economic thinking. Economists have long regarded national security as a separate field of study with little relevance to their analysis of markets – and for good reason: their profession, like the global economy, has flourished amid the relative stability of the post-World War II era. The Bretton Woods institutions and the World Trade Organization – with the West and specifically the US providing an implicit backstop – have helped support the global economy’s expansion. Since 1960, global GDP has increased about eightfold. And as a result of the Chinese economy’s formidable rise in recent decades, China’s GDP (measured at market exchange rates) could surpass that of the US by 2030. But today’s geopolitical polarization risks fragmenting the global economy in multiple ways. There are strong indications that this is already happening. Former US President Donald Trump’s “America First” approach and instigation of a tariff war with China dealt a sharp blow to free markets and free trade, and Joe Biden’s administration has followed suit. US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen recently advocated “friend-shoring” supply chains to trusted allies as part of America’s strategic response to the growing Chinese challenge. But deciding who counts as a “friend” may be difficult; using criteria such as a country’s commitment to democracy could result in a rather small group. In parallel, a growing number of countries have shown interest in joining the BRICS, a group comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. China is promoting a new global governance system supported by new organizations. And China and Russia are looking to develop alternatives to the SWIFT payment system. That, too, will not be easy, not least because payment systems are intertwined with issues related to reserve currencies. A litmus test for China is whether it can find an alternative to US Treasuries in which to invest its sizeable foreign-exchange reserves. There have been many historical episodes of fragmentation, including trade wars, but perhaps none so pervasive between two economic and strategic superpowers. The trend is evident in stock-exchange delistings, sectors such as microchips and telecommunications technology, agricultural land sales, energy, and the defense industry. And the fragmentation of supply chains for both goods and services could increase further as a result of non-tariff barriers such as security, privacy, and phytosanitary standards or problems related to the interoperability of electronic and digital equipment. The trade-offs between economic efficiency and national security are enormous. Deviating from globalized markets will no doubt reduce efficiency, stoke inflation, and leave hundreds of millions of people worse off. Economists should therefore rethink their approach to topics such as comparative advantage, market integration, and how to promote convergence. In this new environment where security of supply has become paramount, the design of value chains will have to minimize the risk of weaponization. And while free markets define efficient pricing better than any other mechanism, fragments of the global economy will likely function independently with autonomous pricing and sourcing. Tackling increasing economic fragmentation and curbing its costs will undoubtedly require economists to address the underlying sources of division. Building trust and limiting uncertainty between the two superpowers and their allies will thus be vital.",
            "新国家安全时代的经济 发自阿比让 — — 全球经济已经进入了一个国家安全的新时代。 新冠疫情凸显了过度依赖全球供应链和无法协调应对全球健康风险所导致的脆弱性。 但真正揭幕这个新时代的是俄罗斯对乌克兰的无端入侵及其对全球经济的蓄意破坏。 除了人员和经济损失外，乌克兰战争还急剧加大了分别以美国和中国为中心的西方和东方地缘政治集团之间的分歧。 俄罗斯将其能源和粮食出口作为武器来分化欧洲并试图在发展中国家煽动反西方情绪。 而中国则与俄罗斯站在一起，公开申明支持克里姆林宫的安全关切。 同时围绕台湾这个全球领先半导体元件生产者的紧张局势也是美中关系的另一个主要爆点。 这些事态发展应被视为世界经济日益两极化的余震，背后则是两个超级大国政治制度的不对称状况。 无怪乎最近有几场早已平息的冲突死灰复燃，许多中型和区域性大国也表现得更加强硬。 与冷战时期的苏联不同，中国既是美国的战略对手也是经济对手。 虽然中国与其他发展中国家日益增长的贸易和金融关系有助于解释许多较贫穷国家对美忠诚度的转变，但许多发展中国家在3月对谴责俄罗斯入侵乌克兰的联合国大会决议投弃权票的决定依然让美国和欧洲官员大感意外。 超级大国之间日益加剧的地缘政治和经济分裂应促使经济思维范式发生转变。 长期以来经济学家都将国家安全视为一个跟市场分析无甚关联的独立研究领域。 他们这样做是完全有理由的，因为他们这一行和全球经济一样，都是在二战后的相对稳定中蓬勃发展起来的。 布雷顿森林体系和世界贸易组织 — — 在西方特别是美国的隐性支持下 — — 帮助支持了全球经济的扩张。 自1960年以来全球GDP增长了约8倍。 在中国经济近几十年来的大规模崛起之下，该国GDP（按市场汇率计算）有望在2030年超过美国。 但当今的地缘政治两极分化有可能以多种方式分裂全球经济，而且有明确迹象表明这种情况已经发生了。 美国前总统特朗普的“美国优先”做法和他挑起的中美关税战给自由市场和自由贸易带来了沉重打击，而拜登政府则在这方面亦步亦趋。 美国财政部长珍妮特·耶伦（Janet Yellen）最近主张将供应链“友岸外包”给值得信赖的盟友，以此作为对日益增长的中国挑战的战略回应的一部分。 但是对“朋友”的界定或许有点难度，倘若使用一个国家对民主的承诺这类标准的话可能导致友邦群体过小。 与此同时，越来越多的国家对加入由巴西、俄罗斯、印度、中国和南非组成的金砖国家集团表示出兴趣。 中国正在推动一个由新组织支持的新全球治理体系；还在与俄罗斯联手试图开发SWIFT支付系统的替代品 — — 后者并非易事，尤其是因为支付系统与储备货币的诸多相关问题交织在一起。 对中国来说一个试金石就是能否找到美国国债的替代品来投资其庞大的外汇储备。 历史上不乏各类分裂性事件，包括贸易战，但或许没有一个能跟当今两个经济和战略超级大国之间的斗争这样广泛。 这种趋势在证券交易所退市、微芯片和电信技术等行业、农业土地销售、能源和国防工业中都很明显。 同时由于安全、隐私和植物检疫标准等非关税壁垒或是电子和数字设备互操作性问题，商品和服务供应链的分裂可能进一步加剧。 经济效率和国家安全之间的权衡是影响巨大的。 偏离全球化的市场无疑会降低效率，激发通胀，拉低数亿人的生活水平。 因此经济学家应该重新思考他们对比较优势、市场一体化以及如何促进融合等议题的研究方法。 在这个供应安全变得至关重要的新环境中，价值链的设计必须尽量减少武器化风险。 虽然自由市场在定义有效定价方面优于其他一切机制，但全球经济的各个部分可能会独立运作，自主定价和采购。 应对日益严重的经济分裂并抑制其成本无疑需要经济学家去解决分裂的根本来源，因此在两个超级大国及其盟友之间建立信任和缩小不确定性将是至关重要的，但这将需要与现今经济思维完全不同的东西。"

            "Will Global Imbalances Return? BEIJING – Future history books, depending on where they are written, will take one of two approaches to assigning blame for the world’s current financial and economic crisis. One approach will blame lax regulation, accommodating monetary policy, and inadequate savings in the United States. The other, already being pushed by former and current US officials like Alan Greenspan and Ben Bernanke, will blame the immense pool of liquidity generated by high-savings countries in East Asia and the Middle East. All that liquidity, they will argue, had to go somewhere. Its logical destination was the country with the deepest financial markets, the US, where it raised asset prices to unsustainable heights. Note the one thing on which members of both camps agree: the global savings imbalance – low savings in the US and high savings in China and other emerging markets – played a key role in the crisis by allowing Americans to live beyond their means. It encouraged financiers desperate to earn a return on abundant funds to put them to more speculative use. If there is a consensus on one issue, it is the impossibility of understanding the bubble and the crash without considering the role of global imbalances. Preventing future crises similar to this one therefore requires resolving the problem of global imbalances. Here, the early signs are reassuring. American households are saving again. The US trade deficit has declined from $60 billion a month to just $26 billion, according to the most recent data. As a matter of simple arithmetic, we know that the rest of the world is running correspondingly smaller surpluses. But once American households rebuild their retirement accounts, they may return to their profligate ways. Indeed, the Obama administration and the Federal Reserve are doing all they can to pump up US spending. The only reason the US trade deficit is falling is that the country remains in a severe recession, causing US imports and exports to collapse in parallel. With recovery, both may recover to previous levels, and the 6%-of-GDP US external deficit will be back. In fact, there has been no change in relative prices or depreciation of the US dollar of a magnitude that would augur a permanent shift in trade and spending patterns. Whether there is a permanent reduction in global imbalances will depend mainly on decisions taken outside the US, specifically in countries like China. One’s forecast of those decisions hinges, in turn, on why these other countries came to run such large surpluses in the first place. One view is that their surpluses were a corollary of the policies favoring export-led growth that worked so well for so long. China’s leaders are understandably reluctant to abandon a tried-and-true model. They can’t restructure their economy instantaneously. They can’t move workers from painting children’s toys in Guangdong to building schools in Western China overnight. They need time to build a social safety net capable of encouraging Chinese households to reduce their precautionary saving. If this view is correct, we can expect to see global imbalances re-emerge once the recession is over and to unwind only slowly thereafter. The other view is that China contributed to global imbalances not through its merchandise exports, but through its capital exports. What China lacked was not demand for consumption goods, but a supply of high-quality financial assets. It found these in the US, mainly in the form Treasury and other government-backed securities, in turn pushing other investors into more speculative investments. Recent events have not enhanced the stature of the US as a supplier of high-quality assets. And China, for its part, will continue to develop its financial markets and its capacity to generate high-quality financial assets internally. But doing so will take time. Meanwhile, the US still has the most liquid financial markets in the world. This interpretation again implies the re-emergence of global imbalances once the recession ends, and their very gradual unwinding thereafter. One development that could change this forecast is if China comes to view investing in US financial assets as a money-losing proposition. US budget deficits as far as the eye can see might excite fear of losses on US Treasury bonds. A de facto policy of inflating away the debt might stoke such fears further. At that point, China would pull the plug, the dollar would crash, and the Fed would be forced to raise interest rates, plunging the US back into recession. There are two hopes for avoiding this disastrous outcome. One is relying on Chinese goodwill to stabilize the US and world economies. The other is for the Obama administration and the Fed to provide details about how they will eliminate the budget deficit and avoid inflation once the recession ends. The second option is clearly preferable. After all, it is always better to control one’s own fate.",
            "全球失衡会重现吗？ 北京－未来的历史书籍，由于写作地点的不同，会采用下述两种方式中的一种，来归咎当前世界金融和经济危机的责任。 历史书籍两种归责方式中的一种，会将当前的金融和经济危机归咎于美国松懈的监管、没有原则的货币政策以及储蓄不足；另一种 — — 像格林·斯潘和本·伯南克这样的前任美联储官员和现任美联储官员已经强调了这种方式，会将当前的金融和经济危机归咎于东亚和中东的高储蓄国家制造的巨大流动性。 他们认为，所有这些流动性都去了某个地方，其合理的目的地就是拥有最复杂的金融市场的美国，并且在进入美国之后将美国的资产价格抬升到了无法持续的高度。 请注意，上述两个阵营的人对这个观点达成了共识：即全球储蓄失衡 — — 美国的低储蓄和中国及其他新兴市场的高储蓄 — — 使美国人过上一种本身无法承受的生活，这对经济危机的发生起到了关键作用。 这种全球储蓄失衡，促使金融家为了获得收益，不顾一切地将大量资金投入到越来越具有投机性的用途中去。 如果说人们已经在某个问题上达成了共识的话，这个问题就是，如果不考虑全球失衡的作用，要想理解资产泡沫和经济危机是不可能的。 因此，要预防将来发生类似的经济危机，我们就要解决全球失衡的问题。 在这里，事情发展的初步迹象是令人欣慰的。 美国家庭再次开始储蓄了。 根据最新的数据，美国的贸易逆差已经从每月600亿美元下降到每月只有260亿美元了。 只要我们进行一个简单的算术运算，就知道世界其他地区的贸易顺差相应地减少了。 但是，一旦美国家庭重新充实了他们的退休账户，他们就有可能回到挥霍的老路上去。 事实上，奥巴马政府和美联储都在竭尽所能地提振美国消费。 美国贸易逆差减少的唯一原因是美国仍然处在严重的衰退之中，而衰退又导致美国的出口和进口同时减少。 随着经济的复苏，美国的出口和进口都有可能恢复到以前的水平，占美国GDP6％的国际收支赤字会再次出现。 事实上，美元相对价格的变化，或者是美元的贬值，都没有达到足以预示国际贸易和消费模式会发生永久性转变的程度。 全球失衡是否会有永久性的减少主要取决于美国之外的国家的决策，具体来说，就是像中国这样的国家的决策。 反过来，人们要预测这些国家会作出什么决策，其关键在于首先要知道，这些国家为什么要保持这么巨额的贸易顺差。 一种观点认为，这些��家的顺差是长期以来运行良好的鼓励以出口为导向的经济增长模式的政策的必然结果。 中国的领导人不愿意放弃一个经过检验的模式，是可以理解的。 他们不能瞬间改变中国的经济结构。 他们也无法在一夜之间，将在广东给儿童玩具上色的工人转移到中国西部建造学校。 他们需要时间来建立一个能够鼓励中国家庭减少预防性储蓄的社会保障网络。 如果这种观点是正确的，我们就可以预期，一旦经济衰退结束，我们又会看到全球失衡再次出现，而且此后只能慢慢调整这种失衡。 另一种观点认为，中国不是通过其商品出口造成了全球失衡，而是通过其资本输出造成了全球失衡。 中国缺乏的不是对消费品的需求，而是对高质量的金融资产的供应。 中国在美国找到了自己缺乏的高质量的金融资产 — — 这些金融资产主要表现为美国国债和其他政府证券，而这又促使其他投资者进行更为投机的投资活动。 最近的经济危机并没有提升美国作为高质量的金融资产提供者的形象。 而在中国方面，中国会继续发展其金融市场以及提供高质量的国内金融资产的能力。 但是，中国要实现这一点需要时间，同时，美国仍然拥有世界上流动性最好的金融市场。 这样的阐释再次暗含着，一旦经济衰退结束，全球失衡就会重现，在此之后对其的调整也很漫长。 有一种变化能够改变这种预期，即中国认为投资美国金融资产是一个赔钱的买卖。 就目前而言，美国的预算赤字可能会引起中国对投资美国国债亏损的担忧。 美国事实上的通过通货膨胀抵消债务的政策，会进一步强化中国的这种恐惧。 届时，中国就会撤出投资，美元就会崩溃，美联储就可能被迫提高利率，进而使美国经济再次陷入衰退。 对避免这种灾难性的后果，存在两个希望。 一个希望是希望中国具有稳定美国和世界经济的善意，另一个是希望奥巴马政府和美联储提供有关一旦经济衰退结束，他们会怎样消除预算赤字并避免通货膨胀的详情。 显然，第二种选择更可取。 毕竟，掌握自己的命运总是比依靠别人要好。"

            "Will Governmental Folly Now Allow for a Cyber Crisis? CAMBRIDGE – When the financial crisis of 2008 hit, many shocked critics asked why markets, regulators, and financial experts failed to see it coming. Today, one might ask the same question about the global economy’s vulnerability to cyber-attack. Indeed, the parallels between financial crises and the threat of cyber meltdowns are striking. Although the greatest cyber threat comes from rogue states with the capacity to develop extremely sophisticated computer viruses, risks can also come from anarchistic hackers and terrorists, or even from computer glitches compounded by natural catastrophe. A few security experts have voiced great alarm, including, most recently, Jonathan Evans, the head of the British Security Service (MI5). By and large, however, few leaders are willing to compromise growth in the tech sector or the Internet in any significant way in the name of a threat that is so amorphous. Instead, they prefer to establish relatively innocuous working groups and task forces. It is difficult to overstate the dependence of modern economies on large-scale computer systems. But imagine if one day a host of key communications satellites were incapacitated, or the databases of major financial systems were erased. Experts have long identified the electricity grid as the most acute vulnerability, since any modern economy would collapse without power. True, many skeptics argue that with reasonable low-cost prophylactic measures, large scale cyber-meltdowns are highly implausible, and that doom-mongers overstate the worst-case scenarios. They say that the ability of cyber-terrorists and blackmailers to take the global economy to the brink, as in the 2007 Bruce Willis movie Die Hard 4, is utterly fictional. It is difficult to judge who is right, and there are important experts on both sides of the debate. But there do seem to be an uncomfortable number of similarities between the political economy of cyberspace regulation and of financial regulation. First, both cyber-security and financial stability are extremely complex topics with which government regulators can hardly keep up. Industry remuneration for experts is far in excess of any public-sector salary, and the best minds are continually bid away. As a result, some argue that the only solution is reliance on self-regulation by the software industry. One hears this argument for many modern industries, from big food to big pharma to big finance. Second, like the financial sector, the tech industry is enormously influential politically through contributions and lobbying. In the United States, all presidential candidates must make pilgrimages to Silicon Valley and other tech centers to raise money. Excessive financial-sector influence was, of course, a root cause of the 2008 meltdown and remains deeply implicated in today’s continuing eurozone mess. Third, with slowing growth in advanced economies, information technology seems to hold the moral high ground, just as finance did until five years ago. And crude attempts by governments to enforce regulation are likely to prove ineffective in protecting against catastrophe, while all too effective in strangling growth. In both cases – financial stability and cyber security – the risk of contagion creates a situation in which a wedge can form between private incentives and social risks. Admittedly, progress in the technology sector overall often produces huge social-welfare gains, which arguably outstrip those produced by all other sectors in recent decades. But, just as with nuclear power plants, progress can go awry in the absence of good regulation. Finally, the greatest risks come from arrogance and ignorance, two human characteristics at the heart of most financial crises. Recent revelations about the super-viruses “Stuxnet” and “Flame” are particularly disconcerting. These viruses, apparently developed by the US and Israel to disrupt Iran’s nuclear program, embody a level of sophistication far beyond anything previously seen. Both are deeply encrypted and difficult to detect once inside a computer. The Flame virus has the capacity to take over a computer’s peripherals, record Skype conversations, take pictures through a computer’s camera, and transmit information via Bluetooth to any nearby device. If the world’s most sophisticated governments are developing computer viruses, what guarantee is there that something won’t go awry? How can we be sure that they won’t “escape” and infect a much broader class of systems, or be adopted for other uses, or that future rogue states or terrorists won’t find a way to turn them on their creators? No economy is more vulnerable than the US, and it is arrogance to believe that US cyber superiority (to all except perhaps China) provides it with impenetrable security from attack. Unfortunately the solution is not so simple as just building better anti-virus programs. Virus protection and virus development constitute an uneven arms race. A virus can be just a couple hundred lines of computer code, compared to hundreds of thousands of lines for anti-virus programs, which must be designed to detect wide classes of enemies. We are told not to worry about large-scale cyber meltdowns, because none has occurred, and governments are being vigilant. Unfortunately, another lesson of the financial crisis is that most politicians are congenitally incapable of making difficult choices until risks actually materialize. Let us hope that we are lucky for a while longer.",
            "政府的愚蠢能否立即导致一场网络危机？ 剑桥 — — 2008年金融危机来袭时，很多大吃一惊的批评家们质问为什么市场、监管机构和金融专家未能预见到这场危机。 今天，人们或许会对全球经济面对网络攻击时的脆弱性提出同样的问题。 其实，金融危机和网络崩溃这两种威胁之间惊人的相似。 虽然最大的网络威胁来源于有能力研发复杂计算机病毒的流氓国家，但风险也同样来自于信奉无政府主义的黑客和恐怖分子，甚至可能来自于因自然灾害而加剧的电脑故障。 不止一位安全专家都发出了严正警告，包括不久前英国安全局（军情五处）的负责人乔纳森·埃文斯。 但总的来讲，很少有领导人愿意因为这样一种难以名状的威胁而明显放缓科技领域或互联网的发展速度。 反之，他们更愿意组建相对无伤大雅的特遣队和工作组。 人类几乎不可能夸大现代经济对大型计算机系统的依赖程度。 但想象一下如果哪天某台管理关键通信卫星的主机瘫痪无法工作，或者主要金融系统中的数据库遭到删除。 电网早就被专家认定为最严重的漏洞，因为一旦供电被切断，任何现代经济都会陷入崩溃。 当然，很多怀疑论者提出只要采取低成本的合理预防措施，大规模网络崩溃的可能性非常之低，末日论者夸大了可能出现最坏情况。 他们表示网络恐怖分子和恐吓勒索者再现2007年布鲁斯·威利斯电影《虎胆龙威4》中的恐怖一幕，将全球经济推向崩溃边缘的能力完全是虚构的。 辩论的正反两方都有重量级的专家，很难判断哪一方的观点更加贴近事实。 但是，网络空间监管和金融监管的政治经济之间的确存在着令人不安的相似之处。 首先，网络安全和金融稳定都是极为复杂的课题，政府监管部门想要完全跟上它们的发展有些力不从心。 从业专家的报酬远远超过任何公共部门的工资，而顶尖的人才不断地被吸引过去。 因此有人认为，唯一的办法是依赖软件业的自我调节机制。 人们在许多现代工业中都��听到这种说法，从大型食品到大型制药再到大型金融公司。 其次，像金融业一样，高科技行业通过捐款和游说拥有了巨大的政治影响力。 美国的所有总统候选人必须到硅谷和其他高科技中心去朝圣筹资。 金融部门影响过大无疑是2008年危机的根本原因，而且在今天的欧元区乱象中仍然脱不了干系。 第三，随着先进经济体增长放缓，就像五年前的金融业那样，道德的制高点似乎被信息业所占据。 事实证明政府执行监管的粗暴尝试可能无法防止灾难的发生，但在扼杀经济增长方面却收效显著。 在金融稳定和网络安全两大课题下，蔓延的危险造成了私人激励和社会风险机制的分离。 诚然，技术领域的总体进展往往能产生巨大的社会福利效益，这种效益甚至可能超过近几十年来所有其他行业的总和。 但正如核电厂一样，缺乏良好的监管可能导致在进展的过程中出现差错。 最后，最大的风险来自于傲慢和无知，这两种人性的弱点一直处在多数金融危机的核心位置。 最近关于超级病毒Stuxnet和火焰（Flame）的披露尤其令人不安。 这些病毒似乎由美国和以色列研发用于破坏伊朗的核计划，体现出远超之前记录的先进水平。 这两种病毒均经过深度加密，一旦输入计算机就很难被发现。 火焰病毒能够接管计算机的外围设备、Skype通话记录、借助电脑摄像头拍照，并通过蓝牙设备向任何邻近设备传输信息。 如果世界上最先进的政府都在研制计算机病毒，那么还有什么能够保证不会出现差错？ 我们怎能肯定它们不会“泄露”并感染更大范围的系统，或者被转作其他用途，再或者未来的无赖国家或恐怖分子不会利用它们反过来攻击它们的创造者？ 没有哪国经济比美国更加脆弱，认为美国（对除中国之外所有国家）的网络优势在攻击面前坚不可摧仅仅是傲慢而已。 不幸的是，解决办法不是编写更好的防病毒程序那么简单。 病毒防护和病毒开发构成了一场不平衡的军备竞赛。 病毒可能仅仅是几百行计算机代码，但防毒程序的长度却至少成千上万，因为防毒程序的设计必须能够发现各式各样的敌人。 我们被告知不用担心大规模的网络崩溃，因为政府会时刻保持警惕，而且这样的网络崩溃还从未发生过。 不幸的是金融危机的另一个教训是，多数政客命中注定无法在风险实际兑现前作出艰难的抉择。 我们只能希望能够幸运更长一段时间。"

            "Will Hamas Win the Peace? WASHINGTON, DC –For generations to come, the Palestinians will remember the horrific war in Gaza with pain and bitterness. But what cannot yet be seen is how Palestinians will view Hamas. Whether Hamas can claim a victory – and whether Palestinians will believe them will be determined by the type of ceasefire that is eventually agreed, if a formal one is eventually agreed. The end game – for both Israel and Hamas – is thus crucially important. For the moment, Hamas is perceived by the majority of Palestinians as the victim of a war intended to gain its surrender. After all, Hamas was democratically elected, but was forbidden from ruling and besieged in Gaza. At the same time, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas is accused of siding with Israel in order to restore his lost authority in Gaza. The war exposed flaws in Hamas’ judgment. Hamas apparently did not envision a full-scale confrontation with Israel when it refused to renew a six-month truce. With Gaza suffering under a lengthy siege, Hamas leader Khalid Mashal said that there was no point in a new truce, since the old one had “failed to lift the siege on Gaza.” Other leaders were quoted as saying that Hamas would “lift the siege by force.” If Hamas is to survive the war, it must demonstrate that its resistance resulted in a permanent opening of Gaza’s border crossings, especially in Rafah. For Palestinians, these are signs of victory. With open borders, Hamas would secure its regime in Gaza and build its popularity in the West Bank, putting enormous pressure on Abbas, the leader of the rival Fatah movement, to accept a national unity government on terms set by Hamas. Members of Fatah’s Central Committee are already accusing Abbas of supporting Israel in the fighting, of wanting to “return to Gaza on an Israeli tank.” Radical groups within Fatah are leaning toward an open alliance with Hamas. If Hamas comes out ahead, Abbas’s allies in other Palestinian factions will press him to accept Hamas and Islamic Jihad within the PLO. Egypt will have to backtrack on its rejection of Hamas in order to recover its image among the Arabs and to reduce tensions within Egyptian society. Pressure to integrate Hamas into Palestinian politics is also likely in some European capitals, particularly Paris and London, where some expressed opposition to isolating Hamas even before the war. But if Israel forces Hamas to accept its conditions for border controls and a formal ceasefire, Hamas’s image as the guardian of Palestinian resistance will be severely damaged. Palestinians will ask if it was really necessary to fight this war and pay such a high price. Abbas will be able to argue that he advised Hamas to renew the truce and to end its missile fire on Israeli towns, but that Hamas insisted on exposing Palestinian civilians to devastation. One indicator to watch for: the length of that ceasefire. Palestinians will recognize Hamas’s acceptance of a multi-year truce with Israel as a sign of defeat, which would also underscore Palestinian feelings of humiliation and abandonment. Hezbollah, despite its rhetoric, has taken no steps to support Hamas, and the Arab states seemed more than willing to support its defeat. It is in rebuilding Gaza that the stakes of the competition will increase. Abbas, supported by the United States and the European Union, may have control over significant funding. The test for him will be to deliver quickly. Hamas will also have resources for reconstruction. Qatar, a Hamas supporter, has already announced an investment fund for Gaza and contributed $250 million. Hamas will have to make a convincing case that Gaza’s near destruction is a price that had to be paid. Many Palestinians believe that Israel inflicted this damage on Gaza to drive a wedge between the people and the “resistance.” There is a precedent for this argument: Hezbollah described the destruction of Beirut’s southern suburbs in exactly these terms at the end of the Lebanon War in July 2006. More importantly, Hamas can demonstrate that its leaders have been on the front lines during this war, sharing Palestinian suffering; many have been killed, along with their families. The biggest question is whether the war will alter Hamas’ political goals. Two weeks ago, Musa Abu Marzouk, a senior Hamas official, praised Jimmy Carter in The Los Angeles Times as the only American president who had brought true peace in the Middle East. This is a radical departure from Hamas rhetoric, which has always portrayed the Camp David agreement between Israel and Egypt as a betrayal of the Islamic world. It remains to be seen whether Abu Marzouk’s view is merely a tactic intended to encourage the Obama administration to reach out to Hamas, or whether the war convinced Hamas that the two-state solution is the only viable option to settle the conflict with Israel.",
            "哈马斯会赢得和平吗？ 华盛顿特区－接下来的几代巴勒斯坦人都会充满痛苦地记住可怕的加沙战争。 但是，巴勒斯坦人会怎样看待哈马斯，仍然有待观察。 哈马斯是否能获胜，以及巴勒斯坦人是否信任他们要取决于最终达成的停火的种类 — — 如果最终达成了正式停火协议的话。 因此，对以色列和哈马斯来说，战争的结局都是至关重要的。 当前，大多数巴勒斯坦人将哈马斯看作是一场为了使哈马斯投降的战争的受害者。 毕竟，哈马斯是民主当选的，但是，却被禁止在加沙进行统治，而且还被包围。 同时，许多巴勒斯坦人指责巴勒斯坦民族权力机构主席穆罕默德·阿巴斯为了恢复其在加沙失去的威信，而支持以色列。 这次战争暴露了哈马斯判断的失误。 当哈马斯拒绝续订六个月的休战协定时，它显然没有预想到会和以色列进行全面的对抗。 在加沙遭到长时间的封锁时，哈马斯领导人卡里德·马舍尔（Khalid Mashal）声称，因为老停火协议“没能解除对加沙的封锁 ” ， 所以没有订立新停火协议的必要。 根据有人援引的哈马斯其他领导人的说法，哈马斯会“使用武力解除封锁 ” 。 如果哈马斯要在此次战争中幸存下来，它必须证明其抵抗在加沙边境地带，特别是在拉法（Rafah ） ， 形成了一个永久性的通路。 对巴勒斯坦人来说，这些都是成功的标志。 随着边境的开放，哈马斯会巩固其在加沙的政权并建立其在约旦河西岸的声望，这会对竞争对手法塔赫运动的领导人阿巴斯形成巨大的压力，迫使其接受按照哈马斯确定的条件组成的全国统一政府。 法塔赫中央委员会的成员已经开始指责阿巴斯在本次战争中支持以色列，想“坐在以色列的坦克上返回加沙 ” 。 法塔赫内部的激进团体，也想要和哈马斯公开结盟。 如果哈马斯提前发表观点，阿巴斯在其他巴勒斯坦派别中的盟友就会向其施加压力，迫使其在巴勒斯坦解放组织内部接受哈马斯和伊斯兰圣战组织。 埃及也将不得不为了恢复其在阿拉伯人中的形象和缓解埃及社会内部的紧张状态而放弃对哈马斯的抵制。 有些欧洲国家的政府，特别是巴黎和伦敦，也可能存在将哈马斯纳入巴勒斯坦政治的压力 — — 在巴黎和伦敦，有人甚至在战争爆发前就表示反对孤立哈马斯。 但是，如果以色列迫使哈马斯接受其边境控制和正式停火的条件，哈马斯作为巴勒斯坦抵抗运动守护人的形象就会遭到严重的破坏。 巴勒斯坦人就会怀疑，是否真的有必要进行这场战争并付出如此高昂的代价。 阿巴斯就可以声称，他已经建议哈马斯续订停火协议并结束对以色列城镇的导弹袭击，但是，哈马斯却坚持使巴勒斯坦平民遭受战争的荼毒。 对此次战争要关注的一个指标是：停火时间的长短。 巴勒斯坦人会将哈马斯接受与以色列达成为期几年的停火协议视为哈马斯战败的标志，而这也会增强巴勒斯坦人遭到羞辱和被抛弃了的感觉。 尽管发表了种种言论，但是真主党却没有采取措施支持哈马斯，而且，阿拉伯国家似乎非常乐意看到哈马斯失败。 哈马斯和阿巴斯竞争的厉害关系，在加沙战后重建中会增加。 得到美国和欧盟支持的阿巴斯，可能对大量的资金有控制权。 对阿巴斯的考验是快速分配资金进行重建。 哈马斯也有进行重建的资源。 支持哈马斯的卡塔尔，已经宣布建立一个加沙投资基金，并且捐助了2.5亿美元。 哈马斯必须提供有说服力的实例，来证明加沙的近乎毁灭是一个必须付出的代价。 许多巴勒斯坦人认为，以色列对加沙造成这样的破坏是为了分化巴勒斯坦人民和“抵抗运动 ” 。 这样的观点有一个先例可考：在2006年6月份黎巴嫩战争结束的时候，真主党将贝鲁特南部郊区遭到破坏，正是用这样的语言加以解释的。 更重要的是，哈马斯可以证明在此次战争中，其领导人到战争前线参加战斗，分担巴勒斯坦人的痛苦；许多哈马斯成员和他们的家人一起牺牲了。 最大的问题是，此次战争是否会改变哈马斯的政治目标。 两个星期前，哈马斯高级官员穆萨·阿卜·马祖卡（Musa Abu Marzouk）在《洛杉矶时报》上称赞吉米·卡特是给中东带来真正和平的唯一一位美国总统。 这和哈马斯总是将以色列和埃及签订的戴维营协议描绘成为对伊斯兰世界的背叛的观点，有巨大的差异。 阿卜·马祖卡（Musa Abu Marzouk）的观点是否只是一个为了刺激奥巴马政府接近哈马斯的策略，或者战争是否使哈马斯认识到两国共存方案是解决与以色列冲突的唯一可行选择，还有待观察。"

            "The Decline and Fall of William Barr ATLANTA – US law-enforcement officials are no strangers to politically motivated investigations. From Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer’s infamous “Red Raids” in 1919-20 to FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover’s pursuit of the Berrigan brothers and other nonviolent activists in the 1960s, political prosecutions are as American as apple pie. The Department of Justice under President Donald Trump appears to be continuing the tradition. No one is surprised that Trump himself is deploying every Orwellian device at his disposal to thwart the current impeachment inquiry in the House of Representatives. But it has been tragic to witness Attorney General William Barr following suit by launching investigations into career national-security officials just for doing their jobs. Owing to his paranoid obsession with a mythical “deep state,” Trump has long singled out FBI agents and CIA officers in his public attacks. It is these professionals, after all, who uncovered Russia’s operation to assist his presidential campaign in 2016, as outlined in the Mueller Report. But now, Barr, too, has decided to advance the “deep state” fiction on Trump’s behalf. Demonstrating an unprecedented level of involvement by an attorney general, Barr has traveled to both Rome and London, reportedly to question Italian and British officials in person about the origins of the Russia investigation. Barr’s actions raise the question whether he is acting as the nation’s top law-enforcement official, or as Trump’s own defense lawyer. In a phone call with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, Trump asked the Australians to assist Barr in his efforts. The blatant political message is impossible to miss. Existing treaties establish clear procedures for law-enforcement cooperation and intelligence sharing (through far more secure and discreet channels). If a US attorney general or US prosecutor needs an ally’s assistance in the course of a legitimate investigation, they can simply ask for it themselves. Moreover, it is no secret that Barr is trying to legitimize Trump’s “deep state” fantasy. He has said as much himself. Last May, he described the FBI’s counterintelligence investigation into Russian election interference as “spying” on the Trump campaign. When asked about his Trump-like choice of words, Barr resorted to conspiracy theory, suggesting that a “Praetorian Guard” within the US intelligence community may have had designs to influence US elections. Their threat to the republic, he said, was as great as Russian cyberattacks. Barr is currently reviewing a Justice Department Inspector General (IG) report on whether the FBI misled the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court in order to target Trump’s 2016 campaign. And the probe into the Russia investigation, now formally in the hands of John Durham, the US Attorney for the District of Connecticut, has apparently become a formal criminal inquiry. Durham’s investigation will all but certainly have a chilling effect on the US intelligence and law-enforcement communities. Already, Department of Justice investigators have reportedly sought to question CIA analysts about their work uncovering Russian interference on Trump’s behalf in 2016, even though both the Mueller Report and the intelligence community’s 17 agencies have unanimously confirmed that finding. Needless to say, having criminal prosecutors second-guess intelligence analysts’ judgment is not a very good way to encourage independent fact-finding, including into Russia’s ongoing efforts to interfere in US elections. For Trump, who still denies Russia’s interference in 2016 and derides the intelligence community’s work, perhaps that is precisely the point. National-security professionals should be particularly on guard for whatever is coming next. The office of the Justice Department Inspector General initially refused to accept written comments about its conclusions from those being questioned about the Russia probe, even though that is the standard procedure for ensuring that statements are accurate and thorough. Following public criticism, it has since said that it will accept written feedback. Reversal or not, the effort to prohibit comments in writing obviously raises concerns that the final report will attempt to politicize the underlying facts. Worse, Barr is planning to release the report in coordination with Trump’s allies in Congress, where Republicans are eager for ammunition to deflect attention from the impeachment proceedings. It is worth remembering that in March, just before the release of the full Mueller Report, Barr issued a four-page summary of that 450-page document that was widely criticized as misleading, including by Mueller himself. After consulting with Barr, Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a vocal Trump sycophant, has suggested that the IG’s report will include stunning revelations of abuses of a system that has gone “off the rails.” In his warning about an American “Praetorian Guard,” Barr condemned those who “identify the national interest with their own political preferences and … feel that anyone who has a different opinion, you know, is somehow an enemy of the state.” Following Trump’s example, his language was clearly an attack on the senior officials who oversaw the counterintelligence investigation into Russia’s election interference: former FBI Director James Comey, former CIA Director John Brennan, and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper. Time will tell whether Barr’s investigation of the investigators turns up anything of substance. His portentous hints of a deep-state conspiracy have left Trump stalwarts giddily awaiting the release of the IG report. In any event, congressional Republicans have now taken to maligning the career military officers and diplomats who have come before them in the impeachment hearings. At this point, they aren’t likely to change their tune. The question is whether Barr will change his. Last May, Jan Crawford of CBS asked Barr if he worried that his service to Trump might damage his reputation. “Everyone dies,” he said. “I don’t believe in the Homeric idea that … immortality comes by … having odes sung about you over the centuries.” Perhaps that response is the best one can hope to hear from an attorney general who is comfortable peddling conspiracy theories to justify otherwise dubious investigations that please his boss. As for how Barr may be viewed in the fullness of time, there are historical parallels. The Soviet prosecutor Andrei Vyshinsky played a prominent role in the Nuremberg trials, held high academic posts, and became one of his country’s top diplomats. But before that, he was the chief prosecutor in Stalin’s murderous show trials. Today, that is the only thing for which he is remembered.",
            "威廉·巴尔的衰亡 亚特兰大—美国执法官员对于出于政治动机的调查早已耳熟能详。 从1919-20年间司法部长米切尔·鲍尔默（Mitchell Palmer）臭名昭著的“红色突袭 ” ， 到20世纪60年代联邦调查局局长埃德加·胡佛（Edgar Hoover）抓捕贝里甘兄弟（Berrigan brothers）和其他非暴力活动家，政治起诉和苹果派一样都是美国特色。 特朗普总统治下的司法部似乎延续着这一传统。 特朗普本人无所不用其极地运用一切奥威尔式手段以挫败众议院正在进行的弹劾调查，这一点都不令人奇怪。 但司法部长威廉·巴尔（William Barr）惟其马首是瞻，因为职业国家安全官员履行分内职责而发动对他们的调查，这是一个悲剧。 特朗普偏执地执着于子虚乌有的“深海状态 ” （ deep state ） ， 联邦调查局特工和中央情报局官员向来是他公开攻讦的对象。 毕竟，正是这些专业人士揭发了俄罗斯在2016年总统竞选中帮助他的行为，都列在穆勒报告（Mueller Report）中。 但如今，巴尔也决定代表特朗普推动“深海状态”传说。 巴尔前往罗马和伦敦，据说是以个人身份质询意大利和英国官员俄罗斯调查的源头，这是司法部长前所未有地参与案件。 巴尔的行为让人质疑他是在以国家最高执法官员的身份行动，还是特朗普本人的辩护律师。 在于澳大利亚总理莫里森的电话中，特朗普要求澳方协助巴尔。 个中政治含义不可不谓赤裸裸。 现有条约为执法合作和情报共享做出了明确的流程规定（通过远为更加安全谨慎的渠道进行 ） 。 如果美国司法部长或美国检察官需要盟友协助某项合法调查，他们大可以本人提出要求。 此外，巴尔试图将特朗普的“深海状态”幻想合理化早已不是秘密。 他本人就这么说。 去年5月，他说联邦调查局对俄罗斯选举干预的反情报调查是对特朗普选战的“间谍”活动。 在被问及为何使用特朗普式的用词时，巴尔祭出阴谋论，表示美国情报界内部的“禁卫军”决定影响美国选举。 他说，他们对共和国的威胁于俄罗斯的网络袭击等量齐观。 目前，巴尔正在评估一份司法部监察长（IG）关于联邦调查局是否误导海外情报监督法庭（Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court）针对特朗普2016年选战的报告。 而对俄罗斯调查的调查 — — 目前形式上由美国康涅狄格区检察官约翰·杜尔厄姆（John Durham）负责 — — 已显然变成了正式的刑事调查。 杜尔厄姆的调查必然将给美国情报和执法界造成寒蝉效应。 目前，司法部调查员据说已试图质询中央情报局分析员揭发2016年俄罗斯干预特朗普行为的工作，尽管穆勒报告和情报机关的17位特工一致确认了这一发现。 不消说，让刑事检察官事后批判情报分析员的判断对于独立事实探寻 — — 包括俄罗斯还在进行的干预美国选举的行为 — — 绝不是好办法。 对特朗普来说 — — 他仍然否认2016年有俄罗斯干预，并哂笑情报机关的工作 — — 这也许正是重要之处。 国家安全人员应该得到特别保护，不需为此后发生什么负责。 司法部监察长办公室最初拒绝接受关于其得自接受俄罗斯调查案质询的人员的结论的书面评论，尽管这是确保陈述准确详实的标准流程。 在公开批评之后，其又表示将接受书面反馈。 不管有没有撤回，试图禁止书面评论显然引起了人们对于最终报告将试图把基本事实政治化的担忧。 更糟糕的是，巴尔计划在特朗普的国会盟友的协调下发布报告。 国会共和党急切地想要转移弹劾流程注意力的“弹药 ” 。 不妨回忆一下，3月份，就在完整的穆勒报告发布之前，巴尔发布了一份关于这宗450页的案卷的页长的摘要，被包括穆勒本人在内广泛批评为误导。 在咨询了巴尔后，特朗普的奉承者、南卡罗莱纳参议员林赛·格雷厄姆（Lindsey Graham）表示，IG的报告将揭示令人震惊的对已经“脱轨”的制度的滥用。 巴尔警告美国出现“禁卫军 ” ， 谴责“将国家利益与个人政治偏好划等号并 … … 认为所有意见不一者，你懂的，都是国家敌人”的人。 效方特朗普的榜样，他的用词明显是对负责俄罗斯干预大选的反情报调查的高级官员的攻讦，包括联邦调查局前局长詹姆斯·科米（James Comey ） 、 中央情报局前局长约翰·布伦南（John Brennan）和前国家情报主任詹姆斯·克莱珀（James Clapper ） 。 时间会告诉我们巴尔对调查员的调查是否有实质性的内容。 他对深海状态阴谋的强烈暗示让特朗普党羽们欣喜若狂地等待IG报告发布。 无论如何，国会共和党已开始公开诽谤在弹劾听证中坐在他们面前的职业军官和外交官。 目前，他们不会转换基调。 问题在于巴尔会不会改变他的基调。 去年5月，CBS的詹·克劳福德（Jan Crawford）问巴尔会不会因为为特朗普服务有损于自己的名声而担忧。 “每个人都会死 ， ” 他说 ， “ 我不相信荷马时代的观点，即 … … 不朽源自 … … 人们吟唱你的事迹几百年 。 ” 这一回应也许是你能从一位心安理得地兜售阴谋论来论证为了取悦他的上司而进行的疑点白出的调查的司法部长身上得到的最佳回答。 至于历史会怎么平价巴尔，倒是有一些先例。 苏联检察官安德烈·维辛斯基（Andrei Vyshinsky）在纽伦堡审判中扮演了主要角色，占据了学术高位，并成为苏联顶级外交关。 但在此之前，他也是斯大林走过场的谋杀审判的检察官。 而如今，这是他唯一被铭记的事迹。"

            "The Long March of “General” William Barr NEW YORK – The death of George Floyd, an unarmed and handcuffed black man, at the hands – or, more accurately, the knee – of a police officer in Minneapolis ignited massive protests across the United States against systemic racism and police brutality. It also spurred a growing number of people outside the US to confront the legacies of racism and inequality in their own countries. Donald Trump’s administration, however, is doing no such thing. Instead, the Trump administration has continued – even accelerated – its effort to hollow out America’s institutions in favor of a nihilistic populism. Its ultimate goal remains unchanged: to create a full-fledged illiberal regime in the US. No one is more committed to this dream than William Barr, Trump’s attorney general. Barr may not have the foggiest idea who Antonio Gramsci was; Trump almost certainly doesn’t. But Barr’s lust for power and Trump’s feral cunning seem to have led the two men to intuit the Italian Marxist philosopher’s theory of cultural hegemony: the idea that the ruling class gains society’s consent to the status quo by ensuring that a country’s institutions embody and promote a legitimating ideology. Schools, courts, religious institutions, and the media, for example, can play a powerful role in in the internalization of norms, values, and beliefs. Trump, Barr, and US Republicans more generally have used all of these institutions. But, in response to the ongoing protests, the Trump administration has gone a step further, deploying law enforcement and even the military to advance their ideological ends. On June 1, Barr – who, it is said, relishes the “general” in his job title – ordered the expansion of the protective perimeter that had been set up around the White House. Officers fulfilled that mission – which involved clearing peaceful protesters from Lafayette Park, the site of many important protests in America’s history – using tear gas, smoke bombs, pepper spray, police batons, horses, and riot shields. Trump then waddled across the emptied park in order to be photographed awkwardly holding a Bible in front of St. John’s Church. Barr stood proudly nearby, alongside a real general, Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who, after a tidal wave of criticism, subsequently expressed regret for having participated. “My presence in that moment and in that environment,” Milley acknowledged, “created a perception of the military involved in domestic politics.” In fact, it was worse than that: the stunt called into question the US military’s 240-year-old tradition of remaining strictly apolitical. Trump insists that his politicization of the military is a matter of upholding “law and order” – a phrase that harks back to Richard Nixon, another tough-talking US president with autocratic aspirations. Though the demonstrations have been mostly peaceful, Trump claims that using force against protesters is actually an “act of compassion,” because it supposedly “saves lives.” Antonio Gramsci, meet George Orwell. Former senior US military leaders see through the Trump administration’s deceit and have condemned the Lafayette Square stunt. General James Mattis, Trump’s own former secretary of defense, said this “abuse of executive authority” made “a mockery” of the US Constitution. Over 1,000 former justice department officials published a letter requesting an internal review of Barr’s handling of the protests. But both Barr and Trump are as committed as ever to their pursuit of illiberal cultural hegemony. Trump has demonized protesters, including by touting the absurd conspiracy theory that a 75-year-old protester whom police were caught on camera shoving to the ground was an “Antifa provocateur.” He also attempted to deploy 10,000 active-duty troops in the streets of Washington, DC, to “dominate” the demonstrators, whom he calls “thugs.” Likewise, Barr has played up the violence, claiming – without any evidence – that “far-left extremist groups” are stoking it. And he actually did deploy his own “army”: federal correctional officers – trained in quelling prison riots, not managing peaceful protests – who wore black clothes without badges or other insignia. There is, however, a key difference between Trump and Barr. The former is a reality-TV autocrat content to think that pretending to be strong makes him strong, even as he hides in a bunker and behind an impossibly high security fence. (Having been born in Russia, I am all too familiar with a president who hides behind high walls that are supposed to symbolize power, but actually betray the state’s fear of civil society.) Barr, by contrast, is a determined apparatchik. While Trump asserts that his authority is “absolute,” Barr is dedicated to carrying out the “long march through the institutions” – in the words of Rudi Dutschke, the 1960s German radical leader who studied Gramsci’s work – required to make that claim true. This has meant, for example, undermining Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 presidential election, and forcing federal prosecutors to drop their case against Trump’s first national security adviser, General Michael Flynn. His latest assault on democracy is the dismissal of US Attorney Geoffrey Berman, a Manhattan-based federal prosecutor who has investigated several of Trump’s associates. Barr has not corrupted his office and chipped away at executive accountability and transparency merely out of personal loyalty to Trump. His motivations are ideological. As a staunch proponent of the theory of a unitary executive, he wholeheartedly subscribes to the view that a president’s power is all-encompassing. By this logic, Trump has the right to gut any investigation into his actions, and congressional oversight of the presidency should be severely curtailed. Barr’s “chilling vision of unchecked presidential power,” as the journalist Damon Linker calls it, is akin to that of Carl Schmitt, the Nazis’ favorite legal philosopher. General Barr is thus a true Gauleiter. And, under Trump, he has been given the ultimate opportunity to implement his ideology, whatever the consequences for America’s constitutional order. I suspect that even Gramsci would be stunned by how openly Barr has deployed the “apparatus of state coercive power” to enforce “discipline on those groups who do not ‘consent’” to Trump’s – and Barr’s – own hegemony.",
            "威廉·巴尔“总”的长征 纽约—手无寸铁的黑人乔治·弗洛伊德（George Floyd）被反剪双手，在明尼阿波利斯死于某警官之手（更准确地说，是之膝 ） ， 在美国点燃了大规模示威，反对系统性的种族主义和警察暴力；也激发越来越多美国之外的人民直面本国种族主义和不平等性的遗留问题。 特朗普的政府可做不出这样的事情。 相反，特朗普政府仍在变本加厉地破坏美国制度以利于虚无缥缈的民粹主义。 其终极目标始终未变：在美国建立完整的反自由体制。 对此最为热衷的莫过于特朗普的司法部长威廉·巴尔（William Barr ） 。 巴尔也许对安东尼奥·葛兰西（Antonio Gramsci）是谁一无所知；特朗普几乎肯定不知道。 但巴尔对权力的渴求以及特朗普的狡猾让这两人与这位意大利马克思主义哲学家的文化霸权理论不谋而合：统治阶级通过确保一国制度采用和推动合法化的意识形态而赢得社会对现状的同意。 比如，学校、法院、宗教机构和媒体能够在规范、价值观和信念的国际化方面起到强大作用。 特朗普、巴尔和美国共和党总体上利用了所有这些机构。 但是，为了应对方兴未艾的示威，特朗普政府更近一步，部署执法部门乃至军队来推进他们的意识形态目标。 6月1日，巴尔 — — 据说他非常珍视他那带“总 ” （ general）的头衔，下令扩大白宫周边防卫设施。 警察完成了这一任务 — — 包括清场美国历史上众多重要示威的发生地拉法叶公园（Lafayette Park）的和平示威者 — — 动用了催泪弹、烟幕弹、辣椒水、警棍、马匹和防暴盾牌。 接着，特朗普大摇大摆走过空旷的公园，只为拍摄一张在圣约翰教堂前手持圣经的笨拙照片。 巴尔骄傲地站在一旁，身边是真正的将军（general ） 、 参谋长联席会议主席马克·米利（Mark Milley ） ， 他随后在遭到口诛笔伐之后表示后悔参与了此次活动。 “我在这个时间出现在这样的环境中 ， ” 米利坦承 ， “ 营造了一种军方卷入内政的感觉 。 ” 事实要比这更加糟糕：这让美国军方240年来严格不干预政治的传统受到了质疑。 特朗普说，他的军队政治化是为了维护 “法律和秩序 ” — —这让人想起了另一位说话强硬、带着专制野心的美国总统尼克松。 尽管示威大体而言是和平的，但特朗普声称动用武力对付示威者其实是“同情”之举，因为其目的是“拯救生命 ” 。 安东尼奥·葛兰西遇上了乔治·奥威尔（George Orwell ） 。 美国军方前领导人看穿了特朗普政府的把戏，谴责拉法叶广场的做法。 特朗普自己的前国防部长詹姆斯·马蒂斯（James Mattis）将军说这一“行政权力的滥用”让美国宪法沦为“笑柄 ” 。 1000多位前司法部官员发表了一封信，要求就巴尔处置示威的方式进行内部调查。 但巴尔和特朗普对于反自由文化霸权的追逐丝毫没有收敛。 特朗普将示威者妖魔化，炮制了荒谬的阴谋论，说一名被拍到被警察推倒在地75岁的示威者是“反法西斯煽动者 ” 。 他还试图在华盛顿街头部署10000名现役部队，以“支配”他称为 “暴徒”的示威者。 类似地，巴尔也玩弄暴力，他（在毫无证据的情况下）说这是被“极左翼极端组织”挑起的。 他确实部署了他自己的“大军 ” ： 联邦惩教官 — — 他们受到的训练是镇压监狱暴动，而不是和平示威 — — 身穿没有徽章或其他标记的黑衣。 但是，特朗普和巴尔有一个重要区别。 前者是一位擅长做秀的独裁者，认为装作强大就可以让自己强大，即便他躲在掩体之中，前面有坚不可摧的安全隔离保护。 （我出生在俄罗斯，对于躲在本应用于象征权力，但实际上却出卖了国家害怕公民社会的高墙之后的总统再熟悉不过了。 ） 相反，巴尔是一名坚定的职业党员。 特朗普说他的权威是“绝对的 ” ， 而巴尔则致力于实现“穿越制度的长征 ” — —20世纪德国激进派领袖、研究过葛兰西主作的鲁迪·杜契克（Rudi Dutschke）语 — — 只有这样才能让特朗普对话成为现实。 比如，这意味着破坏特别检察官罗伯特·穆勒（Robert Mueller）关于俄罗斯干涉2016年总统竞选的调查，以及强迫联邦检察官撤销针对特朗普的首任国家安全顾问迈克尔·弗林（Michael Flynn）将军的指控。 他最近对民主的抨击是解雇了美国司法部曼哈顿联邦检察官乔佛里·伯尔曼（Geoffrey Berman ） ， 他调查过多名特朗普的助手。 巴尔没有腐化他的部门，将行政问责和透明度与对特朗普的个人忠诚剥离。 他的动机是意识形态。 作为行政独大理论的坚定支持者，他全心全意支持总统权力无所不包的观点。 根据这一逻辑，特朗普有权阻止任何对他的行为的调查，国会对总统的监督应该严格限定。 巴尔的“令人惊悚的不受制衡的总统权力观点 ” — —记者达蒙·林克（Damon Linker）语 — — 很像是纳粹最喜欢的法哲学家卡尔·施密特（Carl Schmitt ） 。 司法部长巴尔是一名真正的长官。 在特朗普手下，他得到了落实他的意识形态的终极机会，不管这会给美国宪政秩序带来什么后果。 我怀疑，哪怕是葛兰西，也会震惊于巴尔公开部署 “国家暴力机器”执行“不‘同意 ’ ” 特朗普 — — 进而也是巴尔自己的“群体的规训 ” 。"

            "The Framing of MH-17 PHILADELPHIA – US President Barack Obama called the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 an “outrage of unspeakable proportions,” whereas Russian President Vladimir Putin termed it an “accident” and a “terrible tragedy.” Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko branded it an “act of terrorism,” and Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak called it an “inhumane, uncivilized, violent, and irresponsible act.” All of these descriptions may be accurate, but each carries different rhetorical weight and legal implications. The time has come for governments and international organizations to call the attack on MH17 a probable war crime. This rhetorical shift is needed, first and foremost, because framing the moral reprehensibility of this despicable act within a common language will help to align public perceptions of it. As it stands, the public narrative in Russia and the West diverges sharply. Russian media and officials portray the episode as, at best, a terrible mistake, and, at worst, an American plot to undermine support for the rebels. Americans and Europeans, for their part, increasingly blame Russia for possibly equipping or assisting the rebels. As a result, the possibility of achieving a common understanding of the act is being lost – and, with it, whatever potential there may be for meaningful cooperation. But, by recognizing the downing of MH17 as a war crime, governments may be able to create an opening to reconcile these narratives. Whatever the perpetrators’ underlying motives, there is no denying the moral and legal wrongdoing that occurred. Calling the offense by its legal name acknowledges this, thereby preempting a rhetorical battle to frame the attack as terror, tragedy, or conspiracy. Even the Russians may be willing to accept this framing, because it avoids finger-pointing against particular actors and affirms that a court of law – not a series of media statements – will determine what occurred and who is responsible. In fact, another important reason to characterize the downing of MH17 publicly as a war crime is that it may prove beneficial in apprehending the perpetrators. There is a real danger that those responsible for pressing the launch button – and, perhaps, for ordering the launch – will disappear into the chaos of eastern Ukraine, the vast expanses of Russia, or elsewhere. There is also a danger that the perpetrators, if found, might avoid trial if the local authorities label the crime political, and thus exempt from normal extradition requirements. All of the relevant states in the region have accepted the legal obligation to assist in the investigation and prosecution of war crimes. The obligation to prosecute suspected war criminals, or extradite them to face prosecution elsewhere, becomes more compelling in accordance with the seriousness of the alleged crime. While the full details of the attack on MH17 remain unknown, shooting a surface-to-air missile at a civilian airliner flying over a war zone is most likely a violation of the law of war – by which the Ukrainian government, the Russian government, and the rebels are all bound. Indeed, the conflict in eastern Ukraine constitutes a non-international armed conflict (a war between a government and rebel movement) governed by international humanitarian law, which categorically bans the intentional targeting of civilians. In other words, if whoever launched the missile did so with the intent of killing the civilian passengers aboard MH17, the act was unmistakably a war crime. Even if the objective was to strike a Ukrainian transport aircraft, the act likely constitutes a war crime. Fundamental to the law of war, including the law applicable in non-international armed conflicts, is the principle of distinction – the requirement that fighting parties distinguish between civilian and military targets. In the words of the International Committee of the Red Cross, that duty of care includes doing “everything feasible to verify that targets are military objectives.” In this case, many steps could easily have been taken to differentiate MH17 from a military-transport plane, including visual identification (perhaps with binoculars), radar-signature analysis, and a check of the civilian aircraft transponder-code broadcast. If, as seems likely, these basic steps were not taken, even an accidental strike on MH17 would constitute a war crime. A Dutch or Malaysian court, or even a special tribunal under the auspices of the United Nations (like the one that prosecuted the 1988 Pan Am Lockerbie bombing), will ultimately determine who bears legal responsibility for the downing of MH17. Framing the attack as a likely war crime now – as UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay has done – may help to reconcile the conflicting narratives that are emerging. And, perhaps more important, doing so can play a key role in securing the political, diplomatic, and legal support needed to bring the perpetrators to justice.",
            "MH-17事件的框架 费城 — — 美国总统奥巴马称马航17航班被击落所引发的“愤怒难以言表 ” ， 而俄罗斯总统普京则用“意外”和“可怕的悲剧”来形容。 乌克兰总统波罗申科称之为一次“恐怖事件 ” ， 而马来西亚总理纳吉布·拉扎克则称上述行为“反人道、反文明、暴力且不负责任 。 ” 上述所有说法可能都有道理，但其修辞重点和法律内涵则各有不同。 政府和国际组织是时候将MH17遇袭事件定性为潜在的战争罪行。 这种说法上的转变很有必要，因为用所有人都听得懂的语言指出这种卑劣行径的道德错误对统一公众看法很有帮助。 目前俄罗斯和西方的公众说法截然不同。 俄罗斯媒体和官员充其量把此次事件说成是可怕的错误，甚至说成是美国人削弱对叛军支持的阴谋。 而美欧则越来越多地指责俄罗斯可能为叛军提供装备或者协助。 结果是就上述行为达成共识的可能性越来越小 — — 开展有意义合作的机会也正在消失。 但如果认定击落MH17属于战争罪行，各国政府或许可以打破坚冰，统一态度。 无论肇事者出于何种潜在动机，此次事件是道德和法律犯罪都是无可否认的。 用合法名称来形容此次事件承认了这一基本事实，并对恐怖、悲剧和阴谋论进行了有力的反驳。 就连俄国人都有可能愿意接受这一框架，因为这样做避免了指责特定人员，并确保将由法院而不是媒体来决定事实真相和责任者。 事实上，将击落MH17公开定性为战争罪的另一重要原因是这样做或许有利于逮捕肇事者。 按下发射按钮 — — 或者也许是下达发射命令的人的确有可能消失在混乱的乌克兰东部和俄罗斯广袤的国土当中。 此外，还有可能即便找到了凶手，地方当局也会以政治犯罪为由让凶手逃避审判，避开正常的引渡请求。 该地区所有相关国家都认可协助战争罪调查和起诉的法律义务。 所谓战争罪越严重，起诉犯罪嫌疑人、或将其引渡到其他地方接受审判的义务就愈加引人注目。 虽然MH17遇袭的全部细节尚不清楚，但用地空导弹袭击飞越战区上空的民航客机无疑违反了战争法 — — 乌克兰政府、俄罗斯政府和叛军均应受到该法的约束。 事实上，乌克兰东部冲突属非国际性武装冲突（政府和反叛运动作战）性质，需要遵守国际人道主义法，其中明确禁止蓄意袭击平民目标。 换句话说，如果导弹发射者想要杀害搭乘MH17的平民乘客，那么该行为明白无误属于战争罪的范畴。 即使原定目标是击落乌克兰运输机，上述行为仍有可能属于战争罪的范畴。 战争法，包括非国际性武装冲突法的基本原则是要区别对待，要求交战方分清平民和军事目标。 用红十字国际委员会的话说，这项义务包括“尽一切可能确认目标是否是军事目标 。 ” 在这种情况下，有很多手段可以轻松区分MH17和军事运输机，其中包括视觉识别（或许采用双筒望远镜 ） 、 雷达信号分析和民用飞机应答码广播核查。 如果看似并未采取这些基本措施，那么即使误中MH17也有可能划入战争罪的范畴。 一家荷兰或马来西亚法院，甚或是联合国授权的一家特别法院（比如1988年起诉泛美洛克比空难的法院）将决定在法律层面谁来为击落MH17航班负责。 像联合国高级人权专员皮莱那样将此次袭击作为潜在的战争罪行对待可能有助于统一不断出现的矛盾叙述。 而且，更重要的是，这样做能在争取将肇事者绳之以法所需的政治、外交和法律支持中起到关键的作用。"

            "China’s New Reforms in Theory and Practice HONG KONG – On November 12, the Third Plenary of the 18th Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) announced a major turn to market-oriented policies: interest-rate and currency liberalization, reform of banks and state enterprises, clearer land ownership for rural inhabitants, and a better deal for urban migrants. Behind this landmark decision was a potential crisis. China’s success has been driven by cheap exports based on cheap labor, infrastructure built by state enterprises with low-cost bank funding, and government budgets funded by land sales. But labor is no longer cheap, road construction to connect major cities has given way to building large shopping malls in small towns, and land sales based on rezoning are reaching both economic limits and the limits of villagers’ tolerance. Cheap money with limited investment outlets now risks fueling property bubbles and industrial overcapacity. Without fundamental change, China faces slower economic growth, inadequate job creation and innovation, and popping bubbles. The solution is a rapid shift from China’s export-based growth model to one based on domestic demand; from infrastructure to consumption; from the dominance of large state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to that of small and medium-size private enterprises; from industry to services; and, more broadly, from bureaucratic control to market control. All successful Asian countries have made this shift; South Korea and Taiwan are models. But rapid change entails immense pain. SOEs will lose their low-interest loans, subsidized land, monopoly protection, and privileged housing. Party and state bureaucracies will lose power (and income). Local governments are particularly desperate. They have huge debts, which they amortize by rezoning and selling land. Already squeezed by exorbitant property prices and popular resistance to land takings, they now face higher interest rates, property taxes, villagers empowered by stronger rights, and expensive new requirements to provide social services to migrants. The desperation of local potentates and SOE executives has created powerful resistance to reform. At a plenary reportedly marked by acrimony, China’s political leaders sided with reform. As one economic planner said, when asked about resistance before the decisive meeting, “In the end, all of our leaders understand numbers. The implications of the numbers are clear.” The Third Plenum’s announcement of its decisions took the form of a statement of broad principles, leaving many observers concerned by the lack of detail. But the CCP’s role is to set the direction of policy; executing the Party’s decisions is the government’s job. And the Plenum did establish a top-level group to coordinate and enforce implementation of its decisions. While implementation will be a long struggle, with occasionally fierce resistance, key reforms are already underway. The current 12th Five-Year Plan calls for annual wage increases to average at least 13.4%; this year, wages are rising at an average rate of 18%, which will squeeze out industries characterized by obsolescence or overcapacity. Moreover, the government’s anti-corruption campaign is targeting some of the most powerful industry groups, such as the petroleum faction, thereby weakening their resistance to reform. Most important, economic outcomes are becoming increasingly aligned with the authorities’ goals. Services already account for more output and employment than industry – the Internet company Alibaba, for example, is empowering both consumers and smaller companies on a previously unimaginable scale – and recent growth has been driven by domestic demand rather than net exports. Reform is not just a plan; it is already happening. Economic openings to Central Asia and to ASEAN (specifically to Vietnam) are well underway, and reform will include further international opening. The Third Plenum’s decisions follow the launch in September of the Shanghai Free-Trade Zone, which will open new sectors to foreign investment and permit largely market-based financial transactions and capital flows. The liberalization of capital flows is intended to be a gradual national policy, channeled through trusted institutions in Shanghai. For trade in goods, the new free-trade zone is intended to compete directly with Singapore and Hong Kong. China fears dependence on those entrepôts in the event of conflict. For foreign investors, the policy will be to expand greatly the range of opportunities while curtailing foreign control; foreign companies, for example, may hold minority stakes in the telecoms sector, while dominant foreign companies like Monsanto will face constraints. President Xi Jinping faces the politically risky task of pushing the CCP’s reform agenda against fierce opposition while the economy slows. By emphasizing Party control – through a crackdown on SOEs, government opponents, and critics in the media and academia – Xi seeks to maximize his ability to impose economic reforms while minimizing the risk of a challenge from conservative forces. Above all, he is determined to avoid the fate of previous Chinese leaders like Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang, who lost their jobs after a critical mass of their opponents came to believe that economic and political reform jeopardized Party control. So, at least for now, China will focus on another great wave of economic reform, whereas political reform will mostly be limited to reorganization of government agencies to boost efficiency and strengthen efforts to reduce corruption. (There have been some steps toward reform, including a decision to remove judges from local political control.) And yet China will find it increasingly difficult to postpone stronger measures that would appease popular demands for fairness, including the establishment of an independent judiciary, which could prove to be no less an imperative than structural economic reforms. Likewise, the leaders must either accept much of the information revolution’s swamping of controls or engage in far more costly repression. Hopes for political reform rest on the possibility that Xi’s second term will see the accession to top leadership of reformers like Politburo member Wang Yang and Vice President Li Yuanchao. For now, however, China will focus on another great wave of economic reform.",
            "中国新改革：理论与实践 香港—11月12日，中国十八大三中全会宣布了一组重大的市场化转向政策：利率和货币自由化、银行和国有企业改革、更清晰的农村居民土地所有权、以及更好的城市农民工待遇。 隐藏在这一划时代决定背后的是一场潜在危机。 中国的成功一直是由基于廉价劳动力的廉价出口、廉价银行资金支持的国有企业建设的基础设施以及土地销售提供资金的政府预算推动的。 但劳动力不再廉价、连接主要城市的道路建设已经变成了在小城镇建设大型购物城，基于重新规划的土地销售已经达到了经济和村民容忍力的双重极限。 如今，廉价的资金加上投资渠道受限有可能助长房地产泡沫和工业产能过剩。 如果没有根本性变化，中国面临着经济增速减慢、就业创造和创新不足和泡沫破裂的风险。 解决办法在于迅速地从基于出口的增长模式转变为基于内需；从基础设施转变为消费；从大型国有企业主导转变为中小型民营企业；从工业转变为服务业；以及更广泛地，从官僚控制转变为市场控制。 所有亚洲成功经济体都做过这一转变；韩国和中国台湾堪称榜样。 但快速变化意味着阵痛。 国有企业将失去低息贷款、受补贴土地、垄断保护和福利住房。 党和国家官僚将失去权力（以及收入 ） 。 地方政府尤其着急。 它们背负着巨额债务，对于这些债务，它们通过再规划和销售土地摊销。 除了房价过高、群众对征地的抵制之外，地方政府现在还面临利率提高、房产税、村民力量和权利增加以及为农民工提供社会保证的需要大笔开支的新要求。 地方执政者和国有企业掌门人的焦急构成了对改革的重大阻碍。 据说三中全会中充满了斗争，最终中国政治领导人站在了改革一边。 一位经济计划官员在这次决定性会议前被问及遭遇的抵制时回答说 ： “ 说到底，我们的领导人都明白数字。 数字的影响力是毫不含糊的 。 ” 三中全会的决定以提纲挈领的形式公布，让许多观察者担心缺少细节。 但中共的角色是决定政策方向；执行党的决定是政府的责任。 三中全会确实成立了顶层领导小组协调和强制其决定的实施。 实施将是一场长期斗争，会遇到一些激烈抵制，但关键改革已经上路。 当前的十二五规划要求工资增长平均至少为13.4 % ； 今年，工资增长平均率为18 % ， 这将挤压过时和产能过剩的行业。 此外，政府的反腐运动将目标定向一些权力最大的工业集团，比如石化行业，从而削弱了对改革的抵制。 最重要的是，经济结果日益与当局的目标相一致。 服务业对产出和就业的贡献已超过工业 — — 比如，互联网公司阿里巴巴以此前难以想象的规模壮大了消费者和小公司 — — 且近期的增长受内需而不是出口推动。 改革不仅仅是计划，而是正在进行时。 向中亚和东盟（特别是越南）开放经济也在积极展开，而改革将包括进一步的国际开放。 在三中全会的决定之前，9月份在上海成立了自由贸易区，自贸区将向外国投资开放新部门，允许基本由市场决定的金融交易和资本流。 资本流动自由化将成为常规国家政策，由上海的可信机构作为渠道。 对于商品贸易，新自贸区将直接与新加坡与香港竞争。 中国担心在面临冲突事件时过度依赖香港和新加坡等中转站。 对外国投资者来说，这一政策将极大地扩大机会，同时限制外国控制；比如，外国公司可以成为电信部门的少数股东，但孟山都等国际大公司将面临约束。 在经济放缓的背景下战胜反对者、推动中共的改革日程是习近平主席面临的高风险政治任务。 习近平强调党的控制 — — 通过打压国有企业、政府反对派和媒体和学界的批评 — — 以此寻求推动改革能力最大化和保守派挑战风险最小化。 总之，习近平要避免前任中国领导人胡耀邦和赵紫阳的命运。 胡耀邦和赵紫阳因为反对者认为经济和政治改革威胁到了党的控制而被迫下台。 因此，至少从现在看，中国将专注于新一轮伟大的经济改革，而政治改革最有可能将局限于重组政府机构以增进效率以及打击腐败。 （改革之路已经跨出了一些步骤，包括取消地方政治控制法官。 ） 但中国将会发现，中止迎合公众对公正的要求的更强有力的措施将变得越来越困难，建立司法独立就是其中之一，这将是不亚于结构性经济改革的当务之急。 类似地，领导人要么接受信息革命对控制力的颠覆，要么实施代价高昂的打压。 政治改革的希望在于，在习近平的第二个任期，政治局委员汪洋和国家副主席李源潮等改革派能进入最高层。 但是，眼下中国将专注于新一轮伟大的经济改革。"

            "China’s Xi Factor HONG KONG – Before China’s leadership transition earlier this year, experts said that the Chinese Communist Party was intent on preventing a larger-than-life personality from assuming power. The CCP, it was argued, wanted someone more like the bureaucratic outgoing leader, Hu Jintao, rather than a charismatic successor like, say, the former Chongqing provincial governor Bo Xilai. Yet the new president and CCP leader, Xi Jinping, is hardly dull. He began his term by paying homage to Deng Xiaoping at his statue in Shenzhen, where, more than three decades ago, the former Communist Party leader had launched the campaign to convert a reluctant Party to free-market reforms. In a top-level November meeting, Xi set out the details of a fundamental change in economic direction, overshadowing his colleagues. Xi now leads a new economic group that will coordinate and impose his reforms on fractious colleagues. And, unlike Hu, he immediately became head of the military and now runs a parallel national security council. At first glance, a new “paramount leader” appears to be emerging. Recent history explains this re-concentration of power. In 1993, central-government leaders enjoyed relatively limited powers: they did not control the money supply and had difficulty firing provincial governors or relocating top generals. Central government revenue was low; indeed, proportionately smaller than that of central governments in any other major economy. This changed when then-Party leader Jiang Zemin and his prime minister, Zhu Rongji, centralized authority in order to stave off economic crisis at a time of growing risk to China’s banks. In the process, the labor force of China’s state enterprises declined by 50 million, China lost 25 million manufacturing jobs, and central-government employment was slashed. These measures saved China’s economy, but at the price of widespread social stress, which made Zhu widely disliked when he left office. Popular reaction against the cosmopolitan, coastal, and market-oriented reforms of Zhu and Jiang brought to power leaders whose formative experiences were in the inland provinces of Gansu and Tibet. Riding a wave of resentment against inequality and social tensions, Hu and his prime minister, Wen Jiabao, promised a “harmonious society,” without the stresses of Zhu’s agenda. They slowed economic reform and ceased political reforms. The bureaucracy expanded from 40 million to 70 million, and power devolved to provinces, bureaucracies, and state-owned enterprises (SOEs). The somnolent Hu/Wen era, fortunately, did not dampen the economic growth triggered by the earlier reforms undertaken by Jiang and Zhu. But the economic-growth model that those reforms created was running out of steam. Low-cost exports were struggling as labor costs rose. Investment in infrastructure was shifting from growth-enhancing projects, such as inter-city highways, to less productive shopping malls in second- and third-tier cities. Productivity plummeted in SOEs, whose privileged access to financing crowded out private-sector investment. Local-government funding, through the seizure and resale of property, was reaching its limits. Thus, it became essential to launch a new wave of far-reaching reforms, including liberalization of interest rates, securities markets, and foreign-exchange controls, in order to fund the more productive private sector and reduce excess capacity in SOEs. In particular, the reforms were needed to deflate an emerging property bubble resulting from huge savings and foreign capital inflows that had no other profitable investment outlet. The government planned to liberalize interest rates and the capital account to encourage investment in modern, high-value industries, rather than continue to subsidize low-value exports. It started to shift the economy’s base from export-oriented industries to domestic growth, and from manufacturing to services. And it announced its intention to slow local governments’ seizures of farmland and excessive borrowing through captive enterprises. Unsurprisingly, opposition to reform was implacable. SOEs were determined to defend their privileges. Highly leveraged local governments could not tolerate higher interest rates or an appreciating currency, and they were adamant about continuing land sales and opposing property taxes. They feared the financial burden of new requirements to provide social services to urban migrants. As a result, a new, lean leadership team had to be mobilized. The number of top leaders was cut from nine to seven. The new lineup eliminated the most powerful voice on the left (Bo) and relegated the “extreme reformers” on the right (Li Yuanchao and Wang Yang) to the second tier. To reduce elders’ interference, Hu stepped down as head of the military and Jiang Zemin promised to step back. Moreover, a leading economic group was established to enforce bureaucratic compliance, as was a national security council (similar to that in the United States) to coordinate foreign policy. Previously, the military often kept the foreign ministry in the dark; and the party’s foreign-affairs office, which handled North Korea, often failed to coordinate its activities with the foreign ministry, which handled South Korea. An anti-corruption campaign weakened opposition, and Zhu re-emerged as a hero. This set the stage for Xi’s arrival. In short, the new-style leadership, a form of managed charisma, was collectively designed to serve national needs. And it implies that Xi is unlikely to emerge as paramount leader. The Chinese presidency’s authority has certainly increased; but Xi is powerful only when he has the votes. On contentious issues, he has but one of seven.",
            "中国的习因素 香港—在今年早些时候中国领导层交接之前，专家们纷纷表示中共决意要避免英雄人物掌权。 他们指出，中共希望新领导人更像即将卸任的胡锦涛是一个官僚，而不要像前重庆市委书记薄熙来那样是一个强人。 但新国家主席和中共总书记习近平绝非平庸之辈。 一上任他就前往深圳朝邓小平雕像致意，三十年前，作为前中共领导人的邓小平在深圳拉开了改革的序幕，让顽固的中共接受了自由市场。 在11月的顶层会议中，习近平制定了经济方向根本性变革的细节，光芒盖过了它的同事。 如今，习近平领导的新经济小组将协调他心存不满的同事，实施他的改革。 与胡锦涛不同，习近平马上就成为军队首脑，现在还领导着国家安全委员会。 咋一看，一位“最高领袖 ” （ paramount leader）正在冉冉升起。 近期历史解释了这一权力的再集中。 1993年，中央政府领导人的权力相对有限：他们控制不了货币供给，也很难更换省级领导人或高层军官。 中央政府收入很低；事实上，按比例计算，中国中央政府是主要经济体中规模最小的。 这一状况在时任总书记江泽民和国务院总理朱镕基任上发生了改变，江泽民和朱镕基通过权力集中避免了中国银行风险上升带来的经济危机。 在此过程中，中国国有企业职工人数减少了5 000万，全国减少了2 500万个制造业岗位，中央政府工作人员数量也大幅下降。 这些措施挽救了中国经济，但代价是社会压力的全面增加，也导致朱镕基在离任后非常不受欢迎。 针对朱镕基和江泽民的城市、沿海和市场导向改革的群众反对情绪带来的是从政经历来自内陆省份甘肃和西藏的领导人。 面临对不平等性的怨恨和社会紧张局面的胡锦涛和他的总理温家宝提出了“和谐社会 ” 。 不再强调朱镕基的日程。 他们减缓了经济改革，暂停了政治改革。 官僚人数从4 000万膨胀到7 000万，权力则下放到各省、官僚机构和国有企业。 幸运的是，令人昏昏欲睡的胡温时代并没有让江朱时代实施的改革所开启的经济增长减慢速度。 但江朱改革所形成的经济增长模式正在失去动力。 随着劳动力成本���上升，低成本出口难以为继。 基础设施投资对象不再是城际高速公路等强化增长的项目，变成了生产率更低的二三线城市购物城。 国有企业生产率大幅下降，同时它们优先获得融资的特权又挤出了私人部门投资。 地方政府通过征地和卖地进行融资的做法也已经趋于极限。 于是，实施新一轮深层次改革就变得至关重要，包括利率、证券市场和外汇管制的自由化，这样才能为生产率更高的私人部门提供资金并削减国有企业的过剩产能。 特别地，中国需要改革抑制房地产泡沫。 房地产泡沫的罪魁是找不到其他可盈利投资渠道的巨额储蓄和外国资本流入。 政府计划实施利率和资本账户自由化以鼓励对现代高价值行业的投资，不再继续补贴低价值出口部门。 政府开始将经济的基础从出口导向型行业专项国内增长，从制造业专项服务业。 政府还宣布将抑制地方政府征用农地和通过政府控制企业过度借贷。 毫不奇怪，改革的反对之声不绝于耳。 国有企业决意捍卫它们的特权。 高杠杆的地方政府无法忍受提高利率或货币升值，坚持继续卖地和反对房产税。 它们担心向农民工提供社会服务的新要求所带来的财政负担。 因此一个精干的领导团队必须动员起来。 最高领导层人数从九人减少为七人。 新阵容排除了最强硬的左派（薄熙来 ） ， 而右派“极端改革者 ” （ 李源潮和汪洋）只能位居次等。 为了减少老干部的干扰，胡锦涛卸任军队首脑，江泽民也承诺力挺习近平。 此外，习近平成立了一个经济领导小组迫使官僚屈服，还成立了国家安全委员会（与美国国家安全委员会类似）协调外交政策。 此前，军方常常让外交部无所适从；而中共外事办公室（负责朝鲜事务）往往不能协调其与外交部（负责韩国事务）的行动。 反腐行动减弱了改革的反对力量，朱镕基以英雄形象再次出现在公众视野。 这些都是在为习近平的上台铺路。 简言之，中共集体设计了一种新的领导风格 — — 有管理的领袖形式（managed charisma）来满足国家需要。 这意味着习近平不可能成为最高领袖。 中国国家主席的权威显然增加了，但习近平只有在掌握选票的情况下才能得到权力。 在存在争议的问题上，他只是七人中的一人。"

            "Desperate Women’s Dangerous Moves GENEVA – One of the most significant recent trends in migration has been the rise in the number of women using dangerous routes previously used mainly by men. More and more women – fleeing discrimination, violence, or poverty – are now taking the same risks as men in search of a better life for themselves and their children. This is desperation migration. Indeed, while many women travel with their families, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) is seeing an increasing number of women migrating on their own to an unknown, unpredictable, and often dangerous future. Women and children migrants are dying with increasing frequency at sea, crossing deserts, and on other hazardous routes. What has changed? Among the many factors pushing women to migrate are pervasive gender bias and social prejudices against single mothers or widows in their country of origin. But poverty is almost always the strongest force driving women to leave. In most poor countries, women are poorer than men, owing to the systematic discrimination that they face in education, health care, employment, and control of assets. Of course, most migrant women do not encounter mistreatment or die on their journeys; in fact, many derive real benefits from migration. But, among the world’s estimated 111 million migrant women (half the total), violence and abuse can occur at any time, starting from the very outset of the migration process. Throughout the migration cycle, women are more at risk from physical violence by fellow migrants, smugglers, and state officers, and can be forced to exchange sex for transportation, food, or accommodation. Unsurprisingly, migrant women are often victims of human trafficking, finding themselves enslaved as laborers, prostitutes, or participants in organized begging operations. This is true regardless of why women migrate. When women run for their lives because of natural or man-made disasters, gender-based violence is one of the great risks they face. Displaced women, often destitute, are easy prey for criminals. This was one of my immediate concerns when Typhoon Haiyan struck the Philippines, and at my request a special program was instituted to alert and help women in peril. Even when women migrants find a job in a host country, it is rarely easy for them. They are predominantly employed in domestic work, care-giving, agriculture, and entertainment – all low-paid, largely unregulated sectors that are rarely covered by national labor laws. They are often subject to punishingly long working hours, non-payment of wages, forced confinement, starvation, beating, sexual abuse, and threats and intimidation. Many women migrants are unskilled or undocumented domestic workers. This makes them more vulnerable to violence, because they typically depend on a single employer and in many countries face deportation if they attempt to change jobs. Moreover, social integration in a new country can be more difficult for women than for men. This is partly because women are often subject to harmful traditional practices, such as early and forced marriage, female genital mutilation, and so-called “honor” crimes, enforced by families who want to maintain a link with their country of origin. And it is especially difficult for women migrants to navigate between the tantalizing freedom of choice and expression in their host society and the traditional roles expected of them at home. The rising number of migrant deaths – both women and men – at sea and in deserts is a wake-up call for the international community to act. IOM has called on all relevant actors – including countries of origin, transit countries, and destination countries – to address the plight of migrants attempting life-threatening journeys and find solutions. Protecting women migrants – often the most desperate of the desperate – should top their priorities. In 2014, the international community will review the United Nations Millennium Development Goals, which expire next year, and decide on a post-2015 development agenda. IOM believes that migrants, and in particular women migrants, who in the past have been largely invisible in the language of development, must be a part of this. We must no longer ignore half the world’s migrants. Like all migrants, women on the move are entitled to personal security and basic dignity.",
            "绝望女性的危险运动 日内瓦—当前移民活动的一个重大趋势是越来越多的女性采用了此前主要由男性采用的危险办法。 越来越多的女性为了摆脱歧视、暴力或贫困而甘愿像男性一样冒险为自己和孩子争取更好的生活。 这就是绝望的移民。 事实上，尽管许多女性跟随家庭迁徙，但国际移民组织（IOM）发现独立地为了未知的、不可预测的并且往往是很危险的未来而移民的女性数字正在增加。 女性和儿童移民越来越多地丧生于渡海、穿越沙漠和其他危险途径中。 是什么发生了改变？ 促使女性移民的因素包括原住地无处不在的针对单身母亲或寡妇性别歧视和社会偏见。 但贫困几乎永远是促使女性迁徙的最重要动力。 在大部分穷国，女性比男性更穷，这是因为她们在教育、医疗、就业和资产控制中处于系统性的被歧视地位。 当然，大部分女性移民在迁徙过程中没有遇到虐待或死亡；事实上，许多人因为移民而境况大为改善。 但是，据估计，全世界有1.11亿女性移民（大约占总数的一半 ） ， 而在移民过程中，随时可能发生暴力和虐待，几乎从移民过程的一开始就是如此。 在整个移民过程中，女性更容易受到来自同伴、走私贩和国家官员的人身伤害，并有可能被迫用性换取放行、食物和住宿。 毫不奇怪，女性移民往往是人口贩子的受害者，最后沦为奴役劳工、娼妓、或乞讨集团成员。 这就是事实，不管女性移民原因为何。 当女性因为自然或认为灾难而为生命而迁徙时，基于性别的暴力就成为她们所面临的的一个大威胁。 流离失所的女性往往身无分文，很容易成为犯罪对象。 当海燕台风袭击菲律宾时，我最担心的事情之一也在于此，在我的要求下成立了一个特别计划帮助受灾女性。 即使有女性移民在东道国找到了工作，也决不轻松。 她们大多从事家政、看护、农业和娱乐工作 — — 都是低薪工作，并且往往属于得不到国家劳动法覆盖的不受管制的部门。 她们往往必须承受极长的工作时间、工资克扣、强制监禁、挨饿、挨打、被性虐待，还饱受威胁和恐吓。 许多女性移民是无技能、无合同的家政工人。 这让她们更容易遭到暴力，因为她们往往得依靠单一雇主，并且在许多国家如果试图换工作就要面临遣返。 此外，在新国家融入社会对于女性也比男性更难。 这部分是因为女性通常需要被迫接受伤害性风俗，比如强制性童婚、割礼以及由试图坚守国家传统的家庭强制实施的所谓的“荣誉犯罪 ” 。 女性移民想要在东道国诱人的选择和言论自由和母国期待她们的传统角色之间游刃有余更是难上加难。 死于海中和沙漠中的移民数量 — — 不管是男性还是女性 — — 的上升是警世钟，国际社会应该行动起来。 IOM呼吁相关行动方 — — 包括来源国、中转国和目的国 — — 改变移民尝试有生命危险的旅程的现象并找出解决方案。 保护女性移民 — — 她们通常是绝望者中的绝望者 — — 应该被列为重中之重。 2014年，国际社会将评估明年到期的联合国千年发展目标并决定2015年后的发展日程。 IOM认为，移民，特别是女性移民，应该位列其中，她们过去的发展问题上往往受到忽视。 我们再也不能忽视世界移民人口中的这一半了。 和所有移民一样，运动中的女性有权获得个人安全和基本尊严。"

            "Is Post-Brexit London Really Doomed? EDINBURGH – It is now well over three years since the United Kingdom voted, by a narrow but significant margin, to leave the European Union. Yet we still have no idea what kind of economic relationship the UK will have with the 27 countries it leaves behind. (Some of the debate in London recalls in its insularity the apocryphal 1930s headline: “Fog in Channel: Continent Cut Off.”) Insofar as one can hazard a guess, the most likely outcome seems to be a more remote relationship than “Leave” supporters talked about in the referendum campaign and than most commentators envisaged shortly after the vote. But, despite that change of direction, and the certain loss of the so-called passport, which would allow financial services to be sold freely across the EU, the feared large-scale exodus of firms and financiers from London does not seem to be under way. The French bakeries and German sausage shops are still doing a roaring trade. Why? Two very recent pieces of evidence give a sense of what is happening on the ground, while politicians continue to argue. The accounting firm EY has monitored firms’ declared intentions in response to Brexit over the last three years. The latest survey, published in mid-September, indicates that 40% of firms plan to move some of their operations and staff out of London, while 60% of larger firms have announced such moves. But the number of jobs that are to be moved from London to another European city is now only 7,000, far lower than estimates made a couple of years ago. Interestingly, the two locations that, according to EY, have benefited most so far are Dublin and Luxembourg. That is good news for London, because both are niche centers and unlikely to emerge as powerful rivals across the full spectrum of financial activities. Had Paris and Frankfurt been the principal beneficiaries, the long-term consequences could be far more threatening. Their marketing campaigns are so far yielding only modest returns. There is, however, some more worrying news for London in the survey. Firms confirm that they are likely to move assets out of the UK on a large scale. The latest estimate is that around £1 trillion ($1.2 trillion) of assets under management may move to other centers when the UK leaves the EU. Many employees who are responsible for these assets will remain in London for now, but that could change over time. And a second data point suggests that London’s reputation is beginning to suffer. A consultancy called Z/Yen has published a Global Financial Centres Index every six months for more than a decade. The latest ranking, in mid-September, showed that while London remains second only to New York globally, its relative position has been slipping. New York’s lead has more than doubled in the last six months. London’s relative decline has been sharper than any other of the top centers, and Paris has moved up. Indeed, the gap between London and Paris has fallen to 45 points from 88 points in March (the top mark is just below 800). The European Banking Authority’s move to Paris, and Bank of America’s decision to relocate its euro trading there, are probably the main factors behind that change of perception. Moving from survey to anecdote, managers say they have found it harder than expected to persuade senior staff to move. Even Italians and French who have been asked to relocate back to Milan or Paris are often reluctant to agree. Their children are settled in school, their spouse or partner has a non-mobile job in London, or they can’t bear to find themselves so close again to Mom and Dad! More significantly, perhaps, a global market is a complex ecosystem. The traders may move, but will the IT infrastructure and support be as sophisticated elsewhere as it is in London? Will skilled consultants and lawyers be available on demand, as they are in the Square Mile? These factors are making firms hesitant about large-scale moves. Instead, many have been looking for workarounds to overcome the regulatory problems they will certainly encounter once the UK leaves the single market. Moreover, the politics of Brexit remain fraught and complex, and there is a small chance that the UK will hold another referendum and reverse course, which would render nugatory the £4.2 billion that the government vowed to spend on contingency plans. But the most likely outcome is that the UK stumbles toward the exit and falls untidily over the threshold, without a structural new relationship or a lengthy transition period. Thereafter, we will see how Europe’s financial markets evolve. But the central expectation, given what we have seen so far, must be that Europe will migrate to a multi-polar financial model, with different centers, small and large, exploiting their respective comparative advantages. Dublin and Luxembourg will strengthen their positions, especially in asset management. The European Central Bank will act as a pole of attraction for Frankfurt. Euro-denominated transactions will increasingly take place in the eurozone, while London looks likely to remain, for the foreseeable future, Europe’s window on the wider world. There will be a price to pay for users of financial services, as a dominant single center is almost certainly more efficient and cheaper. But, after Brexit, that solution will no longer be available in London, and there is certainly no consensus among the other 27 countries on a single alternative.",
            "脱欧后的伦敦真的完蛋了吗？ 发自爱丁堡—距英国以微弱但意义重大的票数投票决定脱离欧盟已经过去三年多了。 然而时至今日，我们仍然不知道英国将与它所抛弃的那27个国家建立什么样的经济关系。 （发生在伦敦的一些辩论使人联想起1930年代一条杜撰新闻标题所体现的岛国心态 ： “ 英吉利海峡大雾：欧洲大陆被切掉了 ” 。 ）如果大胆猜测的话，最可能的结局似乎是比“脱欧”支持者在全民公投中讨论过的，也是投票之后不久大多数评论员所能想到的更遥远的关系。 但尽管形势发生了变化，而让金融服务能够在整个欧盟范围内自由出售的所谓通行证确实会打折扣，人们所担心的伦敦企业和金融家大规模外迁却似乎并未发生。 当地的法国面包店和德国香肠店仍在进行激烈的贸易。 究竟是怎么回事？ 在政治家继续争论的同时，有两个新近证据透露出了一点实际情况。 在过去的三年中，安永会计师事务所一直在监​​视企业针对英国脱欧而发布的各类意图。 这项于9月中旬发布的最新调查表明，有40％的企业计划将其部分业务和员工迁出伦敦，而60％的大公司都已经宣布了此类举措。 但如今即将从伦敦转移到另一个欧洲城市的职位数量只有7000个，远低于两年前的估算。 更有趣的是安永表示迄今为止受益最大的两个地方是都柏林和卢森堡。 这对伦敦来说是个好消息，因为它们都是适合开展某类活动的小型中心，不太可能成长为覆盖整个金融活动光谱的强大竞争对手。 如果巴黎和法兰克福是职位迁移的主要受益者，那么长期后果可能更具威胁性。 但迄今为止他们的营销造势活动仅产生了微薄的回报。 但调查中还有更多令伦敦担忧的新闻。 企业确认它们有可能将资产大规模移出英国。 最新的估算是英国脱欧后会有约1万亿英镑（折合1.2万亿美元）的管理资产可能转移到其他中心。 许多负责这些资产的员工将暂时留在伦敦，但时间一长就难免发生变化。 第二个数据点表明伦敦的声誉已经开始受损。 一家名为Z/Yen的顾问公司在过去十多年中每六个月发布一次全球金融中心指数。 在9月中旬发布的最新数据显示，尽管伦敦在全球范围内仅居于纽约之后，但其相对地位一直在下滑。 在过去六个月中，纽约的领先优势翻了一番以上。 伦敦的相对下降幅度比任何其他顶级中心都严重，巴黎也排名也有所上升。 确实，伦敦和巴黎之间的差距已经从3月份的88点下降到45点（最高分数略低于800 ） 。 欧洲银行管理局迁到巴黎，以及美国银行决定将其欧元交易中心转移到巴黎的决定可能是这种观念转变背后的主要因素。 而从调查转到实地走访，企业经理们都发现说服高级职员搬迁要比想象中的难。 即便是那些被要求搬回米兰或巴黎的意大利人和法国人也往往极不情愿 — — 他们的孩子在伦敦的学校上学，配偶或伴侣从事着一些非流动性工作，或者受不了再回到离父母那么近的地方！ 或许更重要之处在于全球市场是一个复杂的生态系统。 金融交易商可能会搬迁，但其他地方的IT基础架构和支持能否像伦敦一样成熟？ 是否像在伦敦金融城一样有高技能的顾问和律师随叫随到？ 这些因素都使企业对大规模搬迁行动犹豫不决。 相反许多企业一直在寻找变通方案以克服英国退出单一市场后肯定会遇到的监管问题。 此外脱欧政治仍然充满变数和复杂性，英国极有可能举行另一次全民公决并逆转整个进程，这将使英国政府誓言要花费在应急计划上的42亿英镑变得微不足道。 但最有可能的结果是英国跌跌撞撞地迈向脱欧，并在越过时间门槛时摔个狗啃泥，既无法构建结构性的新关系也无法争取到较长的过渡期。 在那以后我们将看到欧洲金融市场的走向。 但根据我们目前为止所看到的情况，主要的预期必定是欧洲将转换为一个不同大小规模金融中心各自展现自身比较优势的多极金融模型。 都柏林和卢森堡的地位都将加强，尤其是在资产管理方面。 欧洲中央银行将成为法兰克福的主要卖点。 以欧元计价的交易将越来越多地在欧元区进行，而在可预见的未来，伦敦似乎依然会是欧洲通往更广阔世界的窗口。 金融服务的使用者们为此需要付出一定的代价，因为占主导地位的单一金融中心几乎肯定更加有效和廉价。 但在英国脱欧之后该解决方案将不再由伦敦提供，而其他27个国家对于另一个单一中心替代方案显然也无法达成共识。"

            "Will NATO’s Prodigal Son Return? PARIS -- Few state visits have lasting results. Nicolas Sarkozy’s just completed trip to Washington may be an exception, because the French President may be preparing to bring NATO a highly valued present for its 60th anniversary in the spring of 2009: France’s return to NATO’s integrated military structure, from which Charles de Gaulle withdrew in 1966. In retrospect, de Gaulle’s decision proved to be much more detrimental for France than for the Alliance. By withdrawing from NATO’s integrated military command, France excluded itself from political decision-making within the Alliance and thus became the equivalent of the “Harkis”– the local soldiers who served with the French army during the Algerian war: fine soldiers, but with virtually no reward for their service. How realistic is the possibility of scenario French return to NATO’s military fold? Historically, aborted moves and faux pas abound on both sides in the French/NATO relationship, the latest being Jacques Chirac’s failed attempt to patch up France’s relations with NATO upon his arrival in power in 1995. Success is not guaranteed this time, either, but the chances are much higher now, because France, the United States, and the world have changed. For starters, the US now has a real friend and ally in the Élysée Palace. To speak of Sarkozy as a substitute for Tony Blair in Europe would be premature – and unhelpful, given Blair’s inability to exert significant influence on US policy. But Sarkozy is both eager to transform France’s relations with the Alliance and has a strategy to do so. Moreover, the French army supports such a move, while only a small segment of the Foreign Ministry is opposed. Sarkozy’s strategy is to link progress in building a common European defense and security structure with a redefinition of NATO. More Europe in security terms means more Alliance. So, because Sarkozy wants to be seen as a convinced European, he must normalize France’s relations with a new Alliance based on two pillars – European and American. Moreover, financial and human resources for military affairs are scarce and cannot be duplicated, while France and Britain want to restart the Saint-Malo process of bilateral defense efforts launched nearly ten years ago. As a result, for the sake of Europe, France must move closer to the Alliance. Sarkozy has also fully integrated into France’s approach to Europe a reckoning with the new balance of power within the European Union following the accession of Eastern European states. Unlike Chirac, he understands that it is counterproductive and unrealistic to ask countries like Bulgaria or Romania to choose between their European or Atlantic loyalties. Here, again, strengthening Europe requires strengthening the Alliance. Sarkozy’s approach may work, because America, too, has changed. In American eyes, the Kosovo war in 1999 demonstrated NATO’s glaring and myriad shortcomings, while the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, moved America still further away from the Alliance, particularly after President George W. Bush disparagingly rejected NATO’s offer of help. Former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld even tried to use divide-and-rule tactics by pitting “New” Europe against the “Old” Europe led by France and Germany, which opposed the Iraq war. Those divisions are now history, and American reservations about a European security pillar cannot trump America’s pressing needs for allied support. Confronted with disaster in Iraq, the risk of Afghanistan following Iraq into chaos, and the escalating crisis with Iran, the US can no longer treat the NATO allies with disdain. Although Europe remains militarily weak, America’s power is now in doubt. If a European pillar within NATO is needed to strengthen the Alliance, why not accept it? Beyond the changes in France and the US, the decisive factor behind the possible reinvention of NATO is the transformation of the international system itself. Aside from the explosive situation in the Middle East and the threat of Islamist terrorism, the West is now confronted with the rise of Asia, the return of a more assertive Russia, and new energy and environmental challenges. Both France and America have a key role to play in addressing these issues effectively. Sarkozy’s trip to Washington, and his address to a receptive US Congress, was one more step toward ensuring that they do so together.",
            "法国会重回北约怀抱吗？ 巴黎—很少有国事访问能产生持久的成效。 而萨科齐对华盛顿刚刚进行的访问可能是个例外。 因为这位法国总统可能正准备为北约在2009年春的60周年诞辰献上一份厚礼：法国将重返北约统一军事架构。 在1966年戴高乐执政时期法国退出了北约。 回头看来，戴高乐的决定对法国造成的伤害比对北约造成的更大。 由于退出了北约的统一军事指挥体系，法国将自己排除在该联盟内部的政治决策之外，成为与“Harkis”军人类似的身份—这是些在阿尔及利亚战争中与法国军队并肩战斗的当地军人：勇猛的战士，但却几乎没有因为服役而获得任何犒赏。 法国重返北约军事体系的可能性究竟有多大？ 从法国—北约关系的历史上看，许多类似的举措要么不了了之、要么马失前蹄。 最近的一次失败是希拉克在1995年上台以后企图修补法国与北约关系的努力。 虽然这次也不能保证成功，但机会却很大，因为法国、美国和世界都发生了变化。 首先，美国现在在爱丽舍宫有了一个真正的朋友。 虽然鉴于布莱尔在对美国政策施加重大影响方面的无能，就说萨科齐会在欧洲取代他还言之过早—也于事无补。 但萨科齐不但有转变法国与北约关系的热情，还有相应的战略。 此外，法国军方也支持这一举动，只有外交部的一小部分人反对。 萨科齐的战略是将建立欧洲共同安全与防务架构的进展与对北约的重新定义联系起来。 更安全的欧洲也意味着结盟程度更高的欧洲。 所以，由于萨科齐希望被看作是一个满怀信心的欧洲人，他就必须使法国与新联盟的关系正常化。 新联盟的两大支柱是欧洲人与美国人。 另外，尽管法国和英国想要重新启动近十年前开始实施的双边防务的Saint-Malo进程，但军事的财政和人力资源是稀缺并不可复制的。 所以，为了欧洲，法国必须与北约走得更近。 萨科齐也完全融入了法国对欧洲的策略，在东欧诸国加入欧盟以后承认新的权力平衡。 与希拉克不同，他明白让保加利亚或罗马尼亚这样的国家在对欧盟或北约的忠诚之间做出抉择是不现实的，其后果会适得其反。 这一点再次说明强化欧洲需要巩固北约。 萨科齐的策略可能会行得通，因为美国也改变了。 在美国人的眼中，1999年的科索沃战争反映了北约的种种软肋，而2001年9月11日的恐怖袭击更使得美国与北约渐行渐远，特别是在布什总统轻蔑地拒绝了北约的援助之后。 前防长拉姆斯菲尔德甚至试图采用“分而治之”的办法，在“新”欧洲和法、德领导的，反对伊拉克战争的“老”欧洲之间制造对抗。 这种分化现已成为历史，美国对欧洲安全支柱的迟疑远不如其对盟友支持的需求来得急迫。 面对伊拉克的灾难，阿富汗步其后尘陷入混乱的风险和伊朗危机的升级，美国不能再轻视北约盟国了。 虽然欧洲的军力依然虚弱，但美国的实力也令人怀疑。 如果北约内部需要一个欧洲支柱来强化联盟，为什么不接受呢？ 在法国和美国的变化之外，重塑北约的可能性背后还有一个决定性因素，那就是国际体系本身的变化。 除了中东一触即发的局势和伊斯兰恐怖主义的威胁，西方现在还面临着亚洲的崛起、一个更为自负的俄罗斯和新的能源及环境挑战。 法国和美国在有效应对这些问题方面都要扮演关键性的角色。 萨科齐的华盛顿之行和他受到美国国会欢迎的演讲是确保两国走向合作的第一步。"

            "Bankers with Borders LONDON – When Mark Carney replaces Mervyn King as Governor of the Bank of England in July 2013, the world will be deprived of King’s witty public utterances. My personal favorite came when, commenting on strong retail-sales figures during one Christmas period, he cast doubt on their significance for assessing the state of the economy. “The true meaning of the story of Christmas” he solemnly intoned, “will not be revealed until Easter, or possibly much later.” A new career on the stage, or in the pulpit, surely beckons. King’s most quoted phrase is that “global banking institutions are global in life, but national in death.” They trade globally, across porous borders, attaching little significance to the geographical location of capital and liquidity. But, when the music stops, it is the home regulator, and the home central bank, that picks up the tab, even if the losses were incurred elsewhere. By the same token, a failing bank may leave behind a mess in third countries, which its home authorities may not clean up. Icelandic banks, for example, took deposits in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, and swept them back to Reykjavik, leaving the host countries out of pocket. Likewise, the collapse of Lehman Brothers left European creditors more exposed than those in the US, whose funds had been wired home to New York on the Friday before the end. Regulators have been wrestling with this problem for years, without conspicuous success. In mid-December, the Bank of England (BoE) and the United States Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) announced what seemed like a breakthrough, at least concerning the major banks headquartered in the US or the UK – that is, 12 of the 28 institutions regarded by the Financial Stability Board as globally systemic. In their case, a resolution authority, in London or Washington, would take control of the parent company, remove senior management, and apportion losses to shareholders and unsecured creditors. It sounded plausible. BoE officials declared firmly that they were prepared to trust their American counterparts, and would not step in to grab subsidiaries or assets based in the UK. “This is a journey that involves trust,” said BoE Deputy Governor Paul Tucker. But the Anglo-American love-in quickly soured when the FDIC chairman was asked to give the same assurances of confidence in the British authorities. According to the Financial Times, he “laughingly declined.” Indeed, while the FDIC and the BoE were working on their plan, the US Federal Reserve was developing proposals that will expose overseas banks in the US to a far tighter set of controls, and closer supervision, than they have hitherto experienced. The Fed is seeking to oblige foreign banks to create a holding company to own their separately capitalized subsidiaries, effectively giving the Fed direct oversight of their business. They will also be required to maintain stronger capital and liquidity positions in the US. The justification offered for these new impositions is that overseas banks have moved beyond their traditional lending business to engage in substantial and often complex capital-market activities. “The crisis revealed the resulting risks to US financial stability,” said Fed Governor Daniel Tarullo. The UK’s Financial Services Authority has been invoking the same rationale for requiring foreign banks to establish local subsidiaries, rather than taking deposits or lending through a branch of the parent bank. On the face of it, these moves appear to be well justified, given the mayhem created by poorly regulated banks in the major financial centers. But we should be clear that these changes are not just tinkering at the edges. They amount to a reversal of decades of policy by American and British regulators. Ernest Patrikis, a former Fed supervisor, points to the clear implication that in the US domestic banks will have a strong advantage over foreign banks. More dramatically, he asserts that “subsidiarization would be the end of international banking.” Larry Fink, the CEO of the multinational investment-management firm BlackRock, takes a similar view: “It really throws into question [the] whole globalization of these firms,” with “each country for [itself].” He adds: “I wouldn’t call it a trade war, but I would certainly call it a high level of protectionism.” One delicious irony in Europe is that Chinese banks are contesting the requirement to subsidiarize in London on precisely those grounds. For now, high-octane worries about protectionism are probably overdone. And it is difficult to deny that the Fed should take a close interest in the funding strategies of foreign banks operating in the US. Another Fed governor, Jeremy Stein, has pointed out that foreign banks have dollar liabilities of roughly $8 trillion, much of it short-term wholesale funding. But there is a risk that these interventions are the thin end of a dangerous wedge. Forced subsidiarization causes capital and liquidity to be trapped in local legal entities, reducing the effectiveness with which that capital is used. At a time when bank capital is scarce, that impediment carries significant economic costs. Moreover, tools that may be used wisely and well by institutions with a global outlook, like the Fed and the Bank of England, could take on a different character in countries where a commitment to free and open markets cannot be taken for granted. So we must hope that the US and British authorities move carefully and do not use their new powers to freeze out foreign competition. “Be careful what you wish for” is wise advice in the regulatory world, as it is elsewhere.",
            "有边界的银行家 发自伦敦 — — 等到马克·卡尼（Mark Carney）在2013年7月接替默文·金（Mervyn King）成为英格兰银行行长之后，我们就再也听不到后者诙谐幽默的公开发言了。 我很喜欢他对圣诞期间零售业强劲数据的评论，这些数据对评估经济状况的重要性在他看来都值得怀疑。 “圣诞节的真正意义 ， ” 他严肃地吟诵道 ， “ 要到复活节或更晚之后才能揭示 。 ” （一语双关，暗指耶稣显圣和经济真相的最终昭示都需要时间）可见一份在舞台或圣坛上的新事业会非常适合他。 金被引用得最多的观点是“跨国银行机构因全球而生，却以国家而亡 。 ” 这些机构渗透各国边界进行全球交易，并不在乎资本和流动性的地理位置。 可一旦环境恶化，即使这些损失产生于别处，却是其所在国监管机构和央行为之买单。 同样地，一个破产银行可能会在第三国留下一个烂摊子，但其所在国内当局可能并不会出面收拾残局。 以冰岛各银行为例，它们把英国和荷兰的存款卷回雷克雅未克，却让两国去承担损失。 同样，雷曼兄弟的倒闭将欧洲债权人置于比美国债权人更危险的境地，因为美国人的钱在一切结束前的那个星期五已经被汇回纽约了。 监管机构过去几年一直与这一问题搏斗，却未能取得明显成效。 11月中旬，英格兰银行和美国联邦存款保险公司公布了一个似乎是突破的举措 — — 至少对总部设在美国和英国的大银行而言，也就是被金融稳定委员会视作28个全球系统性机构中的其中12个。 对它们来说，一个在华盛顿或伦敦的解决方案机构将会接管母公司，炒掉高级管理层，把损失摊派给股东和未受保护的债权人。 这听起来似乎可行。 英国央行官员坚称他们已经做好准备相信美国同行，不会插手夺取位于英国的子公司或资产。 英格兰银行副行长保罗·塔克（Paul Tucker）说 ： “ 这是一个包含着信任的过程 。 ” 但是当美国联邦存款保险公司总裁被要求对英国当局作出同样的信心保证时，这场英美之恋立刻变了味。 根据《金融时报》的说法，他“笑着拒绝了 。 ” 事实上，当联���存款保险公司和英格兰银行研究其计划之时，美联储正在研究一种在美外资银行处于比当前更牢固掌控和严密监管之下的提案。 美联储正试图迫使外国银行建立一个控股公司，下属各单独资本化了的子公司，这能有效地让美联储直接监督他们的业务。 这些公司也将会被要求在美国保持更强大的资本和流动性头寸。 这些新规定产生的理由是外资银行已经越过了它们传统的贷款业务，参与到了实质性且通常比较复杂的资本市场活动之中。 “这场危机揭露了由此产生的美国金融稳定风险 ， ” 美联储理事丹尼尔·塔鲁洛（Daniel Tarullo）说到。 英国金融服务管理局已经使用相同的理由来要求外资银行建立当地子公司，而不是通过母公司下属的分公司来进行存款或贷款。 表面看来，考虑到监管不力的银行在全球各主要金融中心引起的混乱，这些举措似乎很合乎情理。 但我们应该清楚这些变化并不是在边缘修修补补。 它们相当于是美国和英国监管机构几十年政策的逆转。 美联储前主管欧内斯特·帕特里基斯（Ernest Patrikis）指出美国国内银行将会比外资银行拥有很强大的优势。 更引人注目地是，他断言“子公司化将是国际银行业的归宿 。 ” 跨国投资管理公司黑石集团的总裁拉里·芬克（Larry Fink）也持有类似的观点 ： “ 这些公司的整个全球化都遭到了质疑，每个国家都是为了自己的利益 ” 。 他补充到 ： “ 我不会把这称之为贸易战，但肯定会将其称之为高层次的保护主义 。 ” 而在欧洲最有趣的讽刺就是中国各大银行恰恰是基于这些理由质疑在伦敦设立子公司的要求。 目前对保护主义政策的强烈担忧或许有些过虑了。 但也难以否认美联储应该更加关注在美外资银行的融资策略。 另一位美联储理事 — — 杰里米·斯坦因（Jeremy Stein）曾指出外资银行有大约8万亿的美元债务，其中大部分是短期的大规模融资。 但是存在着这样一个风险 — — 即这些干预是一个危险的端倪。 强制外资银行设立子公司会导致资本和流动性被困在当地的法律实体里，这降低了资本的有效性。 在银行资本匮乏之时，这种阻碍就将承担着极大的经济成本。 此外，能被具有全球视野的机构 — — 比如美联储和英格兰银行 — — 明智并合理使用的工具在某些国家里可能会呈现不同的特点，因为无法保证这些国家一定会致力于建立自由开放的市场。 所以我们不得不希望美英当局小心行事且不要运用它们的新权力来排斥国外竞争。 “注意你自己的愿望”的忠告不仅适用于别处，对监管者来说也是如此。"

            "Will Next Time Be Different? CHICAGO – Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff, in their excellent, eponymous book on debt crises, argue that the most dangerous words in any language are “This time is different.” Perhaps the next most dangerous words are “Next time will be different.” These words are often uttered when politicians and central banks want to bail out some troubled segment of the economy. “Yes,” one can almost hear them saying, “we understand that bailing out banks will subvert market discipline. But you cannot expect us to stand by and watch the system collapse, causing millions of innocent people to suffer. We have to live with the hand we are dealt. But next time will be different.” They then use every tool they have to prevent economic losses on their watch. The government’s incentives are clear. The public rewards them for dealing with the problem at hand – whether building levees to protect houses built on a flood plain or rescuing banks that have dodgy securities on their balance sheets. Politicians and central bankers gain little by letting the greedy or careless face the full consequences of their actions, for many innocent people would suffer as well. A sympathetic press would amplify their heart-rending stories of lost jobs and homes, making those counseling against intervention appear callous. Democracies are necessarily soft-hearted, whereas markets and nature are not; government inevitably expands to fill the gap. To the extent that the rough justice meted out by markets or nature teaches anyone to behave better, it has consequences far beyond the horizon of anyone in power today. When asked to choose between the risk of being known to posterity as the central banker who let the system collapse and the intangible future benefits of teaching risk takers a lesson, it does not take genius to predict the central banker’s decision. Democracy tends to institutionalize moral hazard in sectors that are economically or politically important, such as finance or real estate, allowing them to privatize gains and socialize losses. Even though the authorities insist that the next time will be different, everyone knows that they will make the same decision when confronted with the same choice again. So, knowing that next time will not be different, the authorities try their best to prevent a “next time.” But risk takers have every incentive to try their luck again, knowing that, at worst, they will be bailed out. In this cat-and-mouse game, risk takers have the upper hand. For one thing, risk takers are typically small, cohesive interest groups that, once rescued, have a powerful incentive, as well as the resources, to buy the political influence needed to ensure a return to the status quo ante. If risk takers were allowed to face more serious losses, they would have fewer resources to fight political attempts to constrain their risky activities. Moreover, the public does not have a long memory, a long time horizon, or an appetite for detail. Even as the United States’ voluminous Dodd-Frank bill tried to ensure that bankers never subjected American taxpayers to undue risk again, public attention had moved on to the state of the real economy and unemployment. Why focus on financial regulation when the risks of an immediate collapse are small, and when the details are so tedious? As technical experts and lobbyists took over, and the public lost interest, Dodd-Frank became friendlier and friendlier to the banks. So how can this one-way betting be stopped? The scary answer may be that it does not end until governments run out of money (as in Ireland) or the public runs out of sympathy (as in Germany vis-à-vis the rest of Europe). To avoid that fate, governments should start by recognizing that the system is programmed to respond to deep distress, and that they can do nothing about it. But they must try to ensure that they do not destroy incentives by doing too much. And they must offset the distortions created by intervention in other ways. For example, the US Federal Reserve has essentially guaranteed the financial sector that if it gets into trouble, ultra-low interest rates will be maintained (at the expense of savers) until the sector recovers. In the early to mid-1990’s, rates were kept low because of banks’ real-estate problems. They were slashed again in 2001 and kept ultra-low after the dot-com bust. And they have been ultra-low since 2008. Senior Fed policymakers deny that their interest-rate policy bears any responsibility for risk taking, but there is much evidence to the contrary. It would be difficult for the Fed to respond differently if the financial sector gets into trouble again. But it does not have to maintain ultra-low interest rates after the crisis has passed, especially if those rates have little impact on generating sustainable economic activity. Doing so merely rewards banks for their past excesses – and taxes savers. More importantly, if the Fed wants to restore incentives for risk takers and savers, it should offset the effects of staying “low for long” in bad times by increasing interest rates more rapidly than is strictly necessary as the economy recovers. This will, of course, be politically difficult, because the public has been programmed to think that ultra-low rates are good, and higher rates bad, for growth, without any consideration for the long-term sustainability of growth. Finally, the pressure on governments to intervene would be lower if individuals had access to a minimum safety net. Official US policy is so activist in downturns (regardless of its effectiveness) partly because unemployment is so costly to workers – who have little savings, unemployment benefits that run out quickly, and health care that is often tied to a job. A stronger safety net for individuals might allow politicians to accept more corporate or financial-sector distress, and help bolster their claim that next time really will be different.",
            "下次会不一样吗？ 发自芝加哥 — — 卡门·莱因哈特与肯尼思·罗格夫这两位经济学家曾合著了一本关于债务危机的大作，书中认为最危险的说辞莫过于“这次跟以前不同了 。 ” 而或许危险程度排名第二的句子则是“下次肯定不会像以往那样 。 ” 每当那些政客和中央银行试图拯救某些陷入麻烦的经济部门时，类似的说辞就会从他们嘴里蹦出来。 人们几乎可以猜到讲话内容 ： “ 我们明白拯救银行会破坏市场纪律，但你也不能让我们眼睁睁看着整个系统崩溃，让数百万无辜民众受苦受难吧，事已至此，也只能硬着头皮去面对了。 不过我保证下次肯定不会像以往那样的 。 ” 然后他们就用尽手中一切手段去制止自己当政期间的一切经济损失。 政府的动机其实相当明确。 公众总会对他们应对当前问题的作为大加赞赏 — — 无论是兴建堤坝保护洪泛区民居还是拯救那些拥有有毒资产的银行。 而倘若政客和中央银行官员们坐视那些始作俑者自食其果的话（这也会导致许多无辜民众受害 ） ， 他们自己却捞不到什么好处。 一个同情心泛滥的媒体将大肆渲染那些失业和无家可归者的辛酸故事，使得那些反对干涉的意见显得残忍且麻木不仁。 民主制度总是心太软，而市场和大自然则太过残酷；于是政府便无可避免地挺身而出，填补了双方之间的空白。 在某种程度上，正是市场和大自然那些粗暴而公正的惩罚教会了人们谨慎行事，同时这些惩罚也会带来超出当权者预料之外的成果。 但倘若要二者选其一：一是作为一个任由系统崩溃的中央银行官员遗臭万年，二是在给那些风险玩家一个教训之后收获不知何时降临的善果，估计很多中央银行家的答案都无法预测。 民主制度倾向于用政策把那些在政治经济上具有重要意义的部门（比如金融或地产）所面临的道德风险包揽起来，让他们一面私有化其收益，另一面却将风险社会化。 即便当局坚称下不为例，所有人都知道他们下次肯定还会做出同样的决定。 因此在明知下一次不会跟以往不同的情况下，政府会想尽办法避免“下一次 ” 。 但那些金融冒险家们肯定有无数借口继续冒险，因为他们知道就算局面最终无法收拾，还是有人会出手拯救他们。 可见在这场猫鼠游戏中，冒险家们无疑占了上风。 首先，这些冒险家属于一个极具凝聚力的小团体，一旦起死回生，他们就有极强的动机（以及资源）去换取所需的政治影响力，好让自己能回复到从前的状况。 如果能让这些人面对更严重损失的话，他们就无法拥有那么多资源去抵抗那些限制其冒险行为的政治行动。 此外，公众往往是健忘，短视而且不关注细节的。 当长篇大论的多德-法兰克法案还在试图确保银行家们不再把美国纳税人置于危险中时，公众的注意力早就转移到了实体经济和就业之上。 在公众眼中既然迅速崩溃的风险已经很小，法律规章的细节又是如此冗长乏味，又何必再着眼于金融管制呢？ 于是技术官员和国会游说者占据了上风，公众又逐渐失去了兴趣，多德-法兰克法案最终也逐渐向银行利益倾斜。 那么这种一面倒的情况何时才是尽头？ 最令人心惊的答案莫过于直到政府都没钱了（爱尔兰那样）或者公众没有了同情心（正如德国人对欧洲其他地区的态度）的那一天。 为了避免这一命运，各国政府应当逐步认识到整个系统早已有了应对深刻危机的一套方法，而且任何人力都无法改变。 但他们必须努力确保不会因为过度作为而损害了市场的内在动力，同时也必须补偿由其他干涉行为而导致的市场扭曲。 比如说，美国联邦储备委员会（简称美联储）就向金融部门保证，一旦后者陷入麻烦就将维持极低利率直到该部门复苏为止。 在1990年代中早期为了解决银行的地产问题而一直压低利率。 随后2001年互联网泡沫爆破，于是利率又再次下滑并维持在极低水平。 如今的低利率已经从2008年维持至今。 美联储高级政策制定者否认自身利率政策对冒险行为负有任何责任，但许多证据却告诉了我们一个相反的事实。 倘若金融部门再度惹祸上身的话，估计美联储的做法还会是老一套。 但它没必要在危机过后继续维持极低利率，尤其是当这些利率对促进可持续经济活动的作用已经很小的时候。 这种做法���仅是便宜了那些曾经过度放肆的银行 — — 还有那些避税的富人。 更重要的是，如果美联储想要恢复冒险者以及储蓄者的动力，就必须停止那在危机时期维持“长期低利率”的做法，转而在复苏时更迅速地升高利率。 这在政治上当然会相当艰难，因为公众早就有了思维定势，认为极低利率肯定好，高利率肯定不好，却根本没有考虑到长期增长的可持续性。 最后，如果民众个人能加入基本的社会安全网络的话，那些要求政府干涉的压力也会得到缓解。 美国官方政策之所以在经济不景时如此活跃，某种程度上就是因为劳动阶层对失业极为敏感 — — 他们没有储蓄，失业救济也很快花光，而医疗往往又和工作挂钩。 一个更强大的个人社会安全网将使得政治家能容许企业和金融部门承担更大的压力，并帮助他们实现“下回真的跟以往不一样”的诺言。"

            "Will Olmert Survive? After Israel’s inability last summer to achieve a conclusive victory over Hezbollah in southern Lebanon, public pressure forced Prime Minister Ehud Olmert’s government to appoint a commission to examine the causes of this surprising failure. How could a small militia, numbering less than a few thousand combatants, survive the onslaught of the Middle East’s most formidable military machine? The commission, headed by retired Supreme Court judge Eliyahu Winograd, has just published its interim report. Its criticism of Olmert, Defense Minister Amir Peretz, and Chief-of-Staff Dan Halutz – set forth in a detailed and meticulous 117-page assessment – is harsh, but not surprising. The Winograd Commission articulated what most Israelis already think: Olmert and Peretz lacked the military, security, and policy experience to confront a terrorist organization that raided Israeli territory, killed a number of soldiers and kidnapped two, and then launched thousands of rockets on civilian targets for over a month. Indeed, the inexperience of the prime minister and the defense minister are unprecedented in Israel’s history. Olmert, who stepped into Ariel Sharon’s shoes as leader of the new Kadima Party, was considered a competent but lackluster parliamentarian – and later mayor of Jerusalem – who was known more for his polemical style than for his political stature or gravitas. For most Israelis, even those who voted for him as the bearer of Sharon’s legacy after the Gaza disengagement, Olmert thus remained the accidental prime minister. Likewise, Peretz, a rabble-rousing but effective trade unionist, surprised all when he won the Labor Party’s leadership primary and then chose the defense portfolio over the treasury. To many, the duo of Olmert and Peretz seemed to invite trouble. Precisely because Israelis are aware of the constant security threat facing their country, they have always believed that their leaders should be able to lead Israel in war – but also to ask the military tough questions when diplomacy may fail. When such a moment arrived, totally out of the blue (or so it seemed) with Hezbollah’s raid on July 12, 2006, Israel’s two top politicians were completely out of their depth, stumbling into a war for which neither they nor the Israeli Army were prepared. The military was led – for the first time in its history – by an Air Force general, Dan Halutz, who believed that everything could be solved by air power, creating a combustible combination of civilian ignorance and military arrogance. In measured but devastating prose, the Winograd Commission gives failing marks to all three leaders. Olmert decided to go into battle recklessly and unaware of the consequences. Peretz was unable to gauge the strategic implications of his decisions. And Halutz failed to present the civilian leadership with the full panoply of military options at the army’s disposal. Halutz already resigned a few months ago. But both Olmert and Peretz have declared that, despite the Commission’s conclusions, they would not quit: instead, they have vowed to implement the report’s many far-reaching substantive recommendations about policy, strategy, and decision-making processes. Will Olmert and Peretz be able to stay on? Their coalition government enjoys a comfortable parliamentary majority; nor does the political arithmetic imply a viable parliamentary alternative. But public opinion – volatile and angry – calls for both to resign: a public-opinion poll conducted after the Commission published its report indicated that only 14% of Israelis believe that Olmert should keep his job, while less than 11% support Peretz. Later this week, demonstrations calling for the government's resignation are planned, and it will become obviously more difficult for the government to continue to function. There are already rumors about a palace coup within Kadima, aimed at replacing Olmert with either the deputy prime minister, the veteran Shimon Peres, or the popular foreign minister, Tzipi Livni. But it does not appear that Olmert will allow himself to be pushed out. In fact, Olmert’s weak and discredited government may yet survive. If the government were to fall and new elections held, there are strong indications that the winner might be Binyamin Netanyahu, of the right-wing Likud, which was decimated in the 2006 elections, but is now patiently waiting in the wings. Many who want Olmert to go would still not welcome a Netanyahu comeback, which may also explain what appears to be an indirect endorsement of Olmert by the United States. Only a strong Israeli government can make the painful decisions necessary for negotiations with the Palestinians to succeed. As a result, the prospects for meaningful continuation of Israeli-Palestinian talks look even dimmer than they did before. Indeed, the real loser of the 2006 Lebanon war was neither Israel nor Hezbollah, but, at least for the time being, the peace process.",
            "奥尔默特能否涉险过关？ 以色列军队去年夏天未能在南黎巴嫩对真主党取得决定性胜利之后，公众压力迫使总理奥尔默特政府任命一个委员会调查这一出人意料的失败的原因。 一个人数不过几千人的小小民兵武装何以能够在中东地区最为强悍的军事机器的扫荡中存活下来？ 由退休的最高法院法官维诺格拉特领导的这一委员会刚刚发表了其临时报告。 这一报告严厉批评奥尔默特、国防部长佩雷茨以及总参谋长哈卢茨，并不出人所料，同时还提出了具体而又精确的长达117页的评估。 维诺格拉特委员会表达了大多数以色列人已经存在的看法，那就是奥尔默特和佩雷茨缺乏军事、安全以及政策经验来面对真主党恐怖组织。 这一恐怖组织袭击以色列领土，杀害数名以色列士兵并且绑架两名士兵，然后又在一个多月的时间里向平民目标发射数以千计的火箭。 确实，总理和国防部长经验不足在以色列历史上是前所未有的。 奥尔默特顶替沙龙成为新组建的前进党领导人，他被认为是一个称职而又没有魅力的议会议员。 他后还作过耶路撒冷市长，其好辩的风格为人所知，要超过其政治地位或实力。 对于大多数以色列人而言，即使他们在加沙地带撤军后投票选举奥尔默特作为沙龙的遗产的继承人，他也只还是一个意外的总理。 同样，佩雷茨是一个有效的工会人士，颇能煽动人心。 当他赢得工党领导人初选后没有选择成为财政部长而选择国防部长的时候，大家都感到惊讶。 对于很多人而言，奥尔默特和佩雷茨这一对组合看起来就会引来麻烦。 正是由于以色列人清楚他们的国家时刻面临安全威胁，他们总是相信，他们的领导人能够在战争中带领以色列，同时，在外交努力失败的时候，他们也能够提出严厉的军事问题。 当这一时刻来临之际，也就是2006年7月12日真主党完全出乎意料地（或者看起来如此）发动袭击的时候，以色列两位最高的政治人物完全不知所措，匆忙之中应战，他们本人以及以色列陆军都没有做好准备。 在历史上第一次，以色列军队由一名空军将军哈卢茨领导。 他相信空中力量可以解决一切问题，从而造成文职领导人的无知以及军队的傲慢。 二者结合就导致局势极度危机。 维诺格拉特报告以克制而又严厉的笔调对所有三位领导人都评定为不及格。 奥尔默特决定仓促作战，不知后果。 佩雷茨无法预测其决定的政治后果。 而哈卢茨则没有向文职领导人提出军队所有的所有军事选择。 哈卢茨已经在几个月前辞职。 但是奥尔默特和佩雷茨二人都宣称，尽管委员会作出了这些结论，他们都不会辞职。 相反，他们发誓要落实该报告提出的许多有关政策、战略以及决策过程的范围广泛的实质性建议。 奥尔默特和佩雷茨能否留任？ 他们的联合政府在议会中占据较大的多数席位。 政治算术也并不表明可以有能够存活下来的其他的议会组成选择。 但是舆论是不定的而又愤怒，要求二人都辞职。 委员会发表其报告后所作的民意调查表明，14％的以色列人相信奥尔默特应当留任，而支持佩雷茨的人不到11 ％ 。 现在已经有人计划在本周晚些时候举行要求政府辞职的游行示威，而这将明显地让政府更加难以继续运作。 现在已经有传言说前进党内部要有宫廷政变，目的在于用副总理、元老佩雷斯或者广受欢迎的外长利夫尼取代奥尔默特。 但是看起来奥尔默特是不会允许然自己被赶走的。 实际上，奥尔默特软弱而又饱受垢病的政府可能还是可以存活下来。 如果政府倒台，举行新的选举，获胜者很有可能是右翼利库德集团的内塔尼亚胡。 该党在2006年的选举中一败涂地，但是现在却耐心等待时机。 许多想要奥尔默特下台的人还是不会欢迎内塔尼亚胡卷土重来，这也就是为何美国间接地支持奥尔默特的原因了。 只有一个强大的以色列政府才能够作出并实施与巴勒斯坦谈判所必要的痛苦决定。 结果，���以会谈有意义地进行下去的前景要比过去看起来还要暗淡。 确实，2006年黎巴嫩战争中真正的失败者既不是以色列也不是真主党，而是中东和平进程，至少目前如此。"

            "Getting Productivism Right CAMBRIDGE – I wrote recently about the possible emergence, from both the left and right of the political spectrum, of a new economic-policy paradigm that could supersede neoliberalism. The new framework gives governments and community organizations greater responsibility to shape investment and production – in support of good jobs, the climate transition, and more secure, resilient societies – and is much more suspicious of markets and large corporations than the outgoing paradigm is. I called it “productivism,” though others can no doubt think of sexier appellations. Throughout history, the pendulum of economic ideology has swung from deification of markets to reliance on the state and then back again. Superficially, we appear to be in the midst of another periodic realignment. It was perhaps inevitable that neoliberalism’s excesses – increased inequality, concentration of corporate power, and neglect of threats to the physical and social environment – would trigger a backlash. But establishing new paradigms requires developing novel approaches, not just emulating the old. When the New Deal and the welfare state replaced the freewheeling capitalism that preceded them, policymakers did not simply revert to former mercantilist practices. They established new regulatory regimes and social-insurance institutions, and embraced explicit macroeconomic management in the form of Keynesianism. Similarly, if productivism is to be successful, it will have to move beyond conventional social protection, industrial policies, and macroeconomic management. It will need to internalize lessons learned from past failures and adapt to fundamentally new challenges. State interventions aimed at reshaping an economy’s structure – so-called industrial policies – have traditionally been faulted for being ineffective and vulnerable to capture by special interests. “Governments cannot pick winners,” as the old adage goes. But much of this criticism is overdone. While there have been notable failures, recent systematic studies find that industrial policies encouraging investment and job creation in disadvantaged regions have often worked surprisingly well. Public-sector initiatives have been behind some of the most impressive high-tech successes of our time, including the internet and GPS. For every Solyndra, the US solar cell manufacturer that failed spectacularly after obtaining $500 million in federal government loan guarantees, there is often a Tesla, the phenomenally successful electric battery and vehicle manufacturer that also received government support at a critical phase of its development. Nevertheless, there is much room for improvement. The most effective industrial policies entail close, collaborative interaction between government agencies and private firms, whereby companies receive critical public inputs – financial support, skilled workers, or technological assistance – in exchange for meeting soft and evolving targets on investment and employment. This kind of industrial policy is likely to work much better – whether in promoting local economic development or directing major national technological efforts – than open-ended subsidies or tax incentives. As the name suggests, productivism focuses on enhancing the productive capabilities of all regions and all segments of society. While traditional forms of social assistance and especially better access to education and health care can help in this regard, connecting people with productive employment opportunities requires improvements on the demand side of the labor market as well as on the supply side. Policies must directly encourage an increase in the quantity and quality of jobs available for the less educated and less skilled members of the workforce, wherever they choose (or can afford) to live. In the future, the bulk of these jobs will come not from manufacturing, but from services such as health care, long-term care, and retail. In the United States, virtually all net new job creation in the private sector since the late 1970s has taken place in services, and less than one in ten workers are currently employed in manufacturing. Even if US policy succeeds in reshoring manufacturing and supply chains, the effect on employment is likely to be limited. The experience of East Asian manufacturing superstars such as South Korea and Taiwan provides a sobering example. While the share of manufacturing value added in GDP (at constant prices) in these two countries has increased rapidly, their manufacturing employment ratios have steadily declined. This observation is important, because much US policy is focused on promoting high-tech manufacturing, including the bill recently passed by Congress that will provide $52 billion in funding for semiconductors and related manufacturing. The initiative is aimed at both enhancing US national security vis-à-vis China and creating good jobs. Unfortunately, even if the first objective is met, the second is likely to remain elusive. A similar point can be made about the subsidies for green technologies that are a core component of the Inflation Reduction Act, which President Joe Biden is likely to sign soon. The green transition is without question an urgent priority that the new paradigm needs to tackle. But here, too, governments cannot kill two birds with one stone. Policies that target climate change are not a substitute for good-job policies, and vice versa. Shoring up the middle class and disseminating the benefits of technology broadly through society requires an explicit good-jobs strategy. Such an approach would not be so fixated on competition with China, would target services instead of manufacturing, and would focus on promoting worker-friendly technologies. It is too soon to tell whether a new productivism paradigm will jell, let alone prove adequate to the tasks at hand. Inflation worries may yet come to dominate policymaking and subordinate structural transformation. Price stability is a sine qua non for the pursuit of productivist economic policies. But a return to orthodox macroeconomic approaches focused on monetary tightening and deficit reduction will leave little fertile ground for policy innovation and experimentation. Ultimately, what economies need is sound ideas, not necessarily a new paradigm. By the time any set of ideas becomes conventional wisdom, it is riddled with one-size-fits-all generalizations and truisms that are bound to be unhelpful and misleading. If the new thinking on productivism is successful, it will eventually be described as a “paradigm,” whether we call it that or not.",
            "正确理解生产主义 坎布里奇—我最近写了一篇可能出现于政治光谱左右两端、可能取代新自由主义的新的经济政策范式的文章。 新框架赋予政府和社区组织更大的责任决定投资和生产 — — 支持好岗位、气候转型和更安全、更有韧性的社会 — — 并且比旧范式更怀疑市场和大公司。 我称之为“生产主义 ” （ productivism ） ， 不过其他人肯定会想到更性感的称呼。 纵观历史，经济意识形态的钟摆从神化市场摆向依赖国家，然后回摆。 从表面上看，我们似乎正处于另一次周期性调整之中。 新自由主义的过度行为 — — 加剧不平等、企业权力集中、忽视对实体和社会环境的威胁 — — 或许难免引发反弹。 但是建立新范式需要开发新的方法，而不仅仅是模仿旧方法。 当罗斯福新政和福利国家取代之前的自由资本主义时，政策制定者并没有简单地恢复以前的重商主义做法。 他们建立了新的监管机制和社会保险机构，采取了凯恩斯主义形式的明确的宏观经济管理。 同样，生产主义要想成功，就必须超越传统的社会保护、产业政策和宏观经济管理。 它需要从过去失败中吸取教训，从适应本质上的新挑战。 旨在重塑经济结构的国家干预 — — 即所谓的产业政策 — — 历来被指为无效且容易被特殊利益集团俘虏。 古谚有云 ， “ 政府挑不出赢家 ” 。 但这种批评大多是过分的。 尽管存在明显的失败，但最新系统性研究发现，鼓励贫困地区投资和创造就业的产业政策往往效果出奇地好。 公共部门的举措是现时代一些令人印象最深刻的高科技成功的背后推手，包括互联网和 GPS。 每一家Solyndra往往都对应着一家特斯拉（Tesla ） 。 前者是一家美国太阳能电池制造商，在获得 5 亿美元的联邦政府贷款担保后惨遭失败，而作为极其成功的电池和汽车制造商的后者，也在其发展的关键阶段获得了政府的支持。 尽管如此，仍有很大的改进空间。 最有效的产业政策需要政府机构和私营企业之间密切合作互动，企业借此获得关键的公共投入 — — 金融支持、技术工人或技术援助 — — 以换取实现投资和就业等软性和不断变化的目标。 这种产业政策可能比开放式补贴或税收优惠更有效 — — 无论是对于促进地方经济发展还是对于引导国家重大技术政策。 顾名思义，生产主义侧重于提高所有地区和社会各阶层的生产力。 传统形式的社会援助，尤其是加强教育和医疗保健的可及性，在这方面有所助益，但将人们与生产性就业机会联系起来需要改善劳动力市场供给端，同样也需要改善劳动力市场的需求端。 政策必须直接鼓励提高受教育程度较低和技能较低的劳动力的岗位数量和质量，无论他们选择（或负担得起）住在哪里。 未来，这些工作的大部分将不是来自制造业，而是来自医疗保健、长期护理和零售等服务业。 在美国，自 1970 年代后期以来，几乎所有私营部门新增就业岗位都发生在服务业，目前只有不到十分之一的工人受雇于制造业。 即使美国政策成功地让制造业和供应链回流，对就业的影响可能也十分有限。 韩国和台湾等东亚制造业巨星的经历提供了一个发人深省的例子。 这两个经济体制造业增加值在 GDP 中的份额（按不变价格计算）迅速增加，但制造业就业率却在稳步下降。 这一观察很重要，因为美国的许多政策都侧重于促进高科技制造业，包括国会最近通过的、为半导体和相关制造业提供 520 亿美元资金的方案。 该法案旨在加强美国面对中国的国家安全，并创造好就业岗位。 不幸的是，即使第一个目标实现了，第二个目标也可能难以实现。 绿色技术补贴亦然，这是拜登总统可能即将签署的《降低通胀法案》的核心部分。 毫无疑问，绿色转型当然是新范式需要解决的当务之急。 但是在这里，政府无法一石二鸟。 针对气候变化的政策不能替代好就业的政策，反之亦然。 支持中产阶级，让科技的收益遍布整个社会需要一个明确的好就业战略。 这一方针不会那么专注于与中国的竞争，目标将是服务业而不是制造业，并将专注于推广对工人友好的技术。 现在判断新生产主义范式是否会成功还为时过早，更不用说证明足以应对当前的任务了。 通胀担忧可能仍会主导政策制定和随之而来的结构转型。 价格稳定是追求生产主义经济政策的必要条件。 但回归以货币紧缩和减少赤字为重点的正统宏观经济方针将不会为政策创新和试验留下多少沃土。 说到底，经济需要的是合理的想法，而未必是新的范式。 当任何一套想法成为传统智慧时，就会充斥万能的概括和不言自明，必然流于无益和误导。 如果关于生产主义的新思维成功，不管我们是否称其为“范式 ” ， 它最终都会被描述为一种“范式 ” 。"

            "Europe’s “Hamiltonian Moment” or “Fort Sumter Fusillade”? LONDON – The Franco-German proposal for a €500 billion ($565 billion) European Union recovery fund to cope with the COVID-19 crisis has been called the EU’s “Hamiltonian moment.” Like Alexander Hamilton’s 1790 agreement with Thomas Jefferson on transferring US states’ Revolutionary War debts to the new federal government, the logic goes, such a fund would pave the way to a United States of Europe. If only it were that simple. A credible federal fiscal capacity, as Hamilton negotiated for the fledgling US, would ensure the euro’s long-term survival. But before Europe achieves anything close to federalism, it must survive a potential “Fort Sumter” moment – that is, a backlash comparable to the 1861 attack by Confederates on a Union garrison near Charleston, South Carolina. The Battle of Fort Sumter marked the start of the American Civil War. Can the EU do better? Until now, COVID-19 has delivered a largely symmetric economic shock to EU member states, with most countries imposing lockdowns of similar intensity and duration. Yet policy responses have been highly asymmetric, with Germany’s fiscal-stimulus plans dwarfing those of southern Europe’s heavily indebted countries. Germany will offer direct fiscal support amounting to 13% of its 2019 GDP – over ten times what Italy is providing. Add to that loan guarantees and tax deferrals, and Germany is delivering support worth a whopping 50% of GDP – four times the amount of economic support on offer in Spain. Without shared fiscal capacity, only the European Central Bank stands between highly indebted member states and skyrocketing borrowing costs. But the need to undertake large-scale bond purchases clashes with the sensibilities of northern European countries, and has spurred accusations that the ECB is exceeding its mandate. Last month, Germany’s Federal Constitutional Court (GCC) ruled that, unless the ECB can prove that the bond-buying program’s policy objectives are “not disproportionate” to their “economic and fiscal policy effects,” it will bar the Bundesbank from participating. The oft-heard Brussels quip, “European law is superior to national law, but German law is superior to European law,” has never seemed more apt. But if the GCC fired the first shots, the European Commission, the ECB, and the European Court of Justice (ECJ) are set to go nuclear, despite the potential for mutually assured destruction. For starters, the ECB Governing Council is expected to instruct the Bundesbank to purchase German bonds anyway – a decision with which the Bundesbank would have to comply, per the EU treaties. If the German government (or the Bundesbank) obeys the GCC anyway, the European Commission may bring a lawsuit against it. The ECB could also decide to circumvent the Bundesbank, purchasing German bonds directly. After all, in monetary unions, the power lies with whoever prints the money, and in the eurozone, that is the ECB. How this conflict will unfold remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: the GCC ruling sets a dangerous precedent. If it is allowed to stand, other national courts could start to cherry-pick EU laws, leading to the collapse of the eurozone, the single market, and the EU itself. Needless to say, German Chancellor Angela Merkel now faces a serious dilemma: challenging the highly respected GCC is politically risky, but acquiescing to its ruling could be catastrophic. It does not help that, with US President Donald Trump committed to his “America First” isolationism, and a post-Brexit Britain apparently eager to sever its remaining ties with the EU, Germany has lost previously reliable strategic allies. Meanwhile, rapidly deteriorating external conditions are threatening the country’s export-led growth model. For the sake of its economic and national security, Germany should be looking to restart the Franco-German motor of integration, not undermining European solidarity. That is where the proposed EU recovery fund comes in: it can obviate the constitutional crisis that would ensue if Germany doubled down on its challenge to ECB policy and the ECJ’s jurisdiction. One thing the COVID-19 crisis has made clear is that Germany’s flawed vision for the euro has become untenable. The eurozone can no longer limp along without fiscal underpinnings, and the misguided obsession with “states’ rights” can no longer dominate national politics and fiscal policymaking. Even former German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble, a longtime advocate of the “states’ rights” approach, is beginning to recognize this. Expressing his support for the EU recovery fund, he declared that, “If Europe wants to have any chance at all, it must now show solidarity.” Europe could have used this perspective during the eurozone crisis of 2011-12. At that time, though, Schäuble pushed strict fiscal austerity, which raised the need for ever-greater monetary accommodation and fueled rising inequality. Had Schäuble instead recognized, as he does now, that “Germans have an overarching self-interest” in Europe’s recovery, and supported appropriate policies, Europe would have weathered the crisis far better. There may not have been an upsurge in nationalism in France, Hungary, Italy, and Poland. Even Brexit may have been averted. Still, better late than never. Yet some still have not learned this lesson. The EU’s so-called Frugal Four (Austria, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Sweden) have issued a counterproposal that would strip the recovery fund of its two most important features. First, they would require that support take the form of loans, instead of grants. Second, they would base allocation on conditionality, rather than need. This version would cause debt to skyrocket in the EU’s most fiscally fragile countries, leaving the ECB, yet again, as the only line of defense against speculative attacks. Central European populists also insist on extracting a pound of flesh, in exchange for agreeing to the recovery fund, which requires unanimous support. Given this, it is worth considering making the initiative a eurozone fund. Countries outside the monetary union – including two of the Frugal Four – could opt in, but they could not block its implementation. Would this enable the EU to avoid a Fort Sumter moment? Maybe. But the GCC could also deem the recovery fund illegal. In that case, the path to disunion would grow shorter.",
            "欧洲：合众还是分裂？ 伦敦—法国和德国提议向欧盟提供5000亿欧元(5650亿美元)的“复苏基金 ” ， 以应对2019冠状病毒病危机，这被称为欧盟的“汉密尔顿时刻 ” 。 正如亚历山大·汉密尔顿(Alexander Hamilton)与托马斯·杰斐逊(Thomas Jefferson)在1790年达成协议，将美国各州的革命战争债务移交给新的联邦政府一样，这笔资金理论上将为建立一个“欧罗巴合众国”铺平道路，要是有那么简单就好了。 正如当时汉密尔顿（Hamilton）为新建立的美国而谈判的那样，一个可信的联邦财政能力，将确保欧元的长期生存。 但在欧洲出现任何联邦制的踪影之前，它必须经受住潜在的“萨姆特堡 ” ( Fort Sumter)时刻 — — 也就是说，一种类似于1861年南方联盟军袭击南卡罗来纳查尔斯顿(Charleston)附近联邦驻军的强烈反弹。 萨姆特堡战役标志着美国内战的开始。 而欧盟能做得更好吗? 到目前为止，2019冠状病毒病对欧盟成员国的经济冲击在很大程度上是对称的，大多数国家实行的封锁程度和持续时间都差不多。 然而，政策回应一直高度不对称，德国的财政刺激计划令南欧负债累累的国家相形见绌。 德国将提供相当于其2019年GDP 13%的直接财政支持 — — 是意大利提供的10倍多。 再加上贷款担保和税收延期，德国提供的支持金额高达其GDP的50 % — —是西班牙提供的经济支持金额的4倍。 在没有共同财政能力的情况下，只有欧洲央行(European Central Bank)在债台高筑的成员国和飙升的借贷成本之间徘徊。 但大规模购买债券的需求与北欧国家的敏感相互矛盾，这引发了对于欧洲央行越权的指责。 上个月，德国联邦宪法法院(GCC)裁决，除非欧洲央行能够证明债券购买计划的政策目标与其“经济和财政政策效果”并没有“不相称 ” ， 否则将禁止德国央行参与。 布鲁塞尔有句常听到的俏皮话 : “ 欧洲法律优于本国法律，但德国法律优于欧洲法律 。 ” 这句话用在此时最为恰当。 但是，如果德国联邦宪法法院（GCC）开了第一枪，欧盟委员会（the European Commission ） 、 欧洲央行（ECB）和欧洲法院(ECJ)就会选择全力反击，尽管一定会两败俱伤。 首先，欧洲央行管理委员会预计将指示德国央行购买德国债券 — — 根据欧盟条约，德国央行必须遵守这一决定。 如果德国政府(或德国央行)无论如何遵守德国联邦宪法法院(GCC)的裁决，欧盟委员会可能会对其提起诉讼。 欧洲央行还可以绕过德国央行，直接购买德国债券。 毕竟，在货币联盟中，谁印钱谁就有权力，而在欧元区，这一权力属于欧洲央行。 这场冲突将如何展开还有待观察，但有一件事是明确的：德国联邦宪法法院(GCC)的裁决开了一个危险的先例。 如果这个裁决真的站住脚，那么其他国家的法院可能会开始挑拣符合自己利益的欧盟法律，导致欧元区、单一市场和欧盟本身的崩溃。 不用说，德国总理安格拉•默克尔(Angela Merkel)现在面临着一个严重的两难境地：挑战备受尊敬的德国联邦宪法法院(GCC)在有政治风险，但默许其裁定可能是灾难性的。 美国总统唐纳德·特朗普(Donald Trump)承诺奉行“美国优先”的孤立主义，而英国脱欧后显然急于切断与欧盟剩余的联系，德国失去了此前可靠的战略盟友。 与此同时，迅速恶化的外部环境正在威胁德国的出口拉动型增长模式。 为了经济安全和国家安全，德国应该重新开始法德联盟以推动一体化，而不是破坏欧洲的团结。 这就是提议中的欧盟复苏基金的作用所在：如果德国加倍挑战欧洲央行的政策和欧洲法院的管辖权，它可以避免随之而来的宪法危机。 2019冠状病毒病危机清楚地表明，德国对欧元有缺陷的设想已经站不住脚了。 没有财政支持，欧元区就不能再蹒跚前行，对“国家权利”的错误痴迷也不能再主导国家政治和财政政策制定。 就连长期倡导“国家权利”的德国前财政部长沃尔夫冈•朔伊布勒(Wolfgang Schäuble)也开始认识到这一点。 在表达对欧盟复兴基金的支持时，他表示 ， “ 如果欧洲想要抓住机遇，现在就必须表现出团结一致 。 ” 在2011-2012年的欧元区危机期间，欧洲本可以奉行这一观点。 不过，当时朔伊布勒推行了严格的财政紧缩政策，这增加了对更宽松货币政策的需求，加剧了不平等。 如果朔伊布勒早点像现在这样认识到，在欧洲的复苏过程中 ， “ 德国人有着十分重要的自身利益 ” ， 并支持适当的政策，欧洲就会更好地度过这场危机。 在法国、匈牙利、意大利和波兰可能没有高涨的民族主义，甚至英国也不会脱欧。 不过，亡羊补牢，尚未晚也。 然而，有些人仍然没有吸取这个教训。 欧盟所谓的“节俭四国 ” ( 奥地利、丹麦、荷兰和瑞典)已经发布了一项反提案，该提案将剥夺复苏基金的两个最重要的特征。 首先，它们要求以贷款的形式提供支持，而不是直接拨款。 其次，它们将根据条件而非需求来分配资金。 这一版本将导致欧盟财政最脆弱国家的债务飙升，让欧洲央行再次成为抵御投机攻击的唯一防线。 中欧的民粹主义者还坚持愿意为换取同意建立复苏基金而付出代价，这需要得到一致的支持。 有鉴于此，有必要考虑将该倡议变成欧元区内部的基金。 欧元区以外的国家(包括“节俭四国”中的两个国家)可以选择加入欧元区，但它们无法阻止该计划的实施。 这能让欧盟避免萨姆特堡(Fort Sumter)危机吗? 也许吧。 但也可能德国联邦宪法法院(GCC)认为“复苏基金”是非法的。 在这种情况下，分裂就已经不远了。"

            "Will Rising Interest Rates Torpedo Stock and House Prices? Interest rates around the world are poised to rise. Short-term rates have gone so low since the worldwide recession of 2001 - 1% and 2%, respectively, in the United States and the Eurozone, and practically zero in Japan - that a strengthening world economy will force central banks to tighten the monetary reins. Australia's central bank has already been raising rates since May 2002, and Great Britain's since November 2003. In the US, the two-day Federal Open Market Committee meeting on June 29-30 is likely to mark a major turning point, reversing the steady decline of the benchmark federal funds rate since Alan Greenspan began loosening monetary policy in 2001. This is likely to be followed by rate increases in China, the Eurozone, and elsewhere. Given the tendency of central banks to change interest rates gradually, any change of direction likely means more changes in the same direction later. What will this landmark change mean for prices of such assets as stocks and homes? In theory, when interest rates go up, there is reason to believe that asset prices will go down. The higher interest rates go, the better are investments in bonds, which compete with investments in other assets such as stocks or homes. Higher interest rates also raise the cost of borrowing to buy these assets, which may diminish demand for them, exerting downward pressure on their prices. When interest rates fall, the opposite effect on asset prices may be predicted. In fact, the history of the stock market's reactions to changing interest rates is mixed. Sometimes interest rate changes have the predicted effect, sometimes they don't. For example, the NASDAQ stock price index made a spectacular 14% jump upwards on the day (January 3, 2001) when America's Fed began its latest series of interest rate cuts. A jump in the market is what one might have expected. But then the NASDAQ index fell 22% over the following year, although the Fed continued to cut interest rates aggressively. Does that experience suggest that the NASDAQ index will drop sharply if the Fed raises interest rates on June 30? No. The timing of the 2001 rate decrease stunned the market. By contrast, the Fed is widely expected to raise rates at the end this month, so there will be no surprise element. The market may know, not just from the experience of 2001-2, that interest rate movements do not have predictable effects on stock prices. But, there are reasons to believe that higher interest rates, even though expected, can have a negative impact on home prices. That is because home buyers are mostly ordinary people with little financial sophistication, unlike the professionals who trade in stocks. Untrained people with other things on their minds can make serious economic errors. Home values have soared to high levels in many countries as irrational exuberance grips the markets. High home prices are already putting great stress on many families, which are struggling to make their mortgage payments. When interest rates go up, these payments will (when the rate is variable) also go up, possibly becoming unsustainable. If one borrows the equivalent of three years' income to buy a house, a mortgage rate of 6% means that 18% of one's income goes to interest payments, which may be tolerable. But if the rate rises to 8%, mortgage interest payments rise to 24%, which, together with amortization, taxes, other debts, and necessary expenditures, may claim too much of the family budget. Some will then try to sell their overpriced homes, and the resulting market imbalance will cause prices to fall. People with fixed-rate mortgages are also vulnerable to rate increases, though less directly. This is because if they have to move and sell their house, there may be no buyers who can afford higher interest payments, unless the home's price also falls. By contrast, sophisticated investors, such as big stock market players, are unlikely to fall prey to this trap. But homebuyers are not as savvy, so they may not see the change coming or they may fail to plan for it. As psychologists have shown, people are susceptible to \"wishful thinking bias,\" wishing away possible future problems that they would rather not think about. They may overemphasize the likelihood of economic success (\"I will be making a lot more money in a few years\") and underemphasize the commonplace problems that regularly challenge family budgets (\"I will be losing my job or getting a divorce\"). This blithe attitude is ultimately behind real estate bubbles where they are occurring. Low interest rates did not cause the bubbles. They only made it easier for people, in those areas of the world where there is a half-believable story about a fabulous future economy, to indulge their fantasies. Interest rate increases will deliver a fresh dose of reality: the interest expense of owning a home is going to claim a larger share of family budgets, a hard fact that will eventually sink into our thinking. But declines in home prices will not occur quickly when central banks begin to raise interest rates. After two years of rate increases, Australia's home price boom only recently shows signs of abating. Dominated by amateur investors, home markets do not turn on a dime. In places where home prices have been rising rapidly, the upward trend may continue or level off for a while. In most high-priced places, a real decline may not come for some time.",
            "利率上升会危及股价和房价吗？ 世界范围内的银行利率都呈上升之势。 短期利率自2001年世界经济不景气以来已降到如此之低-美国和欧元区的利率分别为1%和2 % ， 日本的利率几乎为零-以至于正在走强的世界经济会迫使各国央行收紧货币政策。 澳大利亚中央银行自2002年5月以来就一直在调高利率，英国自2003年11月以来也一直在这么做。 在美国，即将于6月29-30日召开的联邦开放市场委员会会议可能会标志一个重要的转折点。 它会扭转自格林斯潘2001年放松货币政策以来基准联邦基金利率持续降低的趋势。 这有可能进一步带动中国、欧元区和其它地区调高利率。 由于各国央行通常会逐渐调整利率，所以某一大方向上的调整往往意味着一种持续而来的趋势。 这一重大调整对诸如股票和住房一类的资产又意味着什么呢？ 从理论上讲，当利率提高时，人们就有理由相信资产价格会走低。 利率越高，债券的投资行情就越被看好。 投资债券与投资股票和房产是一种竞争的关系。 更高的利率还会使用于购买这些资产的贷款成本增加。 增加的贷款成本可能会减少人们对这些资产的需求，并给这些资产施加降价的压力。 而当利率调低时，人们就能预测其会对资产价格产生相反的作用。 从实际上看，股票市场对利率变化的反应是混合的。 有时利率变化会带来人们意料之中的影响，而有时却不尽然。 例如，在美联储开始其最近的一系列降息的那一天（2001年1月3日）纳斯达克股价指数暴涨14 % 。 股价急升也许是人们意料之中的。 可虽然美联储继续大幅调低利率，纳斯达克指数在次年却下滑了22 % 。 根据以往的经验，纳斯达克指数会在美联储6月30日调高利率之后急剧下滑吗？ 答案是否定的。 2001年的降息让市场措手不及。 相比之下，美联储在这个月底调高利率已在人们的意料之中，所以其中不存在突然性的元素。 市场可能会明白（不光从2001-2的经验当中）利率的波动对股价的影响是不可预测的。 但人们却有理由相信较高的利率，即便在人们的预料之中，也能对房价产生负面影响。 这是因为与从事股票交易的专业人士不同，购房者大都是不谙金融之道的普通人。 怀有其它顾虑的非专业人士可能会犯严重的经济错误。 由于市场被非理性的繁荣所控制，���多国家的房地产都已大幅增值。 高昂的房价已经给很多正艰难地偿还按揭贷款的家庭增加了巨大的压力。 当利率增加时，还款额也会增加（在可变利率的情况下 ） ， 并可能变得难以负担。 如果某人以6%的按揭利率贷了相当于其三年总收入的购房款，这就意味着其收入的18%将会用于偿还利息，这样的负担也许还能承受。 但如果利率上升至8 % ， 按揭还款利息的比例就会上升到24 % ， 再加上分期付款、杂税、其它债务和必要支出，这样的负担可能就会超出一个家庭的还款能力。 在此情况下，有些人可能就会出售其标价过高的住房，由此带来的市场不平衡就会导致房价下跌。 办理了固定利率按揭贷款的人同样容易受利率上升的影响，只不过这种影响不那么直接罢了。 这是因为如果他们不得不搬迁并出售住房，却可能没有买家能够负担得起更高的利息，除非房价也下跌。 相比之下，如股市大户一类的久经世故的投资者就不大容易跌入这样的陷阱。 但购房者却没有那么精明，所以他们要么可能会发现不了即将到来的市场变化，要么可能会没有做好应对措施。 心理学家们指出许多人都容易罹患\"妄想偏见 \" ， 不愿设想自己所不愿考虑但却极可能发生的事。 他们可能会过度强调经济成功的可能性 （ \" 我会在未来几年赚很多钱 \" ） 但却对时时威胁家庭预算的问题考虑不足 （ \" 我会失业或离婚 \" ） 。 正是这种盲目乐观的态度造成了房地产泡沫的出现。 低银行利率并没有造成泡沫。 低利率只是让那些生活在经济前景仿佛一片光明的地区的人们更容易沉浸在他们的幻想之中。 利率的上升会让他们面对现实：购房的贷款利息将会占家庭预算的更大一部分，这是我们最终必须面对的严峻现实。 但房价下跌不会在各国央行开始调高利率之后很快出现。 在利率上升的两年之后，澳大利亚住房价格上涨的趋势才出现缓和迹象。 在业余投资者的主导下，房屋市场对利率变化并不敏感。 在房价上涨过快的地方，这种上升趋势会在一段时间内保持或趋缓。 在大多数高房价地区，真正的房价下跌可能要在相当一段时间之后才会出现。"

            "Will Russia Save the West? MOSCOW – Rapid changes in the global economy and international politics are raising, once more, an eternal issue in Russia: the country’s relations with Europe, and with the Euro-Atlantic region as a whole. Of course, Russia partly belongs to this region. Yet it cannot and does not want to join the West wholeheartedly – at least not yet. Meanwhile, this choice looks very different now compared to just a few years ago. It is becoming obvious that the Euro-Atlantic world, whose economic and political model seemed so triumphant 20 years ago, is now lagging somewhat behind China and other Asian countries. So is Russia, where, despite encouraging talk about innovation-based development, the economy continues to de-modernize as corruption has been allowed to metastasize, and as the country relies increasingly on its natural-resource wealth. Indeed, it is Asia that has turned out to be the true winner of the Cold War. These rising powers raise problems regarding Russia’s geo-strategic choices. For the first time in decades, the values gap between Russia and the EU appears to be increasing. Europe is overcoming state nationalism, while Russia is building a nation state. Broken by history and not wishing to be ravaged by war again, Europeans have embraced compromise and renounced the direct use of force in international relations. Russians, on the other hand, emphasize their “hard power,” including military force, because they know that they live in a dangerous world and have no one to hide behind. And, because of the country’s comparative lack of “soft power” – social, cultural, and economic attractiveness – it stands ready to use the competitive advantages (i.e., its resource wealth) available to it. Internal political developments in Russia are also pushing the country in a different direction from the West. Quite simply, Russia is moving away from democracy. This emerging values gap is not an insurmountable obstacle to geostrategic rapprochement. But, coupled with mutual irritation, which is particularly strong in Russia, closing the gap is becoming much harder. For, while Russia’s elite never considered itself defeated in the Cold War, the West essentially treated Russia as a defeated country – an attitude symbolized by NATO’s eastward expansion, which laid a deep foundation for ongoing tension. It was only after the West encountered an armed rebuff in South Ossetia that NATO expansion was stopped in its tracks. Yet NATO has not given up on further enlargement. NATO expansion is nothing more than the extension of its zone of influence – and in the most sensitive, military-political sphere. And yet the West’s unwillingness to abandon that effort is coupled with a repeated refusal to recognize Russia’s right to have its own zone of interest. So NATO expansion has left the Cold War unfinished. The ideological and military confrontation that underlay it is gone, but the geopolitical rivalry that it entailed has returned to the fore. Thus, the old mentality survived on both sides. Energy debates are another example of this. Non-Russian Europe should thank the Almighty for the presence of energy-rich Russia at its borders, while Russia should be thankful for having such wealthy customers. But the natural differences in the interests of energy consumers and producers have been given a political/security twist – witness the discussions about an “Energy NATO.” Faced with the impossibility of advantageous accession to Euro-Atlantic institutions, Russia is drifting fast towards alignment with China – a “younger brother,” though a respected one. Russia’s “Asian choice” of today is not the same as the Slavophile/Eurasian choice of the past. On the surface, it looks like a choice in favor of a rapidly rising civilization. But the current estrangement from Europe – the cradle of Russian civilization and modernization – threatens Russia’s identity and will increase its geostrategic risks in the future. The United States also loses. Without Russia, which will remain the world’s third strongest power for the foreseeable future, it is impossible to solve the key problems of international security. The current Euro-Atlantic security architecture seems to suit the majority of Americans and Europeans, though it is becoming increasingly fragile and counterproductive.So Russia will struggle to create a new architecture largely on its own – whether through a new treaty on collective European security, or even through its accession to NATO. This is not only in Russian political and civilizational interest, but it also reflects our duty to the entire community of Euro-Atlantic nations, which is being weakened by the “unfinished Cold War.” The idea of a “Union of Europe” between Russia and the EU should be put on the long-term agenda. That Union should be based on a common human, economic, and energy space. The combination of a new security arrangement for the Euro-Atlantic community and the establishment of the Union of Europe could arrest the decline in the international weight of the West.",
            "俄国将会拯救西方？ 莫斯科 — — 全球经济与国际政治的快速变革，使得一个永恒的话题又一次在俄罗斯被人提起，这便是俄国与欧洲以及整个“欧洲-大西洋地区”之间的关系问题。 当然，俄国也部分属于这一地区；但至少迄今为止，该国既无法、也不愿全心全意地加入西方。 同时，与短短几年前相比，这一选择如今看上去已经发生了很大的改变。 欧洲-大西洋世界的经济与政治模式在二十年前看上去大获成功，但它如今已稍稍落后于中国以及其他亚洲国家，这种颓势正变得日益明显。 俄罗斯同样如此，尽管不乏鼓舞人心的言论（如建立在创新基础上的发展 ） ， 但随着贪腐弊病被允许向着各处蔓延、加上该国愈加依赖于自然资源这一财富，如今的俄罗斯经济之现代化程度正在继续下降。 的确，亚洲已证明自己才是冷战的真正胜利者。 这些崛起中的大国，为俄罗斯的地缘战略抉择带来了问题。 数十年来头一回，俄国与欧盟之间的价值隔阂看起来正在加大。 欧洲正在克服国家民族主义，而俄罗斯却在构建一个民族国家。 为历史恩怨搅得身心俱疲、且不愿再受战争之苦的欧洲人，已经接受了妥协这种方式，并放弃了在国际关系中对武力的直接使用。 而俄国人正好相反，他们继续强调包括军事力量在内的“硬实力 ” ， 因为他们明白：自己身处一个危机四伏的世界之中，且没有靠山可供求助。 而且，由于该国社会、文化以及经济方面的吸引力等“软实力”相对缺乏，它只得做好准备，将其竞争力高的现有优势（比如其资源领域的财富）加以应用。 俄国国内政治的发展也使该国与西方渐行渐远。 道理很简单，俄罗斯正在远离民主制度。 对于地缘战略层面的和解而言，这一逐步浮现的价值隔阂并非一道不可逾越的鸿沟。 但与之相伴的还有俄国与西方的相互刺激（这一点在俄国尤为强烈 ） ， 这使得消除隔阂的难度增大了许多。 因为尽管俄国精英从未认为自己在冷战中落败，但西方的做法从本质上说，就是在以对待战败国的方式对待俄罗斯；而北约东扩便是这种态度的典型表现，这一做法为目前的紧张状态埋下了很深的伏笔。 直到西方在南奥赛梯地区遭遇到武力抵制之后，北约东扩的脚步方才停下。 然而，北约仍未放弃进一步的扩张。 北约东扩其实就是自身势力范围的扩张（这还是在最为敏感的军事与政治领域 ） 。 而且西方在不愿放弃扩张努力的同时，还三番五次地拒绝承认俄罗斯也有获得其自身利益范围的权利。 因此，北约东扩使得冷战仍未结束；作为冷战基础的意识形态与军事对抗已然不见踪影，但随之而来的地缘政治竞争却重返舞台中央。 这样，传统思维在俄国与西方都重现生机。 能源争论则是另一个例证。 俄国以外的欧洲应该感谢上帝，因为后者安排能源丰富的俄罗斯与它为邻；而俄国也应为拥有这样一批富有的主顾而心存感激。 但能源消费者与生产者之间利益的天然分歧，又被打上了政治与安全方面的色彩，于是便出现了关于“能源北约”的讨论。 俄国在眼见无望以有利条件加入欧洲-大西洋机制后，便向着与中国这个“小兄弟 ” （ 不过却是一个令人敬重的后辈）结盟的方向快速转变。 如今，俄国的“亚洲选择”已不同于往日那种斯拉夫主义/欧亚主义之选择。 从表面上看，这似乎是一个有利于快速崛起之文明的选择，但当前俄国与欧洲（这是俄国文明与现代化的摇篮）的疏离，却对前者的身份产生了威胁，并会增加其未来的地缘战略风险。 欧洲也不会从这一疏离中获益，它将继续其优雅的衰败过程 — — 威尼斯便是很好的例子；美国同样未能幸免，它若失去了在可预见的未来中、继续身为全球第三强国的俄罗斯之协助，也将无法解决国际安全领域的关键问题。 当前的欧洲-大西洋安全体系，尽管正变得日渐脆弱，其效果也愈加事与愿违，但看起来它却仍令大部分美欧人士中意。 因此，俄罗斯将主要依靠自己的力量，努力创建出一个新的体系 — — 无论是通过欧洲集体安全方面的新条约，还是甚至通过加入北约。 这不单符合俄国的政治与文明利益，也反映出我们对于整个欧洲-大西洋诸国共同体的义务，后者正被“尚未完结的冷战”所削弱。 而在俄国与欧盟之间建立一个“欧洲联合体”的设想，也应被列入长期日程安排之中。 这一联合体应当建立在共同的人员、经济与能源范围基础之上。 在欧洲-大西洋共同体的新型安全制度、以及欧洲联合体的建立这两大因素的共同作用之下，西方国际影响力的下滑趋势将得以终止。"

            "Will Success Spoil Brazil? RIO DE JANEIRO – Brazil has been making international headlines of late, but not for traditional stories about urban violence, natural catastrophes, political corruption, or deforestation in the Amazon. At the G-20 Summit in London last April, for example, US President Barack Obama called for the world to pay heed to Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, the “most popular politician on earth,” and shook hands with him, saying: “My man right here. I love this guy.” In September, the ousted president of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, reappeared in the country inside the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa after three months of exile. Although his presence dramatically fuelled the situation for a time, Brazilian diplomats, working with the US, were able to reach agreement with Honduran authorities to allow Manuel Zelaya to return to office. Then came the news that Brazil will host the 2016 Summer Olympic Games – this coming on top of hosting the 2014 World Cup. As for the global – and fortunately now abating – economic crisis, Brazil has shined throughout, recording a fast and strong recovery. And, as if this good news were not enough, Brazil’s giant state oil company, Petrobrás, is already at work developing two huge deep-water oil fields discovered in the sea off the coast of Rio de Janeiro. For these and other reasons, Brazil is gaining the world’s attention. Brazilian democracy, at long last, is working well, following many years of military government, and its economy seems more robust than ever. As a result, many people are enthusiastically pointing to an increased international role for Brazil in the future. But two connected and major challenges lie ahead for Brazil and its government: the need to build a far more equal society and to resist the temptation to use nationalism to mask whatever domestic failures may manifest themselves. Brazil’s current success is rooted not only in Lula’s two terms, which must end in 2010. The economic stabilization program enacted by Fernando Henrique Cardoso since 1994 (the Real Plan), first as finance minister and then as president for two terms, solidified a structure that made it possible for Lula’s tenure to be so prosperous. This is not meant to take anything away from Lula. His presidency has guaranteed political stability and strengthened social cohesion. Indeed, by managing the political process to make the government work for Brazil’s people, Lula’s administration has made Brazil a truly stable and consensual democracy. There is nothing modest about that achievement, given Brazil’s traditional institutional instability and the series of major corruption scandals that engulfed Lula’s government in 2005 and 2006. Lula survived those scandals and did not move to amend the constitution in order to seek a third term, though some in Brazil pressed him to do so. Lula also enacted critically important social policies. Under his government, two million homes received electric power for the first time, 11 million very poor families gained the support of a minimum income (the Bolsa Família), the minimum salary grew 45% in real terms, thus benefiting 42 million people. Moreover, eight million jobs were created, 17 million people escaped poverty, and the income of the poorest 50% grew 32% – twice as fast as the income of the richest 10% in the same period. And Lula achieved all this without triggering inflation, which he knows – perhaps a result of his own impoverished childhood – wreaks havoc on the poor most of all. This vast transformation has not only generated a virtuous circle that strengthened institutional stability and social capital. It has also differentiated Brazil from other countries in Latin America, putting the country in the forefront in the region in terms of dealing with traditional social and economic injustices in a democratic way. Yet the remaining challenges are huge, for Brazil remains the seventh most unequal society in the world – and severe violence persists. Sixty-four percent of Brazilian homes lack electricity and sanitation, and only 22% have electricity, a telephone, a computer, a refrigerator, a television, and a washing machine. In the poorest region, the North and Northeast, the numbers fall to 8.6% and 8.3%. Among the young, almost 37% of 18-24-year-olds do not finish high school. Only half the population over age 25 has more than eight years of formal education. As for Brazil’s international role, a subtle competition is emerging with the US. America wants to conclude as many free-trade agreements in the region as it can, while Brazil favors expanding its custom union, Mercosul/Mercosur. The entrance of Venezuela into the Brazilian bloc, Brazilian leadership at the United Nations mission in Haiti, and Brazil’s role in the Honduran affair are all part of this emerging competition. If Brazil is to remain on its prosperous path, it must continue to give higher priority to its social and economic programs than to foreign adventures. The construction of a major egalitarian, free, and democratic society that respects and works with the international institutions is the best thing that Brazil can give to the world right now.",
            "成功会不会让巴西骄纵？ 巴西最近登上了国际新闻的头版头条，但却不是因为城市暴力、自然灾害、政治腐败或亚马逊地区森林砍伐等传统的报导。 去年4月召开的伦敦二十国峰会上，美国总统巴拉克·奥巴马呼吁世界关注巴西总统路易斯·伊纳西奥·卢拉·达席尔瓦，称他为“地球上最受欢迎的政治家 ” ， 奥巴马同达席尔瓦握手，说 ： “ 这是我的偶像。 我爱他 。 ” 9月，遭到驱逐的洪都拉斯总统曼努埃尔·塞拉亚在经历了三个月的流亡生活后在巴西驻特古西加尔巴大使馆再度露面。 虽然他的现身一度给本已混乱的局势火上浇油，但巴西外交人员与美国合作，成功地与洪都拉斯当局达成协议，允许曼努埃尔·塞拉亚重新执政。 随后传来消息说2016年夏季奥运会将在巴西举办 — — 巴西也同样是2014年世界杯的主办国。 在正在趋于缓和的全球经济危机中，巴西自始至终一直表现出色，出现了快速强劲的经济复苏。 这还不算，巴西的巨型国家石油企业巴西石油公司（Petrobrás）已经着手实施沿里约热内卢海岸线发现的两块巨型深水油田的开发工作。 上述以及其它原因让巴西受到世界的瞩目。 巴西的民主制度在历经多年的军政府统治后，终于得以修成正果，巴西经济也比以往任何时刻更加繁荣。 因此，许多人热情地指出巴西将在未来发挥更大的国际作用。 但巴西及其政府面临着两项相互关联的重大挑战：建设更为平等的社会，以及经受住利用民族主义掩盖任何国内失败的诱惑。 不仅是必须在2010年结束两届任期的卢拉造就了巴西目前的成功。 1994年来先任财政部长再任两届总统的费尔南多·恩里克·卡多佐推行的经济稳定计划（即雷亚尔计划）奠定了坚实的结构性基础，使得卢拉在其任期内有可能实现经济繁荣。 但这丝毫也不能抹杀卢拉的贡献。 他在总统任期内保障了政治稳定，加强了社会凝聚力。 事实上，卢拉内阁通过管理政治程序实现了政府为巴西人民服务，并使巴西成为真正稳定团结的民主国家。 考虑到一直困扰着巴西的制度动荡和2005、2006年几乎吞噬卢拉政府的系列重大腐败丑闻，这一成绩的取得绝非易事。 卢拉在那场丑闻中幸免于难，而且也顶住了来自巴西某些势力的压力，并未修改宪法谋求第三次连任。 卢拉还推行了至关重要的社会政策。 在以他为首的政府领导下，有两百万家庭首次用上了电，一千一百万极端贫困家庭获得了最低工资补助（家庭补助金计划 ） ， 最低薪酬按实值计算增长了45 % ， 并因此惠及了四千二百万民众。 此外，政府还创造了八百万个就业岗位，帮助一千七百万人实现脱贫，最贫困的半数人口收入增长了32 % — —这一比率相当于同时期10%最富裕人口收入增长速度的两倍。 卢拉在不引发通胀的前提下实现了上述所有目标，因为他知道 — — 这或许来自于他本人贫困的童年经历 — — 通胀带给穷人的灾难最为深重。 如此巨大的转变不仅创造了强化制度稳定和社会资本的良性循环，同时也让巴西从诸多南美国家之中脱颖而出，使其站在了拉美地区以民主方式应对传统社会和经济不平等现象的最前沿领域。 但余下的挑战也非常巨大，因为巴西仍然是世界第七大最不平等社会 — — 仍然存在着严重的暴力冲突。 百分之六十四的巴西家庭缺少电和卫生设备，只有22%的家庭能用上电、电话、电脑、冰箱、电视和洗衣机。 在最贫困的北部和东北部地区，这一数字下降到8.6%和8.3 % 。 有几乎37%的18到24岁的年轻人没有念完高中。 25岁以上人口中只有半数接受过8年以上的正规教育。 巴西在国际作用领域正在同美国进行着微妙的竞争。 美国希望能在区域内尽可能多的签订自由贸易协议，而巴西则更愿意进一步拓展其关税联盟和南方共同市场（Mercosul/Mercosur ） 。 委内瑞拉加入巴西集团、巴西人领导联合国的海地维和行动、以及巴西在洪都拉斯问题上所起的作用都构成了这种正在形成的竞争关系。 如果巴西想在繁荣大道上走得更远，就必须继续给予社会和经济计划比外资企业更多的支持。 建设尊重国际体系并与之合作的平等、自由和民主的社会是巴西能够献给世界的最好的礼物。"

            "Will Technology Kill Convergence? WASHINGTON, DC – At last week’s annual meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund in Lima, Peru, one topic that dominated discussions was the slowdown in emerging-economy growth. Hailed in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis as the new engines of the world economy, the emerging economies are now acting as a drag on global growth, and many argue that their era of rapid expansion – and their quest to achieve convergence with advanced-country income levels – is over. Are the doomsayers right? There is certainly reason for concern – beginning in China. After decades of nearly double-digit growth, China appears to be experiencing a marked slowdown – one that some argue is actually worse than official statistics indicate. As China’s growth slows, so does its demand for oil and commodities, with severe effects for other emerging economies that depend on commodity exports. Moreover, the benefits of lower commodity prices do not seem to have materialized among net importers, except perhaps India; if they have, they have been far from adequate to offset other growth-damaging forces. Meanwhile, the advanced economies are tentatively recovering from the 2008 crisis. As a result, the differential between growth in the emerging and advanced economies – aggregated from IMF data, and including Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan in the emerging group – has declined considerably. Indeed, after averaging three percentage points for two decades and rising to 4.8 percentage points in 2010, the percentage-point differential fell to 2.5 last year and is expected to amount to just 1.5 this year. The question, then, is whether the growth differential will remain as low at it is today. Those who believe that it will, typically rely on three arguments, all of which require some qualification. First, they argue that much convergence has already taken place in manufacturing. This is true, but it neglects the increasing interconnectedness of manufacturing and services, and the changing nature of many services. An iPad, for example, must not just be built; it also needs coding services. In a sense, it is actually more the product of the modern services sector than of manufacturing. And there are plenty of untapped opportunities for technological catch-up in, say, health, education, and financial services. Second, emerging-market bears point out that these economies have gained major productivity benefits from the migration of surplus rural labor to urban areas, a surplus that will soon be exhausted. This, too, is true. But it ignores the fact that there still is a huge reservoir of urban labor in the informal sector that, upon shifting to the formal sector, would provide an additional boost to productivity. The pessimists’ third argument is that emerging economies are not implementing fast enough the structural reforms needed to support long-term growth. Again, there is some truth to this argument: structural reforms are needed everywhere. But there is no proven way to measure the pace of their implementation. As a result, it is difficult to argue that the emerging economies have collectively slowed in their structural-reform efforts. But there may be a fourth mechanism at work, related to the changing – and seriously disruptive – nature of new technologies. A major driver of past catch-up, if only in terms of incremental growth, was the shift of many activities in both the services and manufacturing sectors from advanced economies to developing countries with lower wages. Now, however, a growing array of activities can be automated. And coding-supported products often have lower costs per unit of output than even very cheap labor can provide. So, whereas call centers, for example, used to be mostly staffed in low-wage countries, now the computer-robot that does most of the talking can be located in New York. That observation should not, however, overshadow fundamental economic insights – specifically, that trade and the location of production are determined by comparative, not absolute, advantage. A country will always have a comparative advantage in something; but that something changes. Many advanced countries, for example, now have a comparative advantage in high-value-added activities. In other words, thanks to their highly skilled labor forces, they are better equipped than their developing-country counterparts for activities like the production of made-to-measure specialized goods or, indeed, anything that requires a highly trained team to work in close proximity. But the technology-induced shifts that are underway could portend big disruptions in global value chains – disruptions affecting both developed and developing countries. In fact, we may have entered a period of fundamental change that could weaken growth everywhere, as the “old” shrinks before the “new” can occupy sufficient space. To be sure, the creative destruction that is taking place seems to be affecting developing-economy growth proportionately more than advanced-economy growth, largely because the new technologies are being put to work where they were invented, and developing countries have not yet managed sufficient imitation. But I am not convinced that “catch-up” opportunities will remain diminished – not least because it will always be easier to imitate than to invent. In fact, it could be argued that new “leap-frogging” may become possible. As experience in the telecommunications sector shows, the ability to adopt new technologies without first having to dismantle old systems can enable rapid progress. The key to enabling continued convergence – even at a fairly rapid pace – is good political governance. Developing-country governments must implement policies aimed at managing the impending transformation, while maintaining social solidarity and cohesion. That is the challenge they must meet at this time of great disruption.",
            "技术会扼杀趋同吗？ 华盛顿—在上周世界银行和国际货币基金组织（IMF）在秘鲁利马举行的年会上，一个主导了讨论过程的话题是新兴经济体增长放缓。 2008年金融危机爆发后，新兴经济体被誉为世界经济体的新增长引擎，但如今，新兴经济体成了全球增长的拖累因素，许多人认为，它们的快速扩张期已经结束，它们对实现向发达国家收入水平趋同的努力也已经结束。 这些末日论者说得对吗？ 当然，担忧的理由是存在的 — — 从中国开始。 在经历了几十年的近两位数的增长后，中国似乎开始经历显著放缓 — — 有人认为放缓幅度之大实际比官方统计数字更加糟糕。 随着中国增长的放缓，其对石油和大宗商品的需求也放缓了，这给其他依赖大宗商品出口的新兴经济体造成了严重影响。 此外，大宗商品价格下跌的好处并没有体现在净出口国身上（也许印度是个例外 ） ， 即使获得了好处，也远不足以抵消其他不利于增长的力量。 与此同时，发达经济体正在从2008年的危机小心翼翼地复苏。 结果，新兴和发达经济体之间的增长差异 — — 据IMF数据加总，香港、新加坡、韩国和台湾被归为新兴经济体组 — — 显著收缩。 事实上，二十年来，这一差异平均值为三个百分点，2010年上升到4.8个百分点，去年下降到2.5个百分点，今年预计将继续下降到1.5个百分点。 因此，问题是这一增长差异是否会保持在今天那么低的水平。 相信答案是肯定的人通常基于三个原因，这三个原因都值得商榷。 首先，他们认为趋同的大部分发生在制造业。 确实如此，但他们忽视了制造业和服务业日益互通的趋势和许多服务业性质的变化。 比如，一个iPad不仅仅包括制造过程，还需要编程服务。 从某种程度讲，iPad实际上更多地是现代服务业产品，而不是制造品。 而在（比如）医疗、教育和金融服务方面，有大量技术赶超机会等待新兴市场去把握。 其次，新兴市场悲观派指出，这些经济体生产率大提高主要来自农村剩余劳动力向城镇的迁移，而这一剩余劳动力很快就会耗尽。 的确如此。 但它忽视了一个事实：非正式部门仍存在巨大的城镇劳动力储备，只要他们进入正式部门，就能带来新的生产率刺激。 悲观者的第三个观点是新兴经济体实施支持长期增长所需要的结构改革的步伐不够快。 这一论点也有些道理：结构改革哪里都需要。 但没有经受过检验的方法可用于衡量结构改革实施的节奏。 因此，很难认为新兴市场在结构改革方面集体滞后了。 但也许还有第四个因素在起作用，即新技术的多变性 — — 以及严重的破坏性。 在过去，赶超的一大动力 — — 如果用增量增长衡量的话 — — 是服务业和制造业的许多活动从发达经济体转移到低工资的发展中国家。 但是，如今，越来越多的这些活动可以自动化。 代码支持的产品的单位产出成本通常比极低价劳动力所能提供的还要低。 因此，尽管（比如）呼叫中心大多在低工资国家运行，但如今，用电脑机器人进行大部分对话的呼叫中心也可以坐落在纽约。 但是，这一观察无法压倒基本经济学洞见 — — 具体而言，就是贸易和生产地由比较优势而非绝对优势决定。 一国总会在某些方面拥有比较优势；但“某些方面”是会变化的。 比如，许多发达国家现在的比较优势是高增加值活动。 换句话说，由于它们拥有高技能劳动力，因此比发展中国家更适合生产定制专业化产品或一切需要受过良好训练的团队紧密合作的活动。 但技术导致的正在发生的变迁可能预示着全球价值链的大幅扰动 — — 这些扰动既影响发达国家，也影响发展中国家。 事实上，我们可能已经进入了一个根本性变革时代 ， “ 旧”东西已经破坏而“新”东西尚未占据足够大的空间，所有国家的增长率都可能遭到削弱。 平心而论，正在发生的创造性破坏对发展中经济体的影响似乎相对来说大于发达经济体，这主要是因为，新技术正在发明它们的地方启用，而发展中国家尚无法进行足够的模仿。 但我不确定“赶超”机会会一直减少下去 — — 因为模仿总是比发明容易。 事实上，可以说，新的“蛙跳”会成为可能。 通讯业的经验表明，在不必破坏旧体系的情况下采取新技术的能力可以带来快速进步。 （甚至以相当快的速度）带来持续趋同的关键是良好的政治治理。 发展中国家政府必须实施旨在管理即将到来的转型的政策，同时保持社会团结和凝聚。 这是它们在大干扰时代所必须面对的挑战。"

            "Will the EU Keep Faith with Turkey? EMBARGO 6 SEPTEMBER 2004 More than forty years ago, Turkey applied for associate membership of the European Economic Community. With the Association agreement of 1963, a special relationship was established, culminating in the customs union of 1996. During all these years, European governments consistently confirmed Turkey's eligibility for full membership, making accession dependent on compliance with membership criteria. Turkey's formal recognition as a candidate state in 1999 led Turkey to undertake unprecedented reform efforts in the area of human and minority rights, including abolition of the death penalty, safeguards against torture, promotion of religious freedoms, gender equality, and restriction of the military's role in political life. Should the EU consider the accession criteria as having been fulfilled, it must decide to open negotiations in early 2005. Not to do so would mean to renege on political commitments and to severely damage the EU's credibility in the world. In many parts of Europe, however, Turkey's admission to the EU is viewed with skepticism owing to its size, relatively poor economy, fears of massive immigration, and, above all, cultural and societal differences - a euphemism for Islam. It would be foolish to deny that some of these factors represent serious challenges. However, they are often exaggerated and certainly not insurmountable. Negotiations with Turkey would be lengthy and accession may not occur before 2015. This period of time would offer both Turkey and the Union an opportunity to come to terms. With 80 million people, Turkey would be one of the largest EU states. But the size of a country plays only a limited role in the EU's decision-making process, because political influence within the Union depends more on economic power. Moreover, for decades Turkey has been a responsible member of many European institutions, and there is no reason to believe that it would act differently in the EU. Because of its weak economy, Turkey would be eligible for substantial EU assistance. The size of these transfers, however, would depend on the EU's financial policies at the time of admission, the outcome of accession negotiations, and economic developments in Turkey. In any case, the EU's practice of \"capping\" its budget would prevent an explosion in the financial costs entailed by Turkey's accession. Immigration should not be a cause for undue concern, either. Human mobility is limited, and Turkey workers' would probably be allowed to move freely within the EU only after a long transition period, possibly not before 2025. Given the expected upswing of Turkey's economy and its declining birthrate, experts predict a figure of around 2.7 million immigrants by that point. Meanwhile, diminishing and aging populations in most of Europe will have made immigration a necessity. Among the countries from where immigration to the EU is probable, Turkey has the best prospects for successful adaptation. It is Turkey's Muslim population that creates the strongest emotions. Many feel that Turkey simply does not fit into a European society based on Christian traditions and culture. It is also feared that Islamists may one day turn Turkey into a fundamentalist state. Unlikely as it may be in view of Turkey's deeply rooted secularism, such a risk cannot be totally excluded. But the same is true for any other democracy, where radical groups could well misuse the democratic process for their purposes. Surely, the best protection against such a calamity is to strengthen Turkey's democratic system, which can best be achieved by anchoring it firmly in a bloc of similarly democratic countries. As for the EU, it must decide whether it wants to be a closed \"Christian club\" or an open and inclusive society, drawing strength from cultural and religious diversity. Turkey's accession to the Union would give a powerful answer, one that would be heard with particular clarity in the Islamic world. The need to refute arguments against Turkey's admission to the EU leaves the advantages rarely mentioned: its unique geopolitical position at the crossroads of the Balkans, Southern Caucasus, Central Asia, and the Middle East - vitally important regions for Europe's security; its role as mayor transit country for energy supplies; its military capabilities at a time when the EU is developing its new European Defense Policy; and the great potential of the Turkish economy, with its young and dynamic labor force. At the same time, the risks of rejecting Turkey must also be taken into account: the likelihood that the reform process would collapse, bringing radical currents to the fore and leading to instability and political unrest at the EU's doorsteps. Turkish EU membership presents both opportunities and challenges. On balance, however, the advantages far outweigh the risks.",
            "欧盟会兑现对土耳其的承诺吗？ 2004 年 9 月 ， 6 号禁令 四十多年前，土耳其申请了欧共体候补成员。 双方的特殊关系从1963年签订候补协议时开始，并于1996年订立关税联盟时达到了高潮。 这些年来，欧洲政府一直承认土耳其的完全会员资格，条件是土耳其要遵守成员国的行为准则。 1999年正式承认候补资格后，土耳其在人权和少数民族权利领域开始了前所未有的改革，包括取消死刑、反对酷刑、推动宗教自由、性别平等和限制军队在政治生活中的作用。 如果欧盟认为达到了准入条件，就必须在2005年初开始谈判。 不这么做就意味着不履行政治承诺，会严重损害欧盟的国际信誉。 但欧洲许多国家都对土耳其的加入持怀疑态度，因为它疆域辽阔、经济也欠发达，他们害怕土耳其进入欧盟会引发大规模移民潮，更重要的是，土耳其与欧洲国家存在着文化和社会方面的巨大差异－说得再直接点，土耳其是个伊斯兰国家。 否认这些因素会带来挑战是愚蠢的，但也不能过分夸大，甚至夸大到无法克服。 与土耳其的谈判过程也许会很漫长，2015年前也可能不会有结果。 但这段时间却给了土耳其和欧盟机会进行自我调整，以便最终达到要求。 有着8000万人口，土耳其会是欧盟最大的国家之一。 但在欧盟的决策过程中，国家的大小起不了决定作用，因为欧盟内部的政治影响更多地取决于经济方面的实力。 此外，几十年来，土耳其一直是很多欧洲机构最忠实的成员，我们没有理由相信加入欧盟会改变这一切。 因为经济欠发达，土耳其会得到欧盟的大量援助。 但拨款的具体数额要看欧盟当时的金融政策、进入谈判的结果和土耳其自身的经济状况。 不管怎样，欧盟的财政限额政策会防止土耳其加入带来的财政开支大幅增长。 移民问题也无须引起过多的担心。 人员流动是有限的，而且土耳其劳工只有在很长的过渡期后才可以在欧洲自由流动，这种过渡可能一直延续到2025年。 考虑到土耳其的经济发展和出生率下降，专家预计届时的移民数量可能在270万人。 与此同时，欧洲多数国家人口数量的减少和年龄的老化有必要依靠移民来补充。 可能移民到欧盟的国家中，土耳其人最有可能融合成功。 但激起最强烈反对的是土耳其的穆斯林们。 很多人认为土耳其根本不可能融入建立在基督教传统和文化基础上的欧洲社会。 人们害怕有一天，伊斯兰份子会把土耳其变成原教旨主义国家。 虽然根深蒂固的世俗主义使这种转变不太可能发生，但毕竟不能完全排除这样的危险。 但反过来想想，其它民主社会也有同样的问题，激进组织完全可能利用民主进程为自己的目标服务。 当然，对这种灾难的最好保护是加强土耳其的民主系统，而最好的办法就是让它在类似的民主国家中深深地扎根。 至于欧盟，它必须选择想成为封闭的\"基督教俱乐部 \" ， 还是开放、包容的社会，从文化和宗教的多元性中汲取力量。 土耳其加入欧盟会做出有力的回答，伊斯兰世界会更清楚地感受到这种影响。 对反对土耳其入盟论调的驳斥常常使人们忽略了它真正的优势：它地处巴尔干、南高加索、中亚和中东交叉点的独特地理位置－这些地区都对欧洲安全起着至关重要的作用；它还是能源供应的中转站；欧盟制定新欧洲防卫政策时也要借助土耳其的军事力量；土耳其的经济潜力巨大，劳动力年轻、充满活力。 与此同时，也必须考虑拒绝土耳其的危险：改革进程可能半途而废、极端势力可能走到前台，在欧洲大门口造成局势不稳和政治动荡。 土耳其成为欧盟成员既是机遇、又是挑战。 但权衡利弊，利益会远远超过风险。"

            "Will the Euro Dethrone the Dollar? Much of America’s dominance in world finance comes from the dollar’s status as international money. America’s commitment to free capital markets, the rule of law, and price stability confer credibility on the dollar as a store of value. But American spending habits have undermined the dollar’s reputation, with the excess supply of dollars on world markets depressing its price. This spring, the euro’s exchange rate against the dollar reached an all-time high, and central banks have increased the euro share of their international reserves. Is the dollar about to lose the crown of world finance to the euro? History suggests otherwise, despite a vulnerable dollar. American financial supremacy in the twenty-first century resembles Britain’s position in world finance a century ago. Before the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, the pound sterling served as the currency of choice for international transactions, just as the dollar does today, and the world’s borrowers visited the City of London to raise capital. The British economist John Maynard Keynes worried that countries would not use sterling to settle trading balances with each other if the pound were not viewed as a reliable store of value. The “future position of the City of London,” according to Keynes, depended on the pound sterling continuing to serve the business world as the equivalent of gold. Britain maintained the pound’s convertibility into gold at the outbreak of the Great War to preserve its credibility as the international medium of exchange. The dollar could not challenge sterling’s role as the world’s currency without matching its reputation. August 1914 provided the opportunity. The biggest gold outflow in a generation imperiled America’s ability to repay its debts abroad. Fear that the US would abandon the gold standard sent the dollar plummeting on world markets. But Treasury Secretary William G. McAdoo secured American financial honor in August 1914 by remaining true to gold while everyone else, except for the British, abandoned their obligations. Despite the dollar’s instant credibility, however, it took more than a decade for America’s currency to match Britain’s as an international medium of exchange. Payment habits melt at a glacier’s pace. Britain’s transformation from international creditor to international debtor during the Great War gave the dollar a second wind in its battle with sterling. The British were forced to abandon gold convertibility in April 1919 – a tactical withdrawal intended to pave the way for Britain’s return to the former $4.8665 parity with the American dollar. Six years later, in April 1925, Britain confirmed its monetary credibility and returned to the gold standard. But the pound had already suffered irreparable damage. The experience of 1914 implies that a credible alternative can replace an entrenched world currency, especially after an unfavorable balance of trade has weakened it. But even then, dethroning the reigning king of international exchange takes time. Today, the euro – a currency without a country – lacks a long track record of credibility. Thirteen countries in the European Union use the euro as money. But the commitment of these independent political entities to the euro cannot match the history of America’s commitment to the dollar. The European Central Bank, established in 1998, has a mandate to manage the new currency to maintain price stability. But the ECB needs time to establish its inflation-fighting credentials. It cannot hitch a ride on gold, the way America did a century ago. So the euro must earn its reputation crisis by crisis to confront the dollar’s dominance as the currency of choice for international transactions. Recent experience with the euro as an official reserve asset is instructive. Between 2000 and 2005, the dollar lost more than 25% of its value against the euro. Meanwhile, the fraction of international reserves held in euros grew from 18% to 24%, and the dollar’s share dropped from 71% to 66%. In short, the euro has clearly made some headway during this period of US balance of payment deficits, but this reflects an evolutionary decline in the dollar’s dominance, not a revolutionary regime shift. What might trigger a fatal run on the dollar in world markets? While a broad and abrupt sell-off by major foreign holders of dollars – for example, China – appears unlikely, a cataclysmic event, similar to the outbreak of the Great War in 1914, could prompt a search for a new international medium of exchange. In the modern era of automated payments, the upheaval might come from a terrorist attack that undermines the computerized transfer facilities of the world’s banking system. A catastrophic loss of electronic records could surely destroy the credibility of the dollar as the international medium of exchange. But exactly what would replace the dollar under such circumstances remains an open question. After all, a loss of computer records would make the euro equally suspect. Perhaps gold, a store of value impervious to physical distortion, could make a comeback. Of course, one can only hope that such a scenario remains pure conjecture.",
            "欧元会取代美元的位置吗？ 美国在世界金融中的霸主地位很大一部分来自于美元作为国际货币的地位。 美国对自由的资本市场、法治以及价格稳定的承诺带给美元作为价值储备的可信度。 但是，美国人的消费习惯破坏了美元的声誉，而美元在世界市场上的过度供应又压抑了它的价格。 今年春天，欧元与美元的汇率达到了历史新高，各国的中央银行也增加了欧元在其国际储备中的份额。 美元是否要将世界金融的皇冠拱手让给欧元呢？ 历史表明，尽管美元软弱，但是情况还是相反。 美国在二十一世纪的金融霸主地位和英国在一个世纪前的地位相似。 在1914年8月第一次世界大战爆发之前，英镑正如当今的美元一样是国际交易的首选货币，全世界的借款者都造访伦敦时来筹集资本。 英国经济学家凯恩斯担心，如果人们不把英镑看作可靠的价值储备，那么，各国就不会用英镑来结算各自的交易结余。 凯恩斯认为 ， “ 伦敦市的未来地位”取决于英镑继续作为黄金的等价物为工商界服务。 英国在第一次世界大战爆发之际维持英镑可兑换为黄金来维持其国际交易媒介的信誉。 美元不追赶上英镑的声誉就无法挑战英镑世界货币的作用。 1914年8月提供了这样的一个机遇。 在整整一代人中最大的一次黄金外流破坏了美国偿还海外债务的能力。 人们担心美国将会放弃金本位制，美元在世界市场上暴跌。 但是，正当除了英国以外的其他所有国家都放弃其义务之际，美国财政部长麦克阿杜在1914年8月坚持金本位不变，从而为美国赢得了金融信誉。 但是，尽管美元声誉日隆，美国货币追赶上英镑作为国际交易媒介还是花了十年多的时间。 支付习惯改变决非一朝一夕。 英国在第一次世界大战中从国际债权人沦为国际债务人，从而给了美元在与英镑的较量中的第二次生机。 英国被迫在1919年4月放弃黄金兑换，这是英国准备回到从前一英镑兑换4.8665美元等价的战术性撤退。 六年之后，在1925年4月，英国确认其货币信誉并且返回金本位制。 但是英镑已经遭受了不可弥补的损害。 1914年的经验表明，具有可信度的替换货币可以取代地位牢靠的世界货币，特别是在不良贸易平衡削弱这一货币之后。 但是即使在那时，夺取国际交易国王宝座还是要假以时日。 如今，欧元这一没有国度的货币缺乏长久的信誉历史记录。 欧盟的十三个国家使用欧元作为货币。 但是这些独立政治实体对欧元的承诺却无法与美国对美元的承诺历史相提并论。 欧洲中央银行建立于1998年，其使命是管理这一新货币来维持价格稳定。 但是欧洲央行需要时间来建立其与通货膨胀作斗争的资格。 它无法像美国在一个世纪以前那样搭黄金的车。 所以欧元必须通过一个又一个危机来赢得其声誉来对抗美元作为国际交易首选货币的霸主地位。 欧元作为官方储备资产近来的经历颇能说明情况。 2000年至2005年期间，美元对欧元贬值25 ％ 。 与此同时，欧元在国际储备中持有率从18％上升到24 ％ ， 而美元则从71％下降到66 ％ 。 简而言之，欧元在美国收支平衡赤字期间显然取得了进步，但是这反映出美元霸主地位的演变性下降，而非革命性的大局变动。 有什么事件可能会触发国际市场上致命性的挤兑美元呢？ 尽管主要的外国美元持有者例如中国突然间大范围抛售美元看起来不大可能，但是，某一类似于1914年第一次世界大战爆发那样的灾难性事件有可能促使人们寻求一种新的国际交易媒介。 在现代自动支付年代里，这一动荡可能来自某一破坏世界银行体系计算机化的转移设施的恐怖主义袭击。 电子记录灾难性的丢失几乎会摧毁美元作为国际交易媒介的信誉。 但是在这种情况下什么会取代美元还是一个没有答案的问题。 毕竟，丢失计算机记录也会让欧元也一样可疑。 黄金是可以抵御物理变形的价值储备，也许它会卷土重来。 当然，人们只能希望这种情形只是一种臆测而已。"

            "Will the Euro Survive the Current Crisis? CAMBRIDGE – The European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) and the euro are about to celebrate their tenth anniversary. The euro was introduced without serious problems and has since functioned well, with the European Central Bank delivering the low inflation that is its sole mandate. But the current economic crisis may provide a severe test of the euro’s ability to survive in more troubled times. While the crisis could strengthen the institutions provided by the EMU, it could also create multiple risks, of which member countries need to be aware if they want to avoid them. The primary problem is that conditions in individual EMU members may develop in such different ways that some national political leaders could be tempted to conclude that their countries would be better served by adopting a mix of policies different from that of the other members. The current differences in the interest rates of euro-zone government bonds show that the financial markets regard a break-up as a real possibility. Ten-year government bonds in Greece and Ireland, for example, now pay nearly a full percentage point above the rate on comparable German bonds, and Italy’s rate is almost as high. There have, of course, been many examples in history in which currency unions or single-currency states have broken up. Although there are technical and legal reasons why such a split would be harder for an EMU country, there seems little doubt that a country could withdraw if it really wanted to. The most obvious reason that a country might choose to withdraw is to escape from the one-size-fits-all monetary policy imposed by the single currency. A country that finds its economy very depressed during the next few years, and fears that this will be chronic, might be tempted to leave the EMU in order to ease monetary conditions and devalue its currency. Although that may or may not be economically sensible, a country in a severe economic downturn might very well take such a policy decision. The Stability and Growth Pact, which limits euro-zone members’ fiscal deficits, is another reason why a country might want to leave the EMU. In a serious downturn, a country may wish to pursue a traditional Keynesian policy through large-scale, deficit-financed fiscal stimulus. Although the Stability and Growth Pact may be elastic enough to permit some deficit stimulus, a country may feel constrained from acting as aggressively as it wants. The current financial crisis raises yet another problem: the lack of a clear “lender of last resort.” It remains to be seen how willing the ECB will be to provide national central banks with the volume of euros needed to play this role fully. If a country sees its banks failing because its national bank cannot lend them enough, it may chose to leave the EMU so that its central bank can provide whatever amount of local currency it deems necessary. Moreover, the current economic crisis has led to renewed talk about the need for the European Union to have taxing authority. Whatever the logic of that proposition, it would open the door to much greater income redistribution. High-income countries might find that reason enough to want out. Even if officials do not want to abandon the euro, they may come to do so as a result of a strategy of trying to get other countries to agree to a policy change. A country that believes that monetary or fiscal policy is too tight may threaten to leave if policy is not changed. That is clearly a substantial risk if the country is Germany or France. But even if it is one of the smaller countries, it might be a serious threat because it could be seen as the beginning of the end. So either type of country could make the threat in the hope that it would be enough to cause their EMU colleagues to agree to their desired change in policy. The risk, of course, is that the other countries may not be intimidated. The threatening country would then have to choose whether to accepting a humiliating defeat and stay, or stand on “principle” and leave. All of this assumes that political leaders would select only a policy change that they think will be in their nation’s long-term interest. But there is also a risk that some politicians act solely out of self-interest, seizing on the economic downturn as an opportunity to get elected by promising to withdraw the country from the EMU, or by saying that they will threaten to do so if the other member countries do not agree to their proposed policy changes. None of these risks implies that the monetary union will inevitably be a victim of this severe economic downturn. But the downturn will be a more severe test for the euro than any that it faced during its first ten years.",
            "欧元经得住当前的危机吗？ 剑桥－欧洲经济与货币联盟(EMU)和欧元快要进行十周年庆了。 欧元的引进没有产生严重的问题，并且此后运行良好，与此同时欧洲中央银行将低通胀作为其首要任务 但是，当前的经济危机可能对欧元在更困难时期继续运行下去的能力提出了严峻的考验。 虽然当前的经济危机可能加强欧洲经济与货币联盟提供的制度机构，但是也可能产生多重风险。 如果欧洲经济与货币联盟的成员国想要避免这些风险，它们就必须意识到这些风险。 主要问题是，单个的欧洲经济与货币联盟成员国国情的发展可能非常不同，以至于一些国家的政治领导人可能倾向于认为，他们的国家通过采取和其他成员国不同的各种政策，对国家更为有利。 目前欧元区政府债券利率的差异表明，金融市场认为欧洲经济与货币联盟的分裂是一个现实的可能。 例如，希腊和爱尔兰的十年期政府债券现在支付的利率，和可比较的德国政府债券比起来，几乎整整高了一个百分点，而意大利的债券利率几乎也一样高。 当然，历史上有很多货币联盟或单一货币国家分裂的例子。 虽然对欧洲经济与货币联盟成员国来说，因为技术和法律上的原因，这样的分裂更为困难，但是，如果欧洲经济与货币联盟成员国真地想退出，就可以退出，人们对此的疑问似乎很少。 欧洲经济与货币联盟成员国可能选择退出的最明显的原因，是为了避免因为单一货币所造成的不区分具体情形而适用于所有成员国的货币政策。 一个发现其经济在未来几年会很萧条而且担心萧条会延续很长时间的成员国，可能会为了缓和其货币状况并且使其货币贬值，而倾向于离开欧洲经济与货币联盟。 虽然这样做在经济上可能是明智的，也可能是不明智的，但是，一个遭受严重经济下滑的国家极有可能做出这样的政策决策 限制欧元区成员国财政赤字的《稳定和增长公约 》 ， 是另一个欧洲经济与货币联盟成员国想退出联盟的原因。 在经济严重下滑的时候，一个国家可能希望通过大规模的扩大财政赤字的财政刺激方案，来实施传统的凯恩斯政策。 虽然《稳定和增长公约》可能有足够的弹性来允许一些成员国的赤字刺激方案，但是，有些国家仍然可能会觉得不能像自己想的那样采取激进的措施。 当前的金融危机还提出了另一个问题：缺少一个明确的“最后贷款人 ” 。 欧洲中央银行给欧洲经济与货币联盟成员国的中央银行提供完全扮演这一角色所需的欧元数量的意愿，还有待观察。 如果一个国家因为它的国家银行不能借给它足够的钱，而认为其银行不起作用，它可能会选择退出欧洲经济与货币联盟，以便其中央银行能够提供其认为必要的无论多大数量的本国货币。 而且，目前的经济危机导致了对欧盟拥有征税权力必要性的重新讨论。 不管这种必要性主张的逻辑是什么，它都会为更大的收入再分配打开大门。 高收入国家可能会发现这个理由对退出欧洲经济与货币联盟来说，已经足够了。 即使官员们不想放弃欧元，但是，作为使其他成员国同意进行政策变化的策略的结果，他们也有可能这样做。 一个认为货币或财政政策太紧的国家，可能会扬言如果不改变政策，就退出欧洲经济与货币联盟。 如果上述国家是德国或法国的话，这显然是一个重大的风险。 但是，即便是欧洲经济与货币联盟中的一个小国，这也可能是一个严重的威胁，因为它会被看成是结束的开始。 因此，大国和小国都能发出威胁，并希望这些威胁就足够使其欧洲经济与货币联盟中的同事同意他们想要的政策变化。 当然，这样做的风险是其他国家可能不受胁迫。 那么，发出威胁的国家将不得不选择是接受羞辱性的失败留下来，还是坚持“原则”退出。 所有这些，都是假设政治领导人只选择了他们认为符合其国家长远利益的一个政策变化。 但是，也有一些政治家仅仅出于自身利益，通过承诺使国家退出欧洲经济与货币联盟，或者声称如果其他成员国不同意他们提议的政策变化他们就扬言退出的方式，抓住经济下滑问题，将其作为使自己当选的机会。 这些风险中的任何一个都不意味着，货币联盟将不可避免的成为此次严重经济下滑的牺牲品。 但是，经济下滑和欧元在其第一个十年中面临的其他考验相比，要严峻得多。"

            "Will the IMF Stand Up to Europe? CAMBRIDGE – As the eurozone crisis continues to deepen, the International Monetary Fund may finally be acknowledging the need to reassess its approach. New Managing Director Christine Lagarde’s recent call for forced recapitalization of Europe’s bankrupt banking system is a good start. European officials’ incensed reaction – the banks are fine, they insist, and need only liquidity support – should serve to buttress the Fund’s determination to be sensible about Europe. Until now, the Fund has sycophantically supported each new European initiative to rescue the over-indebted eurozone periphery, committing more than $100 billion to Greece, Portugal, and Ireland so far. Unfortunately, the IMF is risking not only its members’ money, but, ultimately, its own institutional credibility. Only a year ago, at the IMF’s annual meeting in Washington, DC, senior staff were telling anyone who would listen that the whole European sovereign-debt panic was a tempest in a teapot. Using slick PowerPoint presentations with titles like “Default in Today’s Advanced Economies: Unnecessary, Undesirable, and Unlikely,” the Fund tried to convince investors that eurozone debt was solid as a rock. Even for Greece, the IMF argued, debt dynamics were not a serious concern, thanks to anticipated growth and reforms. Never mind the obvious flaw in the Fund’s logic, namely that countries such as Greece and Portugal face policy and implementation risks far more akin to emerging markets than to truly advanced economies such as Germany and the United States. As the situation deteriorated, one might have guessed that the IMF would mark its beliefs to market, as it were, and adopt a more cautious tone. Instead, at the IMF’s April 2011 interim meeting, a senior official declared that the Fund now considers troubled Spain to be a core eurozone country like Germany, rather than a peripheral country like Greece, Portugal, or Ireland. Evidently, investors were supposed to infer that for all practical purposes they should think of Spanish and German debt as identical – the old hubris of the eurozone. My own sarcastic reaction was to think, “Oh, now the IMF thinks that some of the core eurozone countries are a default risk.” Having served as the IMF’s chief economist from 2001 to 2003, I am familiar with the Fund’s need to walk a tightrope between building investor confidence and shaking up complacent policymakers. But it is one thing to be circumspect in the midst of a crisis; it is quite another to spew nonsense. The late Chicago-school economist George Stigler would have described the IMF’s role in Europe as reflecting acute “regulatory capture.” Simply put, Europe and the US control too much power in the IMF, and their thinking is too dominant. What European leaders may want most from the Fund are easy loans and strong rhetorical support. But what Europe really needs is the kind of honest assessment and tough love that the Fund has traditionally offered to its other, less politically influential, clients. The IMF’s blind spot in dealing with Europe until now is only partly due to European voting power. It also stems from an “us” and “them” mentality that similarly permeates research at the top Wall Street investment houses. Analysts who have worked their entire lives only on advanced economies have learned to bet on things going well, because for the couple of decades prior to the crisis, things mostly did go well – very well. That is why, for example, so many keep assuming that a normal rapid recovery is just around the corner. But the financial crisis should have reminded everyone that the distinction between advanced economies and emerging markets is not a bright red line. In his recent speech in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, US Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke forcefully complained that political paralysis has possibly become the principal impediment to recovery. But analysts accustomed to working on emerging markets understand that such paralysis is very difficult to avoid after a financial crisis. Rather than slavishly believing policymakers’ assurances, emerging-market researchers have learned to be cynical about official promises. All too often, everything that can be done wrong will be done wrong. The IMF needs to bring much more of this brand of skepticism to its assessment of eurozone debt dynamics, instead of constantly seeking strained assumptions that would make the debt appear sustainable. Anyone looking closely at Europe’s complex options for extricating itself from its debt straightjacket should realize that political constraints will be a huge obstacle no matter which route Europe takes. Even outside Europe, the IMF has long given too much credence to sitting governments, rather than focusing on the long-term interests of the country and its people. The Fund is doing Europe’s people no favor by failing to push aggressively for a more realistic solution, including dramatic debt write-downs for peripheral eurozone countries and re-allocating core-country guarantees elsewhere. Now that the Fund has squarely acknowledged the huge capital holes in many European banks, it should start pressing forcefully for a comprehensive and credible solution to the eurozone debt crisis, a solution that will involve either partial breakup of the eurozone or fundamental constitutional reform. Europe’s future, not to mention the future of the IMF, depends on it.",
            "IMF会力挺欧洲吗？ 坎布里奇 — — 随着欧元区危机的继续深化，IMF或将不得不承认有必要反思其作为了。 新总裁拉加德最近提出应该对欧洲已经破产的银行体系强行予以重组，这是个不错的开始。 欧洲官员被激怒了，他们坚持说，银行们一切都好，需要的只是流动性支持。 欧洲官员的态度应该能够支持IMF对欧洲的判断的可靠性。 到目前为止，对于欧洲所提出的任何救助债务深重的欧元区外围国家的方案，IMF无不大力支持，其热情程度甚至有阿谀奉承之嫌。 希勒、葡萄牙和爱尔兰已经获得了超过1000亿美元援助承诺。 不幸的是，IMF这么做不仅是在拿其成员国的钱冒险，更严重的是，归根到底，它所押上的赌注是自己的机构名誉。 一年前，在IMF华盛顿年会上，只要你愿意听，高级官员就会告诉你，整个欧洲主权债务危机纯属小题大做。 IMF制作了精美的PPT，打着《今日发达经济体的违约：没有必要、不受欢迎、断无可能》之类的标题，试图让投资者相信，欧元区坚如磐石。 即使对于希腊，IMF也认为其债务动态并无值得深虑的必要，因为该地区增长强劲，而且会实施改革。 IMF这么说存在明显的逻辑漏洞：希腊和葡萄牙这样的国家，它们所面临的政策和实施政策的风险更接近于新兴市场，而不是德国和美国这样的真正发达国家。 但那又怎么样呢。 随着情况的恶化，你也许会认为IMF将向往常一样信赖市场，并在放话时采取更加谨慎的语调。 但是，在2011年4月的IMF中期会议上，一位高级官员宣称，IMF将陷入困境的西班牙视为和德国同等的欧元区核心国家，而不是像希腊、葡萄牙和爱尔兰这样的外围国家。 显然，他们认为务实的投资者会因此推断，西班牙和德国债务完全等价 — — 此乃欧元区固有的傲慢。 我不无讽刺地想 ： “ 哦，现在IMF认为某些欧元区核心国家也存在违约风险了 。 ” 作为2001—2003年IMF首席经济学家，我十分熟悉IMF的处境 — — 它需要在提振投资者的信心和威慑踌躇满志的政客之间走钢丝。 但在危机中保持细心周到是一回事，信口胡说则是完全不同的另一回事。 已故的芝加哥学派经济学家乔治·斯蒂格勒会把IMF在欧洲的角色称为病入膏肓的“监管俘虏 ” 。 在IMF，欧洲和美国把持了太多的权力，在行为方式中占据了太大的主导地位。 欧洲领导人最希望从IMF手中获得的是宽松的贷款和给力的口头支持。 但欧洲实际上需要的是诚实的评估和苦口良药，即IMF传统上对政治影响力较低的客户所做的那些事。 在应对欧洲问题上，IMF至今仍存在盲区，欧洲在IMF所拥有的投票权只是原因之一。 “我们”和“他们”有别的心态也是IMF不能客观行事的原因，这一点在华尔街顶级投资机构的研究中也存在。 一辈子都在研究发达经济体的分析师得到的经验是凡事朝好的方向看，因为从危机前的20年来看，一切都会好的 — — 是大好不是小好。 这就是为什么很多人认为正常的快速复苏马上就会到来的原因。 但金融危机提醒所有人，发达经济体和新兴市场之间的区别并不是不可跨越的鸿沟。 在最新的俄怀明州杰克森霍尔讲话中，美联储主席伯南克大力抨击了政治僵局，指出这可能已经成为复苏的最大障碍。 但习惯于研究新兴市场的分析师早就明白，类似的政治僵局在金融危机爆发后是很难避免的。 新兴市场研究员才不会盲信政客的信誓旦旦，他们早就学会了对官方承诺持怀疑态度。 只要是可能做错的事，最后无一幸免地都出了错，这样例子发生得还少吗？ IMF需要更多地怀疑它对欧元区债务动态所做的评估，而不是不遗余力地寻找站不住脚的假设证明债务仍然可持续。 任何近距离观察欧洲为将自己救出债务缠身状态所面临的复杂选择的人都应该意识到，不管欧洲选择哪条路，政治约束将成为巨大障碍。 即使在欧洲之外，IMF也总是过分迁就在任政府，而不是专注于一国及其人民的长期利益。 为欧洲人民着想，IMF应该大力推行更现实的解决方案，包括对外围欧元区国家的大规模债务减记并重新分配核心国家对其他国家的担保。 如今，IMF已经承认大量欧洲银行存在巨大的资本漏洞，那么，它应该开始大力推行全面可信的欧元区债务危机解决方案了。 这一方案包括部分分解欧元区以及基础宪政改革。 欧洲的未来（更不用说IMF了）便系于此。"

            "Will the Polluters Pay for Climate Change? I am writing this in New York in early August, when the mayor declared a “heat emergency” to prevent widespread electricity outages from the expected high use of air conditioners. City employees could face criminal charges if they set their thermostats below 78 degrees Fahrenheit (25.5 Celsius). Nevertheless, electricity usage has reached near-record levels. Meanwhile California has emerged from its own record-breaking heat wave. For the United States as a whole, the first six months of 2006 were the hottest in more than a century. Europe is experiencing an unusually hot summer, too. July set new records in England and the Netherlands, where weather data go back more than 300 years. The hot northern summer fits well with the release of An Inconvenient Truth, a documentary film featuring former US Vice-President Al Gore. Using some remarkable graphs, images, and other information, the film makes a compelling case that our carbon dioxide emissions are causing global warming, or, at the very least, contributing to it, and that we must urgently address the issue. Americans tend to talk a lot about morality and justice. But most Americans still fail to realize that their country’s refusal to sign the Kyoto protocol, and their subsequent business–as-usual approach to greenhouse gas emissions, is a moral failing of the most serious kind. It is already having harmful consequences for others, and the greatest inequity is that it is the rich who are using most of the energy that leads to the emissions that cause climate change, while it is the poor who will bear most of the costs. (To see what you can do to reduce your own contribution, go to www.climatecrisis.net.) To see the inequity, I merely have to glance up at the air conditioner that is keeping my office bearable. While I’ve done more than the mayor requested, setting it at 82F (27C), I’m still part of a feedback loop. I deal with the heat by using more energy, which leads to burning more fossil fuel, putting more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and heating up the planet more. It even happened when I watched An Inconvenient Truth: on a warm evening, the cinema was so chilly that I wished I had brought a jacket. Heat kills. A heat wave in France in 2003 caused an estimated 35,000 deaths, and a hot spell similar to the one Britain had last month caused more than 2,000 deaths, according to official estimates. Although no particular heat wave can be directly attributed to global warming, it will make such events more frequent. Moreover, if global warming continues unchecked, the number of deaths that occur when rainfall becomes more erratic, causing both prolonged droughts and severe floods, will dwarf the death toll from hot weather in Europe. More frequent intense hurricanes will kill many more. Melting polar ice will cause rising seas to inundate low-lying fertile delta regions on which hundreds of millions of people grow their food. Tropical diseases will spread, killing still more people. Overwhelmingly, the dead will be those who lack the resources to adapt, to find alternative sources of food, and who do not have access to health care. Even in rich countries, it usually isn’t the rich who die in natural disasters. When Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans, those who died were the poor in low-lying areas who lacked cars to escape. If this is true in a country like the US, with a reasonably efficient infrastructure and the resources to help its citizens in times of crisis, it is even more evident when disasters strike developing countries, because their governments lack the resources needed, and because, when it comes to foreign assistance, rich nations still do not count all human lives equally. According to United Nations figures, in 2002 per capita emissions of greenhouse gases in the US were 16 times higher than in India, 60 times higher than in Bangladesh, and more than 200 times higher than in Ethiopia, Mali, or Chad. Other developed nations with emissions close to those of the US include Australia, Canada, and Luxembourg. Russia, Germany, Britain, Italy, France, and Spain all have levels between a half and a quarter that of the US. This is still significantly above the world average, and more than 50 times that of the poorest nations in which people will die from global warming. If a polluter harms others, those who are harmed normally have a legal remedy. For example, if a factory leaks toxic chemicals into a river that I use to irrigate my farm, killing my crops, I can sue the factory owner. If the rich nations pollute the atmosphere with carbon dioxide, causing my crops to fail because of changing rainfall patterns, or my fields are inundated by a rise in the sea level, shouldn’t I also be able to sue? Camilla Toulmin, who directs the International Institute for Environment and Development, a London-based NGO, was present at a lecture on climate change that Al Gore gave in June. She asked him what he thought about compensation for those who are hit hardest by climate change, but who have done the least to cause it. The question, she reports on www.opendemocracy.net, seemed to take him by surprise, and he did not support the idea. Like Toulmin, I wonder if this is a truth that is just too inconvenient, even for him.",
            "污染者会为气候变化付出代价吗？ 我八月上旬在纽约写这篇文章，当时，纽约市长宣布实行“高温紧急状态”来防止由于预期的大量使用空调而造成的大范围停电。 市政雇员如果把他们的空调温度调到华氏78度 (摄氏25.5度) 以下就会面临刑事指控。 但是，用电量还是接近历史最高记录。 与此同时，加利福尼亚刚刚走出该州自己的破记录的热浪。 美国全国而言，2006年的头六个月是一个多世纪内最热的。 欧洲也在经历一个不同寻常的酷暑。 英国和荷兰的七月份气温都创下新高，这两个国家的天气数据记录超过300年。 北半球的酷暑与美国前副总统戈尔主持的电影纪录片“烦恼的真相”不谋而合。 这部电影使用一些生动的图表、画面以及其他信息，有力地阐明了人类的二氧化碳排放造成全球气候变暖，或者至少是促进气候变暖，并且大力呼吁处理这一问题是当务之急。 美国人趋向于对道德和正义高谈阔论。 但是大多数美国人依然没有认识到他们的国家拒绝签署京都议定书、对温室气体排放采取一切照旧的做法是最为严重的道德败坏事情。 这已经给其他人造成了有害的影响，而最大的不公平就是，富人使用绝大部分导致排放的能源造成气候变化，而穷人将会承担大部分代价。 (如果想要了解自己如何做来减少气体排放，请访问网站www.climatecrisis.net ) 。 我只要看一下让我的办公室呆得住人的空调就可以知道这一不公了。 尽管我做的比市长要求的还要好，把温度设定在82华氏度(摄氏27度 ) ， 我仍然是反馈回路的一部分。 我通过使用更多的能源来对付酷热，导致燃烧更多的矿物燃料、把更多的温室气体排入大气层并且让地球更加炎热。 即使是我在观看“烦恼的真相”的时候也是如此。 那是一个炎热的晚上，电影院冷气逼人，以至于我希望我带来一件夹克。 酷热可以致命。 根据官方估计，2003年法国的一场热浪造成大约35000人死亡，上个月英国一场类似的热浪造成2000多人死亡。 尽管没有一场特别的热浪可以直接归咎于全球变暖，但是它将会让这样的事件更为频繁。 而且，如果对全球变暖继续不加以节制，那么，当降雨变得更为不规则，造成持续的干旱和严重的洪灾时所发生的死亡人数将会让欧洲炎热天气而致命的数目小巫见大巫。 更为频繁的强烈飓风将会让让更多的人死亡。 融化的极地冰川将会造成海平面上升，淹没数以亿计的人口种植粮食的低洼地带三角洲良田。 热带疾病将会扩散，让更多的人死亡。 死亡者中的绝大多数人将是那些缺乏资源适应、寻找替换食物资源以及那些没有医疗保障的人。 即使在富国，通常也不是那些富人死于自然灾害。 当卡特琳娜飓风袭击奥尔良的时候，那些遇害的人都是在低洼地带缺少汽车逃命的穷人。 如果这发生在像美国这样具有大体有效的基础设施以及在危难时候帮助其国民的资源的国家，那么，当灾难袭击发展中国家之时，由于它们的政府缺少必需的资源，而且由于富国在对外援助时并不平等看待人命，情况就会更为明显了。 根据联合国的数据，2002年美国的人均温室气体排放高出印度16倍，孟加拉国60倍，比埃塞俄比亚、马里或者乍得高出200倍以上。 排放水平接近美国的其��发达国家包括澳大利亚、加拿大以及卢森堡。 俄国、德国、英国、意大利、法国以及西班牙的排放水平都只是美国的四分之一到一半之间。 这还是比世界平均高出很多，比最贫困国家高出50倍以上。 这些国家的人死于全球气候变暖。 如果一个污染者损害了他人，受害者往往有法律救济。 例如，如果一家工厂向我用来灌溉农田的河流渗漏了有毒化学品，杀死了我的作物，那么我可以起诉工厂的主人。 如果富国用二氧化碳污染大气，让我的作物由于降雨模式改变而歉收，或者我的农田由于海平面上升而被淹没，那么，我难道就不能起诉吗？ 国际环境和发展研究所是一家总部设在伦敦的非政府组织。 今年6月份，戈尔作气候变化演讲的时候，该所主任图明也在场。 她问戈尔如何看待给那些受到气候变化打击最大、但却对气候变化作用最小的人予以补偿的问题。 她在www.opendemocracy.net网站上汇报说，这一问题让戈尔措手不及，而且他也不支持这一观点。 向图明一样，我不知道这一真相即使对戈尔来说也是太过烦恼。"

            "Will the Rumsfeld Revolution Continue? America’s defense policy is at a crossroads. Since 1997, the United States Congress has required the Department of Defense to undertake a major defense review every four years. The department is currently developing the third such review and will release it later this year. The review promises to be nothing short of a watershed. The last Quadrennial Defense Review was published a few weeks after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. As a result, it gave only hints of the counterterrorism strategy to come. The 2005 review, by contrast, will represent several years of thinking by the Bush administration, and thus will serve as a key indicator of the future course of American defense policy. The grand strategy that serves as the foundation for American defense policy has not undergone major change since 2002. Focusing on terrorism, the strategy calls for strengthening the network of international partners seeking to eradicate transnational terrorism, and for direct action against terrorist organizations and their sponsors. Ultimately, it seeks to address what President Bush considers the root causes of terrorism, particularly the absence of open political systems and economic opportunity. What is changing is the way that US military power is used to implement this grand strategy. There is little doubt that the 2005 Defense Review will formalize the change in focus underway since September 11, 2001. Before that, the American military concentrated on swift victory in a major theater war against another state’s military forces. Today, however, the US military is more likely to be used to stabilize and rebuild failed states, assist partners in countering insurgency and terrorism, control nuclear weapons when regimes collapse, or directly eradicate terrorist organizations and their supporters. This requires a different type of force, and one capable of running a marathon rather than a sprint, sustaining major deployments for extended periods. The global configuration of America’s military is also changing. The goal is to keep most of the force stationed at home in the US, with a network of lightly-manned bases abroad that can serve as forward operating locations during a crisis or war. Rather than being miniature Americas, many of these bases will be operated in conjunction with or by the host nation. This will capitalize on the US military’s ability to project force around the world quickly, while providing a more flexible and politically palatable way of doing so. But, beyond the ongoing changes, major strategic questions persist. First, how much conventional war-fighting capability should the US military retain? The goal is to maintain enough to deter aggressors, but not so much that it detracts from other, more likely missions. Second, what will America’s relationship with its traditional allies be? Will formal alliances such as NATO remain the centerpiece of American strategy, or will they be superseded by mission-specific coalitions? Third, how much should the US continue to invest in advanced, high-tech weapons more appropriate for conventional enemies than for fighting terrorists or insurgents? Systems such as the F/A-22 Raptor aircraft and the Army’s Future Combat System are extraordinarily expensive. At a time when deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan are straining the defense budget and much of the military’s existing equipment needs repair or replacement, questions arise as to whether such programs are a good investment. Fourth, what is the appropriate size of the US military? Many defense intellectuals, former military leaders, and politicians believe that America’s military, particularly the ground forces, are too small to implement Bush’s grand strategy. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, on the other hand, believes the size of the military is adequate if it is re-organized for maximum efficiency. He is also concerned that an increase in the size of the military will diminish funds available for advanced technology and systems. Because Rumsfeld is the primary architect of the upcoming defense review, it is very unlikely to recommend an increase in the size of the force. The changes underway in American defense policy reflect planning assumptions. The strategy that emerges will be only as strong as these assumptions are accurate. The upcoming defense review will mandate changes based on events of the past five years, focusing especially on Iraq, Afghanistan, and other aspects of the war on terror. The question is whether future American military missions will replicate those of the past five years. If not, the US might be preparing for the last war rather than the next one. One hopes that the 2005 Defense Review will address this issue, although it is certain to answer some strategic questions and leave others open to continued debate. In any case, the new review will serve as a roadmap for future US defense policy, thus affecting America’s partners and adversaries alike.",
            "拉姆斯菲尔德的革命会继续吗？ 美国的国防政策正处于转折点上。 自1997年以来，美国国会就要求国防部每隔四年进行一次全面的国防评估。 国防部目前正在进行第三次这样的评估，评估结果将在年底揭晓。 这项评估据称将会具有分水岭式的意义。 上一次四年一度的评估在2001年9月11日恐怖袭击以后的数周发布。 所以它只对未来的反恐战略做了些许提示。 相较之下，2005年的评估将会代表布什政府几年以来的思考成果，因而会成为美国未来国防政策的一项重要指标。 作为美国国防政策基础的大方向战略自2002年以来没有发生重大变化。 以恐怖主义为重心，该战略呼吁加强寻求根除跨国恐怖主义的国际伙伴网络，同时还呼吁对恐怖组织及其赞助者采取直接行动。 最终，这一战略的目的是要根治布什总统认为的恐怖主义发生的根源，特别是开放的政治体系和经济机遇的缺失。 正发生着变化的，是美国用于实施这一宏大战略的军事力量。 几乎可以肯定，在《2005国防评估》中会正式确认自2001年“9.11”以来的这种变化。 在此之前，美国军方的注意力主要放在针对他国军力的速战速决的做秀式的战争。 但现在，美国的军力更可能会被用来稳定和重建战败国，帮助伙伴国对抗叛乱和恐怖主义，在政权崩溃时控制核武器，或直接铲除恐怖组织及其支持者。 这就需要另一种军事力量，一种可以跑马拉松而不是100米的军事力量，以适应长期性的重要部署。 美军的全球部署也发生着变化。 其目标是将大部分的军力驻扎在美国本土，同时在国外保持驻军不多的基地网络以便在危机或战争时期作为前沿运作地点。 许多基地都会由美国和所在国一起运营，而不仅仅是作为美国的延伸。 这样就能够充分发挥美军向世界各地快速派遣军队的能力，同时也使这种做法更为灵活、更符合当今的政治潮流。 然而，在这些进行中的变化之外，重大的战略问题依然存在。 首先，美军需要保持多强的常规战斗力呢？ 目标是保持足以阻止进攻者的常规战斗力，但又不至于强到拖累其它类似使命执行的程度。 其次，美国和其传统的盟友要保持怎样的关系？ 像“北约”这样的正式联盟会依然是美国战略的核心，还是会有以具体使命为目的组成的联盟来替代它们？ 再者，相对于反恐怖和反叛乱的投入，美国还需要在应对常规敌人的先进高科技武器上多投入多少呢？ 像F/A-22“猛禽”战斗机和“未来战斗系统”等装备都极为昂贵。 在向伊拉克和阿富汗派军使美国国防预算吃紧，且许多现役设备都需要维修和更新的时候，在这些项目上投资是否明智就是值得考量了。 还有，美军的规模究竟需要多大？ 许多国防专家、前美军领导人和政治家都认为要实施布什的宏大计划，美军，特别是陆军的规模太小了。 但另一方面，国防部长拉姆斯菲尔德认为如果通过重组使效能最大化，那么美军现有的规模足够了。 他还担心扩军会使在先进技术和系统方面的投入减少。 由于拉氏是即将出台的国防评估的首要负责人，所以这份评估不大可能会建议扩大军队规模。 美国国防政策正在发生的变化反映了一些规划性的假设。 这些假设的准确度将会决定该战略的有效性。 即将出台的国防评估将会以过去五年所发生的事件，特别是以伊拉克、阿富汗和反恐战争的其它方面为基础，要求进行改革。 问题是未来的美国军事使命是否会照搬过去五年以来的先例。 如果答案是否定的，那么美国可能就会为其最后一场而��是下一场战争做准备了。 我们希望《2005国防评估》会着手解决这一问题，虽然它肯定会回答一些战略问题而将其他的留在日后商榷。 无论如何，新的评估报告会成为美国未来国防政策的路线图，从而对美国的伙伴和敌人都产生影响。"

            "Will the Sun Still Rise? TOKYO – The scale of the earthquake and tsunami that struck Japan in March was far greater than even the authorities’ worst scenarios foresaw. Nearly six months later, the total damage remains difficult to estimate. Social unrest and confusion, as well as radiation leaks from the Fukushima nuclear power plant, continue. And now the country has absorbed another huge blow: another downgrade of its bond ratings. Both Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s now rate Japanese bonds at only their fourth-highest level. So what policies should be implemented in response to these economic blows? Last year, Japan’s economy grew at a relatively healthy 3% annual rate, higher than in the United States or the European Union, owing mainly to the fiscal expansion undertaken after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008. But growth in 2011 had been predicted to slow even before the earthquake. Indeed, the economy shrank by 3.5% year on year in the first quarter. Now, with so much fixed capital and infrastructure destroyed by the earthquake and tsunami, the economy’s productive capacity has fallen by an estimated 2% of GDP. But that may not be a bad thing: Prior to the earthquake, Japan had a demand-supply gap of approximately 5% of GDP. While reducing this gap to 3% of GDP has led to higher prices, this is exactly what Japan needs after years of persistent deflation. Meanwhile, higher public spending on capital investment and other special procurements will boost domestic demand. The Hanshin earthquake in 1995 destroyed capital stock worth 2% of GDP. This time, the loss is estimated at 3.4% of GDP, implying a larger increase in domestic demand if the right public policies are pursued. On the downside, confidence among consumers and investors alike has taken a hit, mainly owing to fears about radiation leakages and power shortages. According to the Japan Center for Economic Research, power-supply disruptions could negatively affect the Japanese economy for the next three years. If the Tokyo metropolitan area’s power supply were to decrease by 10% this year, for example, Japan’s GDP would fall by 2%. Soon after the disaster, the government announced that reconstruction demand and higher prices would bring about relatively rapid economic recovery. I think this view is too optimistic, because I suspect that the government wants to finance its new expenditure with a tax hike. Moreover, the extremely sharp contraction in first-quarter GDP may indicate that the disaster’s negative impact on the economy was more significant than expected. Indeed, the economy is expected to have shrunk by another 2.6% year on year in the second quarter, with growth set to resume only in July-September. And, contrary to the government’s outlook, the start of economic recovery could be delayed until the end of this year, with medium-term annual growth reaching 1.5- 2%. A key question has been the disaster’s impact on global supply chains. According to Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry, which surveyed firms roughly a month after the earthquake, more than 60% of production sites in affected areas had already recovered as of April 15. Almost 30% expected to recover by the summer, and the remaining 10% foresaw normal operations after the autumn. But the impact of even a small number of disruptions to supply chains can be highly significant, particularly for the Asia-Pacific region. Consider Renesas Electronics, a medium-size company, with ¥150 billion ($1.9 billion) in annual sales, which accounts for more than half of worldwide production of essential micro-computing components for automobiles. Partly as a result of the damage at Renesas, Toyota’s capacity-utilization rate dropped to 50% at the beginning of May. Likewise, the chemical manufacturer Kureha (¥130 billion in annual sales) has a 70% share of the global market for adhesive materials for lithium-ion batteries – a small but essential component of cell phones. Nokia in Finland, for example, imports 12% of its cell-phone components from Japan, and thus could be indirectly affected by the disaster. As a result, more companies are likely to create and implement business continuity plans. Indeed, “BCP” is set to become a key term in the region’s economic discourse. Using BCPs to determine alternative producers means that regional economies will be integrated in a new form, with companies establishing cooperative relationships even with their competitors. Unfortunately, Japan’s public officials appear incapable of similar flexibility. The disaster confirmed the traditional view of Japan as a country that combines a dynamic private sector with an anemic public sector and central administration. The government’s mistakes in so-called “risk communication” regarding the Fukushima nuclear plant, and its slowness in getting necessary aid to people displaced by the disaster, have once again put the stereotype on full display. In terms of international relations, however, the disaster could improve Japan’s bilateral ties with influential countries. For example, Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao and South Korean President Lee Myung-bak met with outgoing Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan in Fukushima, near the damaged plant – helping to ease neighboring countries’ concerns about radiation leakage. Moreover, Japan’s relations with the US, which had suffered since the Democratic Party of Japan came to power two years ago, appear to have emerged from the disaster stronger than ever. Japan’s Self-Defense Forces played an important role in rescue and restoration activities, with about half of its 200,000 personnel dispatched to the damaged area. While this severely weakened Japan’s defenses, the US ensured East Asia’s security by deploying an aircraft carrier and cruisers, and American forces also searched for missing victims together with the JSDF. But Japan’s neighbors expect rapid reconstruction and normalization, and for that, stronger political leadership is needed. The earthquake and tsunami have confronted Japan with a profound crisis – but also with a rare opportunity to undertake the comprehensive reforms that the country has postponed for far too long.",
            "日本能否再次崛起？ 发自东京 — — 3月那场地震海啸灾难的破坏程度比日本当局的最悲观预计还要严重。 虽然灾难发生至今已近6个月，但总损失却依然无从统计。 同时社会的动荡则与福岛核电站放射性泄露一样无法遏制，愈演愈烈。 如今这个国家再遭重创，穆迪和标准普尔两大国际评级机构都将日本国债评级调整到第四高的级别。 那么面对接踵而来的经济冲击，日本又该采取何种政策应对呢？ 得益于2008年雷曼兄弟破产后采取的扩张性财政政策，去年日本经济实现了相对健康的3%年增长率，高于美国和欧盟。 但2011年的增长预计会比地震前更差。 事实上第一季度经济较去年同期下滑了3.5 % 。 如今又有如此海量的固定资产和基础设施遭到地震和海啸蹂躏，使日本企业的产能萎缩，其损失相当于2%的GDP。 但这或许并不是件坏事：地震之前日本经济已经供大于求，而供需缺口约等于GDP的5 % 。 对于长期持续遭遇通货紧缩的日本来说，缺口下降到3%并引发物价上升的状况真是求之不得。 与此同时，在资本投资和其他特殊采购项目方面的高额公共支出将刺激日本内需。 1995年的阪神大地震毁坏了相当于当年GDP2%的相关资产。 而这次的损失则想当于GDP的3.4 % ， 意味着只要推行合理的公共政策，就能更大地提升国内需求。 而负面因素则是出于对核泄漏的恐惧以及供电不足，消费者和投资者的信心也遭受重挫。 日本经济研究中心的报告认为电力短缺将影响未来三年的经济发展。 如果东京大都市圈内的电力供应在今年内下降10%的话，日本的GDP就将下滑2 % 。 灾后日本内阁府宣称重建需求和物价上涨将带来相对较快的经济复苏。 但笔者认为这个观点可能过于乐观，因为政府可能会加税来填补新的支出项目。 此外今年第一季度GDP增长的极度萎缩可能意味着灾难对经济的影响要远超预期！ 日本经济预计将在今年第二季度继续遭遇2.6%的同比下滑，直到7~9月才能恢复增长。 但相对于政府的预测，经济复苏的启动时间将推迟到年末，中期年增长率则会维持在1.5%到2%之间。 而另一个问题则关于这场灾难对全球供应链的影响。 据日本经济产业省在灾难爆发一个月后所进行的调查，受灾地区超过60%的生产场所已经在4月15日前恢复运作。 还有30%预计将在今年夏天复工，而剩下的10%则有望在秋后恢复生产。 但即便是供应链的其中一个小环节受损，所造成的影响都可能极为严重 — — 分布在亚太地区的产业链尤甚。 以日本瑞萨电子为例，这个年销售额1500亿日元（约合19亿美元）的中型企业负责为汽车提供某个必不可少的微电脑部件，供应量占全球一半以上。 由于该企业受灾，丰田汽车5月初的产能利用率下降了超过50 % 。 同样，Kureha这个年销售额1300亿日元的化工企业负责供应全球70%的锂电池黏性材料 — — 锂电池虽小，却是手机不可或缺的部件。 芬兰的诺基亚公司有12%的锂电池需要从日本进口，并因此受到了地震海啸灾害的间接影响。 因此更多日本企业都在着手制定和实施“持续经营计划 ” 。 事实上，这类计划将成为受灾区域经济的关键议题。 利用持续经营计划来确定其他的可替代供应商意味着该区域经济将以一种新的形势重新整合，而企业甚至会和自己的竞争对手建立合作关系。 但不幸的是，日本的官僚们却似乎缺乏类似的弹性。 这次大灾其实证实了一个观点：日本就是一个极富活力的私人部门与死气沉沉的公共部门与中央政府的结合体。 政府在福岛核电站事故中的所谓“危机沟通”中所犯的错误以及在救助灾民时的迟钝表现都一再印证了这个老观点。 但在国际关系方面，这场灾难将改善日本与周边主要国家的双边关系。 例如中国国家总理温家宝和韩国总统李明博最近都在福岛附近地区与时任日本首相菅直人进行了会晤 — — 也有助于缓解邻近各国对核泄漏的担忧。 此外，自从两年前日本民主党上台后就步入低谷的日美关系似乎在灾后有所巩固。 日本自卫队在灾后拯救和修复方面扮演了重要角色，派遣了全部20万兵力中的一半进入灾区。 而此举虽然严重削弱了日本的防御能力，但美国专门派遣了一艘航空母舰和巡洋舰来维护东亚安全局势，同时美军也与自卫队一道搜索灾难失踪者。 周边邻国都希望日本能尽快实现重建和经济正常化，而这意味着我们需要一个强大的政治领导。 地震和海啸无疑使日本遭遇了深刻危机 — — 但也提供了一个绝佳的契机，使其能够推行拖延已久的全面改革。"

            "Terror and the Taliban LONDON – By hastily withdrawing American troops from Afghanistan, US President Joe Biden has made a grave mistake, or so many argue. US Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, for example, has called the Taliban’s swift takeover of the country an “even worse sequel to the humiliating fall of Saigon in 1975.” That sequel, top US generals, conservatives, and even some liberals predict, will be characterized by the resurgence of transnational terrorism. The prediction is straightforward. As an Islamist militant group, the Taliban will inevitably provide al-Qaeda – and potentially other extremist groups, such as the Islamic State (ISIS) – with a sanctuary to recruit, train, and plan attacks against the West. By next month, McConnell warns, al-Qaeda and the Taliban will be celebrating the 20th anniversary of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, by “burning down [the US] embassy in Kabul.” But there is a flaw in this assessment: it assumes that there is not much daylight between the Taliban and al-Qaeda. In reality, while the two groups do share a similar religious ideology and worldview, they have very different objectives. The Taliban aims to establish a theocracy, or Islamic Emirate, in Afghanistan, but has indicated no ambition to expand beyond that country’s borders. By contrast, al-Qaeda has no national identity, nor does it recognize borders. It is a borderless movement, with branches in scores of countries worldwide, that seeks to spread its ideology near and far by any means, including violence. It is also worth noting that al-Qaeda is a shadow of its former self. Relentless US attacks have substantially degraded its ability to mount major attacks against Western targets from either Afghanistan or Pakistan. It now lacks the necessary operational capabilities. Meanwhile, transnational jihadism had metastasized well beyond Afghanistan, throughout the Middle East and into Africa and South Asia. One might counter that, with sanctuary from the Taliban, al-Qaeda could rebuild in Afghanistan. This possibility, and the security threat it poses to the West, should not be ruled out. But, for now, the group lacks the charismatic leadership and skilled cadres it would need to restore and reinvigorate its ranks. It is not even clear whether Ayman al-Zawahiri, al-Qaeda’s current (divisive) leader, is alive. More important, the Taliban are unlikely to allow al-Qaeda to establish new bases in the country immediately. At last February’s talks with then-US President Donald Trump’s administration in Doha, they promised as much, declaring that they would not allow al-Qaeda or other militants to operate in areas they controlled. This was not mere appeasement. The Taliban were describing a course of action that was – and remains – in their own interest. Over the past year, the Taliban have pursued a diplomatic “charm offensive,” talking to their bitter foes, including the Americans, Russians, and Iranians. They want to cement their control of Afghanistan and gain international recognition and legitimacy. Hosting al-Qaeda would not advance these objectives. On the contrary, it was al-Qaeda’s attack on the United States on September 11, 2001, that sent the Taliban into exile in the first place. They may be back in power, but it took 20 years, and they are not about to risk what they have regained. This is not to say that there is nothing to worry about. While the Taliban’s impressive military victory implies discipline and coherence, the movement is not politically monolithic. Rather, it comprises competing factions and clans. So, there is always the risk that some elements of the Taliban could link up with al-Qaeda and other radical groups in Pakistan. There is a precedent for this. In the late 1990s, a majority of the Taliban consultative council (its executive body) voted to expel al-Qaeda and its then-leader, Osama bin Laden, from Afghanistan, in response to international pressure. Yet the head of the movement, Mullah Omar, decided to allow bin Laden to remain, demanding only that he desist from launching attacks from Afghanistan. As the world clearly saw on 9/11, the wily Saudi played his Afghan host for a fool. So, while the Taliban is unlikely to welcome al-Qaeda with open arms, the terrorist group does have some chance of benefiting from the Taliban’s return to power. The same cannot be said of ISIS, which the Taliban fiercely opposes. In fact, the Taliban has waged a war against ISIS in the areas under its control, to neutralize any potential threat to its domination of the country. The world should not ignore the risk that Afghanistan could become a breeding ground for international terrorism. But nor should it be so fixated on this prospect – which is far less likely than many seem to believe – that it neglects the humanitarian catastrophe that is unfolding before our eyes. Images of desperate Afghans clamoring to get onto flights out of Kabul and stories of women being forced from their jobs – or worse – by Taliban fighters make it all too clear that the US and its allies have abandoned the people of Afghanistan, leaving them at the mercy of a brutal and repressive movement. America’s 20-year-old “War on Terror” is the greatest strategic disaster in the country’s modern history. It should never have been fought. And while the US has decided to cut its losses, Afghans will continue to pay an ever-higher price for it.",
            "恐怖活动和塔利班 伦敦—因为匆忙从阿富汗撤军，许多人认为，美国总统乔·拜登犯下了一个严重的错误。 美国参议院少数派领袖米奇·麦康奈尔称，塔利班迅速接管阿富汗是“比1975年西贡沦陷还要糟糕的结果 。 ” 美国高级将领、保守派甚至某些自由派人士都预测，跨国恐怖主义卷土重来将成为后续的特征。 这种预测的逻辑非常直接了当。 作为一个伊斯兰激进组织，塔利班将不可避免地为伊斯兰国（ISIS）和其他潜在的极端组织提供招募、训练和策划针对西方恐袭的庇护所。 等到下个月，麦康奈尔警告，基地组织和塔利班就将通过“烧毁[美国]驻喀布尔大使馆”来纪念发动恐袭的2001年911。 但这种评估其实存在缺陷：它假定塔利班和基地组织之间没有多少空档。 事实上，虽然这两大团体确实拥有相似的宗教意识形态和世界观，但它们却拥有截然不同的目标。 塔利班想要建立一种神权统治，或者叫伊斯兰酋长国，但却并没有超越阿富汗边境的野心和欲望。 相比之下，基地组织则没有国家身份，也不受国家边境的束缚。 它实质是一项无国界运动，在全球数十个国家都设立了分支机构，目的是以任何手段远近传播其意识形态，其中也包括策划暴力活动。 还有一点值得注意，那就是，基地组织与之前相比仅仅是个影子机构。 美国的无情打击导致其从阿富汗或巴基斯坦针对西方目标发动重大袭击的能力大幅削弱。 基地组织现在正面临必要行动能力的缺乏。 与此同时，跨国圣战主义早已传播到阿富汗以外，遍布整个中东地区并触及南亚和非洲。 有人可能会反驳，凭借塔利班的庇护，基地组织可能在阿富汗完成重建工作。 这样的可能性，以及由此为西方带来的安全威胁，不应被排除。 但就目前而言，基地组织仍然缺乏恢复和重振其队伍所需的富有魅力的领袖和娴熟的干部。 我们甚至无法确定，基地组织现任（分裂）领袖艾曼·扎瓦西里是否还活着。 更重要的是，塔利班不太可能允许基地组织立即在阿富汗国内建立新的大本营。 在去年2月与时任美国总统唐纳德·特朗普政府举行的多哈会谈中，他们已做出承诺，宣布他们不会允许基地组织或其他武装分子在其控制地区开展行动。 这并不仅仅是单纯的绥靖。 塔利班所描绘的行动方案无论过去还是现在都符合他们自身的利益。 过去一年，塔利班展开了外交“魅力攻势 ， ” 与包括美国人、俄国人和伊朗人在内的宿敌进行谈判。 他们希望巩固对阿富汗的控制，并获得国际承认及合法地位。 藏匿基地组织无益于实现这些目标。 相反，恰恰是基地组织2001年9月11日对美国发动袭击最先导致塔利班流亡。 他们或许已经重新掌权，但却耗费了整整20年时间，他们不会将到手的一切作为赌注。 但这绝不是说没有什么可以担心的。 尽管塔利班惊人的军事胜利代表着纪律和连贯性，但该运动就政治而言并非铁板一块。 相反，它包含着相互冲突的氏族和派系。 因此，塔利班某些成员与基地组织和巴基斯坦其他激进组织建立联系的风险始终存在。 这种情况其实已有过先例。 20世纪90年代末，塔利班顾问委员会（该组织的执行机构）曾迫于国际压力投票决定，将基地组织及其时任领袖奥萨马·本·拉登驱逐出阿富汗。 但该运动领导人毛拉奥马尔却决定允许本·拉登留下，仅仅要求他停止从阿富汗发动袭击。 正如全世界从911事件所明确看到的那样，狡猾的沙特人把阿富汗东道主当成了傻瓜。 因此，虽然塔利班不太可能张开怀抱欢迎基地组织，但该恐怖团体的确有机会从塔利班重新掌权中获益。 但对于塔利班强烈反对的伊斯兰国而言，情况可能就并非如此。 事实上，塔利班已经在控制区发动了一场针对伊斯兰国的战争，目的是消除对其统治国家的任何潜在威胁。 世界各国不应对阿富汗可能成为国际恐怖主义滋生地的风险视而不见。 但它也不应过度关注这一可能性 — — 这种可能性远比许多人所认为的要小得多 — — 以至于忽略了正在我们眼前发生的人道主义灾难。 绝望的阿富汗人吵着要登上离开喀布尔的飞机以及妇女在塔利班武装分子的强迫下放弃工作 — — 甚至陷入更糟糕境地的故事无不清楚地表明，美国及其盟友已经抛弃了阿富汗人民，任由他们暴露在残酷镇压运动的铁拳之下。 美国长达20年的“反恐战争”是该国现代史上规模最大的一场战略灾难。 发动这场战争从一开始就是一种误判。 虽然美国已经决心止损，但阿富汗人将继续为此付出前所未有的高昂代价。"

            "Will the US-Japan Alliance Survive? CAMBRIDGE – Next year marks the 50th anniversary of the United States-Japan Security Treaty, a central feature of stability in East Asia for half a century. But now, with the Japanese experiencing a period of domestic political uncertainty, and North Korea’s nuclear tests and missile launches increasing their anxiety, will Japan reverse its long-standing decision not to seek a national nuclear-deterrent capability? Is the US-Japan alliance coming to an end? In the early 1990’s, many Americans regarded Japan as an economic threat. Some people – in both countries – viewed the security alliance as a Cold War relic to be discarded. These trends were reversed by the Clinton administration’s 1995 “East Asia Strategy Report.” In 1996, the Clinton-Hashimoto Declaration stated that the US-Japan security alliance was the foundation for stability that would allow growing prosperity in post-Cold War East Asia. That approach has continued on a bipartisan basis in the US, and polls show that it retains broad acceptance in Japan. Most close observers of the relationship agree that the US-Japan alliance is in much better shape today than 15 years ago. Nonetheless, the alliance faces three major challenges in a new external environment. One is North Korea, whose recent behavior has been clever and deceptive. The North Koreans have violated their agreements, knowing that China, the country with the greatest potential leverage, is most concerned about regime collapse in North Korea, and thus the threat of chaos on its borders. Japan officially endorses the objective of a non-nuclear world, but it relies on America’s extended nuclear deterrent, and wants to avoid being subject to nuclear blackmail from North Korea (or China). The Japanese fear that the credibility of American extended deterrence will be weakened if the US decreases its nuclear forces to parity with China. It is a mistake, however, to believe that extended deterrence depends on parity in numbers of nuclear weapons. Rather, it depends on a combination of capability and credibility. During the Cold War, the US was able to defend Berlin because our promise to do so was made credible by the NATO alliance and the presence of American troops, whose lives would be on the line in the event of a Soviet attack. Indeed, the best guarantee of American extended deterrence over Japan remains the presence of nearly 50,000 American troops (which Japan helps to maintain with generous host-nation support). Credibility is also enhanced by joint projects such as the development of regional ballistic missile defense. Equally important are American actions that show the high priority that the US gives to the alliance, and its guarantees not to engage in what Japan fears will be “Japan-passing” in its relations with Asia. That is why it was so important that US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s first trip was to Asia, and her first stop in Japan. It is also why it is mistaken to speak of a formal G-2 with China, rather than multilateral cooperation. A second challenge for Japan is the dramatic rise of China’s economy. Although an important trade partner, China’s growing power makes Japan nervous. When re-negotiating the US-Japan security alliance in the 1990’s, Japanese leaders sometimes privately asked me if the US would desert Japan in favor of China. I responded then (and today) that there is little prospect of such a reversal, for two reasons. First, China poses a potential threat, whereas Japan does not. Second, the US shares democratic values with Japan, and China is not a democracy. Moreover, China’s internal evolution remains uncertain. While Chinese are more free today than at any time in their history, China’s political evolution has lagged behind its economic progress. Unlike India, China has not solved the problem of political participation. There is always a residual danger that China will embrace nationalism to ward off domestic problems. At the same time, it is in the interest of the US, Japan, and China that China’s rise be peaceful and harmonious (in the words of Chinese leaders). Treat China as an enemy, and you guarantee enmity. That is why the strategy of integration, plus a hedge against uncertainty, makes sense for both the US and Japan. Indeed, there are strong grounds for the US, Japan, and China to engage in areas of trilateral and other regional cooperation. Third, the US-Japan alliance will have to face a new set of transnational challenges to our vital interests, such as pandemics, terrorism, and human outflows from failed states. Chief among these challenges is the threat posed by global warming, with China having surpassed the US as the leading producer of carbon-dioxide emissions (though not in per capita terms). Fortunately, this is an area that plays to Japan’s strengths. Although some Japanese complain about the unequal nature of the alliance’s security components, owing to the limits that Japan has accepted on the use of force, in these new areas, Japan is a stronger partner. Japan’s overseas development assistance in places ranging from Africa to Afghanistan, its participation in global health projects, its support of the United Nations, its naval participation in anti-piracy operations, and its research and development on energy efficiency place it at the forefront in dealing with the new transnational challenges. Given today’s agenda, there is enormous potential for an equal partnership, working with others, in the provision of global public goods that will benefit the US, Japan, and the rest of the world. That is why I remain optimistic about the future of the US-Japan alliance.",
            "美日同盟会继续吗？ 坎布里奇 — — 明年是《美日安全条约》五十周年纪念日，半个世纪以来它一直是东亚稳定的核心特色。 但现在当日本国内政治前途未卜，北朝鲜的核试验和导弹发射又使他们更加焦虑的时候，日本会不会改变不寻求国家核威慑力的决策？ 美日同盟是否正面临解体之厄？ 20世纪90年代初，许多美国人视日本为经济威胁。 美日两国都有人认为应当作为冷战遗物摒弃安全同盟。 克林顿政府1995年的《东亚策略报告》扭转了这种趋势。 1996年，克林顿－桥本声明提出美日安全同盟为保障后冷战时期东亚日渐繁荣起到了稳定基石的作用。 这种姿态继续在美国被两大政党所接受，且民意测验显示这种观点也被日本人广泛接受。 美日关系的多数密切观察者认定，今天的美日同盟比15年健康得多。 尽管如此，同盟还是在新的外部环境中面临三大挑战。 其一是北朝鲜，它最近的举动既聪明又有欺骗性。 北朝鲜违反协定，因为他们知道潜在影响力最大的中国最担心北韩政权崩溃，进而在中朝边境上造成混乱。 日本官方赞同实现无核世界的目标，但却依赖于美国的延伸核威慑，希望避开来自北朝鲜（或中国）的核敲诈。 日本人害怕如果美国将核力量降低到与中国对等，美国延伸威慑的可信度将会减弱。 但认为延伸威慑有赖于核武器数量对等是一种误解。 相反，它取决于核能力与核信用的结合。 在冷战期间，美国能够保护柏林是因为北约联盟和美军进驻使我们的承诺真实可信，如果苏联进攻，美国士兵的生命将处在危险之中。 实际上，美国对日延伸威慑的最佳保障依然是近50，000名美军的进驻（这支部队的存在也有赖于日本慷慨的东道支持 ） 。 发展地区弹道导弹防御等联合项目也提高了同盟的可信度。 表明美国重视美日同盟的行动以及不像日本人担心的那样在对亚洲关系中“忽略日本”的保证也同等重要。 它解释了希拉里·克林顿国务卿上任后首访亚洲、而首访亚洲时又将首站定为日本为什么如此重要。 它还解释了探讨中美两国正式峰会，而不是多边合作为什么是错的。 中国经济的戏剧性崛起是日本面临的第二大挑战。 虽然是日本重要的贸易伙伴，但中国日渐强大的力量令日本感到不安。 20世纪90年代重新谈判美日安全同盟时，日本领导人有时私下问我美国是否会抛弃日本转而与中国交好。 我当时回答说发生这种逆转的可能性极小（现在我的回答还是一样 ） ， 原因有两个。 第一，中国会带来潜在威胁，而日本不会。 第二，美日之间拥有共同的民主价值观，而中国不是民主国家。 此外，我们也无法确定中国的内部变化。 尽管今天的中国比历史上任何时候都更加自由，但中国的政治改革已经落后于经济发展。 和印度不同的是，参政问题在中国并没有得到解决。 因此中国借民族主义逃避国内问题的危险永远存在着。 与此同时，中国和平和谐（用中国领导人的话说）的崛起符合美、日、中三方的利益。 把中国当成敌人注定会收获仇恨。 这也解释了融合策略，再加上对不确定性防范，为什么适用于美日两国。 实际上，美国、日本和中国有充分的理由在三边及其他地区合作中互相配合。 第三，美日同盟将不得不面对传染病、恐怖主义和失败国家人口流出等对我们根本利益的新一轮跨国挑战。 在这些挑战中居于首要地位的是全球变暖，中国已经超越美国成为二氧化碳第一大排放国（虽然从人均角度衡量并非如此 ） 。 幸运的是，这个领域是日本的强项。 尽管某些日本人由于日本接受了运用武力的限制条款而抱怨同盟安全条款不平等，但在这些新领域中，日本是更强有力的伙伴。 日本的海外发展援助遍及从非洲到阿富汗的各个角落，它对全球健康计划的支持、对联合国的支持、派海军参与打击海盗行动、以及它在能效方面的研发工作使其处在应对新跨国挑战的前沿。 在今天的大背景下，建立平等的伙伴关系、为全球公共利益相互合作从而使美、日和世界其他国家从中受益的潜力巨大。 这也解释了我为什么对美日同盟的未来持乐观态度。"

            "Can Trump’s Sanctions Break Iran? LONDON – “The Iran sanctions have officially been cast,” tweeted US President Donald Trump three months after he signed an executive order in May announcing his administration’s withdrawal from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. He went on to boast the return of “the most biting sanctions ever imposed,” as if sounding the death knell of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), as the deal is officially known. The announcement took few observers by surprise. But the irony was not lost on Wendy Sherman, the JCPOA’s senior US negotiator, who quipped recently that she had always expected “the greatest challenge to the deal’s success would be violations by Iran, not the political machinations of the president of the United States.” Indeed, Iran and the US seem to have reversed roles: Iran’s isolation before the deal now contrasts with America’s determination to swim against the global tide. Disappointment, if not disbelief, prevailed among the JCPOA’s other parties – the European Union countries, Russia, and China – whose leaders were quick to reaffirm their strong commitment to the agreement. By contrast, US officials have reiterated the Trump administration’s determination permanently to rein in Iran’s “nuclear ambitions,” limit its ballistic missiles program, and scale down its regional influence. By the sanctions’ final stage, which kicks in on November 4 (coinciding, as it happens, with the 39th anniversary of the abduction of diplomats and staff at the US Embassy in Tehran in 1979), the US goal is to reduce Iran’s oil exports “down to zero.” Given the long and fraught history of economic sanctions against Iran, the question looming now is whether this time they are more likely to be effective in changing the regime or its behavior. The last time Iran’s oil exports were reduced to negligible levels through an extensive economic boycott was in the mid-twentieth century, when Iran’s popularly elected prime minister, Mohammad Mossadegh, nationalized the oil industry. A British-led blockade of Iran’s oil brought the industry to a virtual standstill, destabilized the economy, and paved the way for the infamous US and UK-instigated coup which restored the Shah to power in 1953. Such has been the hangover from those tumultuous years that it took a half-century for US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to acknowledge in 2000 that the coup that ousted Mossadegh was a clear “setback for Iran’s political development” and a key reason “why many Iranians continue to resent this intervention by America.” Such remorse, if it can be considered that, did not, however, close the door on more sanctions against Iran. Sanctions imposed by the US and the EU from 2010 to 2015 had mixed results. These comprehensive measures – described by then-US Vice President Joe Biden as “the most crippling sanctions in the history of sanctions,” shrank oil exports by two-thirds, to below one million barrels a day. The resulting stagflation heaped misery on ordinary Iranians, with GDP contracting almost 6% in 2012 and inflation averaging 35% the following year. Widespread private-sector failures and growing unemployment followed. Contrary to the sanctions’ principal objectives, however, the economic and political hold of the public sector and parastatal organizations strengthened. Meanwhile, Iran insisted on its sovereign right to pursue a peaceful nuclear program. The scope for compromise seemed absent until the reformist administration of President Hassan Rouhani took over in 2013. So what is different this time? Though promising to be even more biting, the US sanctions regime is not backed by UN Security Council resolutions and hence lacks international legitimacy. This means Iran’s isolation will be far less complete, with key trading partners such as China and Turkey already announcing that they will abide by “legal” sanctions only. But the sanctions’ de facto, not de jure, status will determine their effectiveness. This is especially true of European firms, which will ultimately decide the outcome of the battle for secondary sanctions in cognizance of their shareholders’ interests, rather than the political machinations of their governments. This explains the significant stream of exits from Iran’s markets already announced by large firms. In an interconnected world where US economic influence extends far and wide, it is hard even for European firms – auto manufacturers, airlines, energy companies, banks, and the like – to risk the ire of the US Treasury. This means that the ultimate success of sanctions is likely to depend on what others make of them as much as on what Iran does. But domestic conditions in Iran also play a key role, and it is here that the US seems to be basing its confidence that sanctions will “succeed.” For months, Iranian cities have been rocked by widespread protests, ostensibly against worsening economic conditions. These outbursts have weakened Iran’s reformers by undermining their monopoly on hope. Hardliners, it seems, have been offered a new lease on life and can now claim their dismissal of the JCPOA was justified from the start. The economic impact has already been felt, with the Iranian currency going into freefall after speculation about a US withdrawal from the deal began. The specter of inflation is back. Ultimately, for sanctions to succeed from the US perspective, they must bring about either regime change or behavioral change. Historically, sanctions have a less-than-convincing track record (think Cuba, Myanmar, and Zimbabwe) on achieving the former, and whether they can pave the way for the latter, in the form of a negotiated settlement, remains to be seen. But one thing is clear: applied to Iran, the “Trump doctrine” of pushing one’s foes to the brink, in the hope that they will blink first, has entered uncharted terrain.",
            "特朗普的制裁能击垮伊朗吗？ 伦敦 — “ 伊朗制裁已经正式开始 ， ” 美国总统特朗普在5月份签署宣布其政府退出2015年伊核协议之后三个月发推特说。 他接着夸耀恢复了“史上最严厉制裁 ” ， 好像已经敲响了联合全面行动计划（JCPOA，伊核协议的正式名称）的警钟。 特朗普如此宣布并没有让观察者们意外。 但JCPOA的美国资深谈判员温迪·谢尔曼（Wendy Sherman）突显出其讽刺之处，她最近从这个她一直认为“取得成功最大的挑战将来自伊朗违规，而非美国总统的政治诡计”的协议中辞职。 事实上，伊朗和美国似乎发生了角色颠倒：协议签订前是伊朗被孤立，这与美国逆全球潮流而动形成鲜明对比。 JCPOA的其他各方 — — 欧盟国家、俄罗斯和中国 — — 无不感到失望甚至信念破碎，这些国家的领导人很快就重申将强烈支持伊核协议。 相反，美国官员重申特朗普决心要永久封杀伊朗的“核野心 ” ， 限制其弹道导弹计划，并削弱其地区影响力。 至于始于11月4日（恰巧正逢1979年美国驻德黑兰大使馆外交官和工作人员被绑架39周年）的制裁第一阶段，目标是将伊朗石油出口削减“到零 ” 。 从漫长又令人心忧的伊朗经济制裁史看，现在的问题是这一次的制裁在改变伊朗体制或行为方面是否可能奏效。 上一次通过全面经济抵制让伊朗石油出口下降到可忽略水平是在二十世纪中叶，当时，伊朗深孚众望的当选总理摩萨德实施了石油工业国有化。 英国发动的抵制伊朗是有运动让伊朗石油业几乎停滞，经济陷入动荡，也为美国和英国煽动臭名昭著的1953年沙复辟政变铺平了道路。 这些骚动年代的余波让半个世纪后的美国国务卿奥尔布赖特在2000年时承认推翻摩萨德的政变显然是“伊朗政治发展的倒退 ” ， 也是“大量伊朗人憎恨美国干预”的关键原因。 但如此懊悔也没能阻止对伊朗采取更多制裁。 2010—2015年间美国和欧盟所施加的制裁效果喜忧参半。 这些全面措施 — — 时任美国副总统拜登称之为 “制裁史上最令人窒息的制裁 ” — —让伊朗石油出口量减少了三分之二，至每天一百万桶以下。 由此导致的滞涨让普通伊朗老百姓不堪重负，2012年，GDP收缩了6 % ， 第二年，平均通胀达到了 35 % 。 私人部门的大量破产和不断升高的失业接踵而至。 但与制裁的主要目标背道而驰的是，公共部门和准政府组织的经济和政治控制力不降反升。 与此同时，伊朗坚持发展和平核计划的主权权利。 直到2013年伊朗改革派总统鲁哈尼上台，才有了妥协空间。 那么，这一次有什么不同？ 尽管美国的制裁号称更加严厉，但并没有联合国安理会决议的支持，因此不具有国际合法性。 这意味着伊朗并非完全孤立，中国和土耳其等重要贸易伙伴都已宣布只配合“合法的”制裁。 但制裁的实际而非法律地位才是决定其效果的因素。 对于欧洲企业来说尤其如此，其股东的利益，而非政府的政治诡计，才是决定二级制裁（secondary sanctions）的结果的因素。 这解释了为何大量大企业宣布退出伊朗市场。 在这个美国经济影响力大得多、广得多的联动世界，即便是欧洲企业 — — 汽车制造商、航空公司、能源公司、银行等 — — 也不敢冒险触怒美国财政部。 这意味着制裁的最终成功不但取决于伊朗做什么，也依赖于其他国家怎么做。 但伊朗的国内情况也起着重要作用，而美国认为制裁将“成功”的信心基础也在这里。 几个月来，伊朗各大城市爆发了广泛的示威，表面上看，是因为经济情况的恶化。 这些示威的爆发破坏了伊朗改革派对希望垄断，削弱了他们的地位。 强硬派赢得喘息之机，现在，他们可以宣称他们对JCPOA的抵制从一开始就是正确的。 经济影响已经能够深切感受到，自人们开始猜测美国将推出伊核协议以来，伊朗货币价值暴跌。 通胀的幽灵卷土重来。 最终，从美国角度要让制裁成功，必须实现政权更迭或行为改变。 历史上，制裁对前者的效果十分有限（想想古巴、缅甸和津巴布韦 ） ， 至于能否为后者（以商定和解为标志）奠定基础仍有待观察。 但有一件事是清楚的：在伊朗身上，将敌人逼到墙角希望其就范的“特朗普主义”已经进入了未知领域。"

            "Will Putin's War Slow China's Growth? CHICAGO – On March 5, China announced a GDP growth target for this year of about 5.5%, the lowest target since 1991. But that should not come as a surprise. In 2013, World Bank economists and the Chinese State Council projected that China’s annual growth rate would decline to 5% by 2030. This may still be an overestimate, given that growth rates during 2010-16 have been found to be inflated by 1.8 percentage points and that average growth in OECD economies is around 3%. Back then, economists and policymakers also accurately predicted the main challenges to long-run growth in China, including increasing inequality, corruption, an aging population, inefficiency in large and often state-owned firms, and pollution. But no one could have foreseen the additional significant economic uncertainty stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic and now Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The pandemic has severely disrupted supply chains and pushed up prices everywhere. China is particularly worried about rising food prices, because the country is a net importer of food, with the bill totaling $133 billion in 2019. Supply problems and bad weather caused the price of vegetables in Chinese cities to increase by 30.6% year on year in November 2021. The price of eggs, a major source of protein for the middle class, rose by 20.1% over the same period. China’s other main concern is the cost of energy, because it is also a net importer of coal, natural gas, and crude oil. Increased demand from Chinese factories resuming production during the post-pandemic economic recovery contributed to further increases in the prices of energy commodities. Chinese regulators responded by increasing the cap on subsidized electricity prices. But this was insufficient to offset the losses to electricity generators as coal prices and domestic demand continued to rise. As a consequence, power plants in several northeastern provinces shut down in September 2021, leading to sudden mass power outages and a cascade of economic and social disruptions. The Chinese government has since increased the price cap even more and boosted domestic production of coal, using its large reserves. But China’s reserves of other energy sources are limited, and demand for energy is likely to continue to rise. These economic concerns, along with a desire to present a common front against the United States, help to explain China’s commitment to the “no limits” relationship with Russia that President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin proclaimed in early February. Energy is the economic centerpiece of Sino-Russian relations. In 2019, fuel accounted for about 17%, or $344 billion, of China’s total imports of $2.1 trillion. Russia has been the biggest crude oil exporter to China since 2016, and is its fastest-growing supplier of natural gas. Twelve percent of all Chinese oil and gas imports now come from Russia. To meet domestic energy demand and moderate its greenhouse-gas emissions, China plans to increase the share of natural gas in its primary energy consumption to 15% by 2030. Russia holds nearly a quarter of the world’s gas reserves and is the largest exporter. The two countries therefore agreed last month to a long-term contract under which Russian gas exports to China will increase to 48 billion cubic meters, or nearly 10% of China’s predicted gas consumption of 526 billion cubic meters, by 2025. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and the subsequent Western-led economic and financial sanctions imposed on Russia, has suddenly cast a shadow of uncertainty over these plans. Besides exacerbating existing supply-chain disruptions, the wide-ranging sanctions have made it difficult for Chinese firms to operate in Russia. Most importantly, the war involves two of the largest global exporters of food and energy. Ukraine and Russia together account for 28% of world grain exports, and wheat futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange have soared by more than 50% since the invasion. Similarly, oil, gas, and coal prices have surged due to supply disruptions and the sanctions against Russia. These inflationary pressures could have potentially devastating effects on the Chinese population, as well as on the country’s manufacturers. But the Chinese government’s neutral political stance toward the Russia-Ukraine war may also yield economic payoffs if China becomes more important to Russia without overly offending major Western trading partners such as the US and Australia. Russian food exports in 2021 totaled $38 billion, of which $4.7 billion went to the European Union. So, Chinese food-price inflation could be moderated if EU sanctions cause Russia to divert some of its food exports to China on favorable terms. Similarly, China is likely to gain more favorable terms for its energy imports as the war continues and other countries reduce their purchases of Russian oil and gas. The US has banned imports of Russian oil, and other countries are likely to follow suit. Likewise, the EU plans to reduce its reliance on Russian natural gas by two-thirds this year and seek alternative suppliers and energy sources to compensate. While the switch away from gas will take time, it seems inevitable that Russia will need to look for other buyers soon. Given that oil and gas accounted for 60% of Russia’s exports and generated 39% of its federal budget revenue in 2019, China will be in a strong bargaining position. Ultimately, the Russia-Ukraine war’s impact on the Chinese economy will depend on the duration of the conflict and the extent of the devastation that it causes in Ukraine and Russia, and other parts of the global economy. It will also depend on how much goodwill remains between China and Ukraine’s Western allies when the fighting stops. Clearly, 2022 will be a year of uncertainty in which China has limited control over its rate of economic growth. New risks arising from the war in Eastern Europe have compounded the challenges that policymakers anticipated owing to the slow and uneven post-pandemic recovery. At this point, how China and the rest of the global economy will fare in the coming months is anyone’s guess.",
            "普京的战争会减缓中国的增长吗？ 芝加哥—3月5日，中国宣布今年GDP增长目标为5.5 % ， 是1991年以来的最低目标。 但这不足为奇。 2013年，世界银行经济学家和中国国务院预测到2030年中国年增长率将降为5 % 。 这可能仍然高估了，因为2010-16年增长率被注水 1.8个百分点，而经合组织经济体平均增长率在3%左右。 当时，经济学家和政策制定者还准确地预计了中国长期增长的主要挑战，包括不平等性加剧、腐败、人口老龄化、大型（通常是）国有企业低效率和污染等。 但没人能够遇见到来自新冠疫情和眼下俄罗斯入侵乌克兰等重大经济不确定性。 疫情严重破坏了供给链，推高了各地物价。 中国尤其担心粮食价格上涨，因为中国是粮食净进口国，2019年粮食进口总值为1330亿美元。 2021年11月，供给问题和坏天气导致中国城市蔬菜价格同比上涨30.6 % 。 同期，中产阶级蛋白质主要来源之一的鸡蛋价格上涨20.1 % 。 中国的另一个主要担忧是能源价格，因为中国也是煤炭、天然气和原油净进口国。 中国工厂预计疫情后经济复苏将带来产量增加，这导致需求增加，进一步提高了能源商品价格。 中国监管部门的应对之策是提高补贴电价限额。 但这不足以抵消煤炭价格和内需不断增加所导致的发电厂的损失。 结果，2021年9月东北多省电厂关闭，导致突然大面积停电，造成一连串经济和社会动荡。 中国政府随后进一步提高限价，并提升国内煤炭产量，动用庞大的储备。 但中国其他能源资源的储备有限，而能源需求可能继续增加。 这些经济问题，再加上渴望构建反美共同战线，有助于解释中国国家主席习近平与俄罗斯总统普京在今年2月初宣布的“无限”关系。 能源是中俄关系的经济命脉。 2019年，能源在中国2.1万亿美元的进口总额中占大约17 % ， 或3440亿美元。 自2016年以来，俄罗斯一直是中国最大的原油进口国，也是增长最快的天然气供应国。 目前中国石油和天然气进口的12%来自俄罗斯。 为了满足国内能源需求，缓解温室气体排放，中国计划到2030年将天然气在初级能源消费的比重增加到15% 。 俄罗斯掌握了全世界近四分之一的天然气储量，也是天然气的最大出口国。 中俄两国在上个月达成一项长期合同，到2050年，俄罗斯对华天然气出口将增至480亿立方米，接近中国5260亿立方米的预计天然气消耗量的10% 俄罗斯入侵乌克兰，以及随后西方领导的对俄经济和金融制裁，猛然间给这些计划蒙上了一层阴影。 除了加剧已有供给链干扰，全面制裁还让中国企业难以在俄经营。 最重要的是，这场战争涉及到全球最大的两个粮食和能源出口国。 乌克兰和俄罗斯加起来占了全球谷物出口量的28 % ， 芝加哥商品交易所小麦期货自入侵以来已上涨超50 % 。 类似地，石油、天然气和煤炭价格也因为供给链干扰和对俄制裁而飙涨。 这些通胀压力可能已经对中国人以及中国制造商产生了破坏性影响。 但中国政府对俄乌战争的中立政治立场可能产生经济收益，如果中国对俄罗斯变得更加重要，又没有过度触怒美国和澳大利亚等西方贸易伙伴的话。 2021年俄罗斯粮食出口总额为380亿美元，其中47亿美元流向欧盟。 因此，如果欧盟制裁导致俄罗斯以有利条件将一些粮食出口到中国的话，中国粮食价格通胀可能有所缓解。 类似地，随着战争的继续和其他国家削减俄罗斯石油天然气采购量，中国可能获得更加有利的能源进口条件。 美国已禁止进口俄罗斯石油，其他国家可能跟进。 类似地，欧盟计划减少今年将对俄天然气依赖程度减少三分之二，寻找其他供应方和能源资源作为补偿。 远离天然气需要时间，但俄罗斯必然很快就需要寻找新的买家。 鉴于石油和天然气占了俄罗斯出口的60 % ， 贡献了2019年俄联邦预算收入的39 % ， 中国将获得相当好的讨价还价地位。 说到底，俄乌战争对于中国经济的影响取决于冲突持续多久，对乌克兰和俄罗斯，以及全球经济其他部分造成的破坏多大；也取决于战斗停止时中国和乌克兰的西方盟友还能保持多大善意。 显然，2022年将是不确定之年，中国对于其经济增长率控制力有限。 疫情后复苏的缓慢和不均衡让政策制定者预料到了挑战，而源于东欧战事的新风险加剧了挑战。 此时此刻，中国和全球经济其他部分未来几个月的前景完全是未知数。"

            "Xi Jinping’s Choice LONDON – For Chinese President Xi Jinping, the initial response to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s brutal war on Ukraine must have seemed a no-brainer. It is almost inconceivable that these two self-proclaimed kindred spirits had not discussed Putin’s invasion plans at their early February meeting in Beijing, just before the start of the Winter Olympics. After all, had Putin duped Xi, what would that tell Xi about the Kremlin’s dependability as an ally, and what would it say about Xi’s diplomatic skills? All that Putin had to do in return for Xi’s connivance, it seems, was to postpone sending his tanks into Ukraine until the Beijing Games were over. Russian bombs and rockets thus began blasting Ukraine’s cities and people four days after the curtain came down on the spectacle in China, and when the United Nations Security Council met shortly afterward, Xi kept his side of the bargain: China abstained on the vote to censure Russia. At the UN and since, China has argued that Russia was not guilty of an “invasion,” a word apparently freighted with suggestions that Russia had committed an international crime. Nonetheless, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi dug out of China’s diplomatic toolbox the principle of peaceful coexistence that it embraced in 1955, telling us that China always insisted on national sovereignty and non-intervention in other countries’ internal affairs. That, he added, of course included Ukraine, a country with which China had a strong trading relationship (and which provided the ship that China transformed into its first aircraft carrier). China also included Ukraine in its Belt and Road Initiative, which finances large-scale infrastructure investment in member countries. The outcome of Russia’s “non-invasion” has so far not been what Putin had probably promised Xi at their February meeting, when the two leaders had gone out of their way to prove that they were, as an old Chinese saying puts it, as close as lips and teeth. In Ukraine, Putin has killed, maimed, and destroyed, but he has failed to secure a swift victory. The world, remembering earlier Russian-directed carnage in Grozny and Aleppo, knows all too well that Putin is a master at murderous mayhem. But although many Ukrainians have died defending their homeland, there have also been thousands of Russian casualties – many of them young conscripts who were plainly conned into thinking they would be welcomed in Ukraine as liberators. So, what sort of “victory,” if any, awaits Putin? In the second century BCE, the Roman Republic fought a war against its North African rival Carthage with the stated objective of destroying the city. The Romans, with whom I certainly do not seek to compare Putin, were as good as their word, reducing Carthage to rubble. They behaved the same way elsewhere, including in Scotland. The great historian Tacitus quoted a Caledonian chieftain who opposed Rome’s legions as saying, “They slaughter and they steal […] And where they make a wasteland, they call it peace.” If Ukraine suffers a similar fate, as Putin seemingly intends, will the surviving Ukrainians be content to live in a Kremlin-created wasteland as happy Russian serfs? The consequences for Putin – and, alas, for Russia – also will be awful, and they will not be much better for those seen to be helping the Kremlin or even just keeping their heads down and avoiding any criticism of Russia’s new czar. It would be more than embarrassing if allegations that China has been considering selling arms to Russia to help its war effort turned out to be true. Plainly, some Chinese communists have begun to realize the difficulty of the diplomatic tightrope that Xi’s alliance with Putin is making them walk. Specifically, how can Chinese policymakers keep their friend in the Kremlin happy without demonstrating to the world that they are accomplices to war crimes? This balancing act raises serious doubts about China’s ability to pose as the world’s peacemaker for the foreseeable future. Moreover, while China may be able to buy Russian gas and oil at a bargain because Putin can no longer sell it to the West, the Chinese probably will not be well served by a global economy splintered and distorted by sanctions. Then there is Taiwan. Will any potential Chinese invasion of the island look easier for Xi now that Western democracies have learned the lessons of their earlier failure to confront Putin? An influential Shanghai-based academic commentator on international affairs, Hu Wei, recently advanced a cautionary argument that has been circulated widely in Chinese-language publications. In his commentary, which is unlikely to have been published without the approval of some of Xi’s senior courtiers, Hu wondered how Chinese communists would react if the war escalated beyond Ukraine, or if Russia was clearly defeated. How, Hu asked, would China respond to a revival of US leadership of a more united West and to the reinvigoration of the international agreements and organizations that China dislikes? What is the likelihood that a new Iron Curtain emerges, cutting off Russia and China from the world’s democracies? How could China avoid isolation? It would, Hu concluded, “not only be encircled militarily but also challenged by Western values and systems.” For Hu, the answer for China’s leaders is simple. They should wash their hands of the relationship with Putin, which Wang described only recently as “ironclad” and Xi previously called “better than an alliance.” The problem for China’s leaders, which they must now realize, is that one must be careful about the company one keeps. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine will not produce more grain to feed the Chinese after the poor harvest predicted for their country this year. Nor will it replace the markets that China now risks losing in Europe and elsewhere because of its perceived closeness to the Kremlin. Instead, Putin’s war risks irreparably damaging China’s global image and its prospects of being a potential leader in international affairs. Xi cannot fudge the issue indefinitely. Is China a collaborator and accomplice in Putin’s terrible crime, or can it become a responsible stakeholder in a peaceful and prosperous world?",
            "习近平的选择 伦敦—对中国国家主席习近平而言，对俄罗斯总统弗拉基米尔·普京对乌克兰发动残酷战争的最初反应似乎是不费吹灰之力的。 这两位自称志同道合的同志在2月初举行的北京会议上，就在冬奥会开幕之前，没有讨论过普京的入侵计划几乎是不可思议的。 毕竟，如果普京欺骗了习，那么，克里姆林宫作为盟友的可靠性会给习留下什么样的印象，而且对习的外交技巧又会作何评价？ 为换取习的纵容，普京所要做的似乎就是推迟将坦克开进乌克兰，直到北京奥运会结束。 于是，在中国的精彩表演落幕4天后，俄罗斯的炸弹和火箭开始轰炸乌克兰的城市和民众。 而当联合国安理会不久后召集会议时，习近平信守了自己的承诺：中国在谴责俄罗斯的问题上投了弃权票。 自此之后在联合国，中国一直辩称俄罗斯并未犯“入侵”罪，上述字眼显然意味着俄罗斯犯下了某种国际罪行。 尽管如此，中国外长王毅还是从中国的外交工具箱中挖出了该国于1955年开始奉行的和平共处原则，告诉我们，中国始终坚持奉行国家主权和不干涉其他国家的内部事务。 该原则，他补充道，当然包括乌克兰，该国与中国的贸易关系非常牢固（中国的首艘航空母舰系由该国提供给中国的船只所改造 ） 。 中国还将乌克兰纳入其一带一路计划，该计划出资在各成员国进行大规模基础设施建设。 迄今为止，俄罗斯“非入侵”的结果可能并不是普京在二月会晤时向习所承诺的那样，当时两位领导人竭尽全力证明，他们的关系，就像中国古语所说的那样，是唇亡齿寒的。 在乌克兰，普京杀戮、残害、摧毁，但却未能迅速获胜。 世界各国还记得早前俄罗斯在格罗兹尼和阿勒颇所指挥的大屠杀，对于普京是制造混乱的凶残大师这一事实都再清楚不过。 尽管许多乌克兰人为保卫家园而牺牲，但也有成千上万的俄罗斯人伤亡 — — 其中许多人是年轻的应征者，他们显然被哄骗以为自己在乌克兰会受到欢迎，扮演解放者的角色。 那么，如果要说“胜利 ， ” 究竟什么样的胜利等待着普京呢？ 在公元前二世纪，罗马共和国与其北非对手迦太基进行了一场以摧毁这座城市为既定目标的战争。 我当然不愿将罗马人与普京进行比较，他们言出必行，把迦太基变成了一片瓦砾。 他们在包括苏格兰在内的其他地方也有过同样的行为。 伟大的历史学家塔西佗引述了一位反对罗马军团的喀里多尼亚酋长的话 ， “ 他们屠杀，他们偷盗 [ … ]他们把一块地方变成废墟，然后他们称和平实现了 。 ” 如果乌克兰像普京看似期望的那样遭遇到类似的命运，那么幸存下来的乌克兰人会否满足于像俄罗斯农奴一样快乐地生活在克里姆林宫所制造的废墟上？ 对普京 — — 哎，对俄罗斯 — — 来讲后果也将同样可怕，而且对于那些被视为帮助克里姆林宫或者甚至仅仅是低下头避免批评俄罗斯新沙皇的人而言，结果也不会好到哪里去。 如果有关中国一直在考虑向俄罗斯出售武器以协助其作战的指控被证明属实，那将是极为尴尬的。 显而易见，某些中国共产党人已经开始认识到，习与普京缔结的联盟导致其所走外交钢丝的难度。 具体而言，中国决策者如何在不向世界证明自己是战争罪帮凶的情况下，依然能让克里姆林宫的朋友们开心？ 这种平衡行为引发了对中国在可以预见的未来成为世界和平缔造者能力的严重怀疑。 此外，虽然因为普京不能继续出售给西方，中国能够以便宜的价格购买俄罗斯的石油和天然气，但因制裁而被扭曲和四分五裂的全球经济可能并不真正符合中国的利益。 然后还有台湾问题。 现在西方民主国家已经吸取了早前未能对抗普京的教训，那么，对习而言，任何潜在的中国对台湾岛的入侵是否会变得更加容易？ 一位颇具影响力的上海国际事务学术评论者胡伟最近提出了一种警示性的论点，该论点在中文期刊上流传甚广。 这篇评论如果未经习的某些高级朝臣批准不太可能发表，在这篇评论中，胡想知道，如果战争升级到乌克兰之外，或者如果俄罗斯被明显击败，中国共产党人会采取何种应对行动。 胡问道，如果美国重新领导一个更加团结的西方，并且重振中国所不喜欢的国际协议和机构，中国将采取何种应对行动？ 新版铁幕出现，将中国和俄罗斯与世界民主国家隔绝的几率有多大？ 中国应如何避免陷入孤立的状况？ 胡得出结论，出现这种状况“不仅会在军事上陷入包围，而且还会遭到西方价值观和制度的挑战 。 ” 在胡看来，中国领导人的答案是非常简单的。 他们应当放弃与普京的关系，仅仅不久前王还形容这种关系是“无懈可击的 ” ， 习此前也曾形容这种关系“比结盟还好 。 ” 中国领导人现在必须认识到它他们必须谨慎交友。 俄罗斯入侵乌克兰将无法生产出更多的粮食来养活中国人，因为他们的国家预计今年会欠收。 它同样也无法替代中国现在可能因为与克里姆林宫关系密切而失去的欧洲和其他地方的市场。 相反，普京的战争可能会无可挽回地损害中国成为国际事务潜在领袖的前景以及中国的全球形象。 习在这个问题上蒙混过关不可能是无限期的。 中国究竟是普京可怕罪行的合作者和帮凶，亦或是在和平与繁荣世界中成为负责任的利益相关方？"

            "Renminbi Rising? SHANGHAI – China is increasingly debating whether or not the renminbi should be internationalized, possibly joining the US dollar and the euro as an international vehicle currency (IVC) – that is, a currency that other countries use to denominate the prices of their traded goods and international loans. Related to this is a debate about whether Shanghai can become a first-tier international financial center (1-IFC) like London and New York. Financial history can help to answer these questions. First, a city can become a 1-IFC only if its national currency is an IVC. But, as London’s status shows, a longtime 1-IFC can retain its position in the international financial system even if its currency is no longer an IVC. Second, the transaction cost of using a foreign currency as a medium of exchange is inversely proportional to the extent to which that currency is used globally. Similar economies of scale characterize foreign investors’ use of a particular international financial center. As a result, there cannot be more than three or four IVCs and 1-IFCs. Third, a country’s financial sector must be both open, with no capital-flow restrictions, and sophisticated, with a wide range of instruments and institutions. It must also be safe, with a central bank maintaining economic stability, prudential regulators keeping fraud and speculation in check, macro-prudential authorities displaying adequate financial fire-fighting capabilities, and a legal system that is predictable, transparent, and fair. Last – and most important – successful convergence to IVC and 1-IFC status requires the national economy to be strong relative to other economies for a substantial period of time. The United Kingdom occupied a position of global economic leadership for more than a century. In 1914, the US/UK GDP ratio was 2.1, but the US dollar was not an IVC, suggesting that America’s relative economic strength was inadequate. A decade later, in 1924, the ratio was 3.2 and rising – and the US dollar had eclipsed the British pound as the most important IVC. Relative economic strength explains why the Japanese yen failed to develop into an IVC, and why Tokyo – whose financial markets satisfied the relevant requirements – failed to become a 1-IFC. With its GDP reaching only about 60% of America’s at its peak in 1991, Japan never attained the critical mass required to induce foreigners to use the yen to lower transaction costs. Determining the future international status of the renminbi and Shanghai must begin with a calculation of China’s expected relative economic strength vis-à-vis the US under two plausible scenarios. In the first scenario, China becomes caught in a middle-income trap, with per capita GDP stuck at 30% of America’s – an outcome that has characterized Latin America’s five largest economies since at least 1960, and Malaysia since 1994. This would put China’s economic strength relative to the US at 1.1 – well below the necessary ratio. In the second, more favorable scenario, China’s per capita GDP would reach 80% of America’s – higher than the 70% average rate for the five largest Western European countries since 1960 – and its economic strength relative to the US would amount to roughly 2.8. This would make the renminbi eligible for IVC status and enable Shanghai to choose whether to become a 1-IFC. But China’s economy still would not be strong enough relative to the US for natural market forces to ensure the renminbi’s international success. Given this, the Chinese government would have to implement decisive measures to encourage international traders and creditors to price their transactions in renminbi. Specifically, China would have to use its market power to promote pricing in renminbi for relevant manufactured exports and raw-material imports, and encourage renminbi denomination of foreign financial assets that China purchases (which the country’s status as a net creditor should facilitate). But there are serious pitfalls to avoid in this process. As the Asian financial crisis of 1997-1998 demonstrated, capital-account liberalization could lead to financial meltdowns – a danger that opponents of internationalizing the renminbi often cite. But these risks do not outweigh the potential benefits of financial openness, and they can be minimized with effective monitoring and regulation, including requirements for large capital buffers and low leverage ratios, together with strong crisis-response mechanisms, like a resolution trust corporation. In fact, effective financial-monitoring and prudential-regulation systems do not have to precede opening the capital account. On the contrary, developing and enacting financial regulation must be a gradual process, shaped by both existing knowledge and firsthand experience. After all, no financial market is either completely open or completely closed forever; the degree of openness at a given moment depends on policy choices. The recent establishment of the Shanghai Free Trade Zone will allow for the emergence of an offshore international financial center that offers real-world training to China’s regulators. This will give them the tools they need to recognize the signs of a developing crisis, defuse the threat, and efficiently handle the recapitalization and reorganization of failed financial institutions. China’s pursuit of an IVC and a 1-IFC city would serve not only its own interests. Allowing the renminbi to help meet global demand for international reserves and risk diversification would also strengthen global financial stability. There is little time to waste in internationalizing the renminbi. Given the limited number of currencies that can serve as IVCs, the failure of the renminbi to achieve IVC status before, say, the Indian rupee, the Russian ruble, or the Brazilian real could mean that the renminbi is denied IVC status – and that Shanghai fails to achieve 1-IFC status – for generations, if not forever.",
            "人民币崛起？ 上海—在中国，一场日益激烈的争论是人民币是否应该国际化，加入美元和欧元的行列成为国际媒介货币（international vehicle currency，IVC ） ， 即其他国家用来为贸易商品和国际贷款计价的货币。 与此有关的一场争论是上海是否能够成为顶级国际金融中心（first-tier international financial center ，1-IFC ） ， 与伦敦和纽约相抗衡。 金融史可以帮助回答这些问题。 首先，一个城市只有在所在国货币成为IVC时才可能成为1-IFC。 但是，正如伦敦的地位所表明的，即使所在国货币已不再是IVC，老牌1-IFC仍可以保有其在国际金融体系中的地位。 其次，使用外国货币作为交易媒介的交易成本与这种货币的全球使用程度成反比。 外国投资者使用某一特定国际金融中心具有类似的规模经济特征。 因此，IVC和1-IFC的数量不会超过三四个。 第三，一国的金融部门必须是开放的，没有资本管制，并且十分成熟，具备各种工具和机构。 它还必须是安全的，有一家维持经济稳定的中央银行，有监督欺诈和投机的审慎监管者，有足够的金融救火能力的宏观审慎当局，有可预测、透明、公正的司法体系。 IVC和1-IFC的第四个（也是最重要的一个）成功秘诀是，在相当长的一段时间里，其国民经济相对其他经济体保持优势。 英国占据全球经济领导地位超过一百年。 1914年，美国/英国GDP之比为2.1，但美元仍不是IVC，这表明美国的相对经济实力仍不够强大。 十年后的1924年，美国/英国GDP之比变为3.2，并呈现继续上升之势，美元也超过英镑成为最重要的IVC。 相对经济强势解释了为何日元没有发展成为IVC，以及东京 — — 其金融市场已满足相关条件 — — 没有能够成为1-IFC。 在1991年的最高峰，日本GDP只有美国的60 % ， 因此日本从未达到过促使外国人使用日元来降低交易成本的临界值。 确定人民币和上海的未来国际地位必须从计算两种大概率情形下中国对美国的相对经济强度开始。 在第一种情形中，中国将陷入中等收入陷阱，人均GDP停留在美国的30 % — —拉美最大的五个经济体自1960年以来便处于这一状态，马来西亚则从1994年开始处于这一状态。 这意味着中国对美国的相对经济强度为1.1，远远低于必要条件比率。 在第二种较有利的情形中，中国人均GDP将达到美国的80 % — —高于西欧最大的五个经济体自1960年以来的平均水平70 % — —其对美国的相对经济强度将达到2.8左右。 这意味着人民币有资格获得IVC地位，上海也有资格选择是否成为1-IFC。 但中国经济相对美国的强度不足以保证通过自然市场力量让人民币获得国际成功。 基于此，中国政府必须采取果断措施鼓励国际交易者和债权人用人民币为交易定价。 具体而言，中国必须利用其市场实力促使用人民币为相关出口制造品和原材料进口品定价，并鼓励用人民币为中国购买的外国金融资产计价（在这方面，中国的净债权人地位应能有所助益 ） 。 但在此过程中需要规避诸多陷阱。 正如1997—1998年亚洲金融危机所标明的，资本账户自由化可能导致金融崩溃 — — 这也是人民币国际化的反对者经常提到的危险。 但这些风险尚不足以胜过金融开放的潜在好处，也可以通过有效监控和监管实现最小化，包括提高资本缓冲、降低杠杆率以及成立清算信托公司等强大的危机反应机制。 事实上，有效的金融监控和审慎管理体系并不一定要先于资本账户开放。 相反，发展和实施金融监管必须是渐进过程，根据现有知识和第一手经验改进。 毕竟，不存在永远完全开放或封闭的金融市场，给定时刻的开放程度根据政策选择而定。 最近成立的上海自由贸易区将允许离岸国际金融中心的出现，中国监管者将受到真实世界的训练。 这将让他们获得识别危机发展信号、扼杀风险、有效处理倒闭金融机构资本重组所需要的工具。 中国对IVC和1-IFC的追求不仅符合其自身利益。 让人民币帮助满足世界对国际储备和风险多元化的需求能加强全球金融稳定。 人民币国际化刻不容缓。 能成为IVC的货币数量极为有限，如果人民币不能抢在印度卢比、俄罗斯卢布或巴西雷亚尔之前成为IVC将意味着在几代人的时间里（如果不是永远的话）人民币都将失去IVC地位，上海也将无法获得1-IFC地位。"

            "Winners and Losers in Putin’s War NEW YORK – It is one month into Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war against Ukraine. Actually, there are two wars: A Russian war waged mainly against Ukraine’s cities and civilian population, and a war fought by Ukraine’s armed forces against Russian troops. Russia is winning the former; Ukraine is winning the latter. Ideally, negotiations will lead to a ceasefire and a lasting settlement. But it is equally if not more likely that the conflict will continue for some time, especially if Putin decides to embrace a strategy that reduces the exposure of his troops to combat and rejects a negotiated outcome on terms the government of Ukraine could accept. “Limited war, no peace,” to paraphrase Trotsky, would be the result. Who would be the winners and losers in such a scenario? It is easiest to point to the biggest loser: Russia. It is clear now that Putin will be unable to achieve the political objectives he likely sought, namely, to march into Kyiv and replace Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s government with one friendly to the Kremlin. Putin’s war of choice may have destroyed much of Ukraine physically, but the unprecedented sanctions and economic isolation his decision has wrought are destroying Russia economically. In addition, many talented Russians have voted with their feet and left the country. Moreover, Russia’s army has been decimated (losing as many as 15,000 soldiers in a month) and exposed as something of a Potemkin force, one that will take years to rebuild. The calculation is more complex when it comes to Ukraine. The resilience of its leadership, society, and armed forces are a marvel. National identity is more robust than ever; Ukraine’s staunch resistance has strengthened its young democracy. But that strengthening has come at a great cost. An estimated ten million Ukrainians – a quarter of the population – are internally displaced or refugees. The economy has been wrecked. Rebuilding will take a lot of time and a lot of money. NATO, although untested militarily, is a big winner so far. It is more united and stronger as a result of Russia’s aggression. It also benefits from the poor performance of the Russian armed forces, which appear to be no match for the Western alliance, and from an American president who believes in it. Germany and its new government and chancellor are another big winner. Implicit in the response of Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s government is the understanding that the legacy of Scholz’s predecessor, Angela Merkel, is now decidedly more mixed, because she allowed Germany to become so dependent on Russian energy. Scholz’s decision to cancel the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, commitment to double defense spending, and willingness to funnel arms to Ukraine represent dramatic, significant changes. The only disappointment is that it will take years for the German economy to wean itself from Russian gas, a reality that provides critical ballast to Russia’s economy. US President Joe Biden has also gained. He has for the most part skillfully managed a policy of supporting Ukraine, penalizing Russia, and, by rejecting calls for putting “boots on the ground” or establishing a no-fly zone, done so without risking World War III. Biden has also brought America’s allies together, something sorely needed after four years of Donald Trump and a mishandled US withdrawal from Afghanistan. His one major slip has been to corner Putin further by calling him a war criminal and hinting at regime change when the goal of US policy ought to be to get Putin to stop the war and avoid escalation of any sort. China and its president, Xi Jinping, are in a worse position strategically than they were just one month ago. By associating so closely with Putin, Xi has exposed himself to criticism for a flawed judgment that damages China’s reputation and raises the risks that it will be targeted with secondary sanctions. While China has long sought to divide the West, its alignment with Russia has done the opposite, alienating Western Europe, where it had been making significant economic inroads. It will also lead to a much tougher US policy toward China and highlight the costs China could face if it were ever to move militarily against Taiwan. Otherwise, there are many more losers than winners, as befits a war. The United Nations and especially the Security Council appear feckless. The war is bad for global efforts to slow the spread of nuclear weapons. Ukraine gave up its stockpile 28 years ago in exchange for an assurance of its territorial integrity, only to be invaded twice since 2014. The crisis has likewise been bad for efforts to combat climate change, which at least temporarily appears to have taken a back seat to measures designed to promote energy security. It is also a bad crisis for those who have been arguing that territorial conquest and wars between countries were a thing of the past or those who have argued in recent years that things have never been better. Events have also worked against the arguments of those on the left and right alike that the biggest danger to international security is American overreach and that the United States can safely turn inwards. Last but far from least, there is the matter of what this conflict will mean for world order. Russia’s invasion violated the most basic tenet of what stability exists in the world: that borders are not to be changed by the threat or use of force. Much will hinge on whether Putin gets away with his gamble, or whether the price he is forced to pay exceeds any gains. That, more than anything else, will determine history’s ultimate verdict regarding what was won and what was lost in Putin’s war.",
            "普京的战争的赢家和输家 纽约—俄罗斯总统普京的乌克兰战争已经过去了一个月。 实际上，有两场战争：一场主要针对乌克兰城市和平民的俄罗斯战争，以及一场由乌克兰武装部队与俄罗斯军队之间战争。 俄罗斯正在赢得前者；乌克兰正在赢得后者。 理想情况下，谈判会带来停火和持久解决。 但同样，如果可能性有过之而无不及的是冲突将持续一段时间，特别是如果普京决定采取减少他的部队在暴露于战斗中，并拒绝以乌克兰政府可以接受的条款谈判结果的战略的话。 用托洛茨基的话来说 ， “ 有限的战争，就没有和平 ” ， 这就是俄乌战争的结果。 在这种情况下，谁会是赢家和输家？ 最显然的是最大的输家：俄罗斯。 现在很明显，普京将无法实现他可能寻求的政治目标，即进军基辅并用一个亲克里姆林宫的政府取代乌克兰总统泽连斯基的政府。 普京选择的战争可能在物理上摧毁了乌克兰的大部分地区，但他的决定造成的前所未有的制裁和经济孤立正在经济上摧毁俄罗斯。 此外，许多才华横溢的俄罗斯人已经用脚投票离开了这个国家。 此外，俄罗斯的军队已经被歼灭（一个月内损失多达15,000名士兵 ） ， 很有可能变成波将金军队（Potemkin force ） ， 需要数年时间才能重建。 对于乌克兰，算盘更为复杂。 其领导层、社会和武装部队的韧性令人惊叹。 民族认同比以往任何时候都更加强大；乌克兰的顽强抵抗加强了其年轻的民主。 但这种强化付出了巨大的代价。 估计有一千万乌克兰人（占人口的四分之一）是成为国内流民和难民。 经济遭到破坏。 重建将花费大量时间和大量资金。 北约虽然未经军事考验，但迄今为止是一个大赢家。 由于俄罗斯的侵略，它变得更加团结和强大。 它还得益于俄罗斯武装部队的拙劣表现 — — 看起来它似乎无法与西方联盟相匹敌，以及一位坚信北约的美国总​​统。 德国及其新政府和总理是另一个大赢家。 总理朔尔茨政府的应对方针所隐含的理解是，朔尔茨前任默克尔的遗产现在变得更加复杂，因为她让德国极度依赖俄罗斯能源。 朔尔茨决定取消北溪 2 号天然气管道，承诺将国防开支翻一番，并愿意向乌克兰输送武器，这是一个戏剧性的重大变化。 唯一令人失望的是，德国经济需要数年时间才能摆脱对俄罗斯天然气的依赖，而这一现实为俄罗斯经济提供了重要的底气。 美国总统拜登也有所收获。 他略施巧计，支持乌克兰、惩罚俄罗斯的政策，同时拒绝 “踏上乌克兰土地”或建立禁飞区的呼吁，从而消灭了爆发第三次世界大战的风险。 拜登还将美国的盟友聚集在一起，这是在特朗普执政四年后，以及美国从阿富汗混乱撤军后迫切需要的。 他的一个重大失误是进一步逼迫普京，称他为战犯，在美国应该将让普京停止战争并避免任何形式的升级作为政策目标时暗示要颠覆政权。 中国及其国家主席习近平在战略上的处境比一个月前变糟了。 习近平与普京走得太近，因为其有缺陷的判断损害了中国的声誉、增加了中国遭到二级制裁的风险而受到批评。 中国长期以来一直试图分裂西方，但它与俄罗斯的结盟却适得其反，疏远了它已取得重大经济利益的西欧。 这也将导致美国对中国采取更加强硬的政策，突出中国对台湾采取军事行动可能面临的代价。 除此之外，输家比赢家多得多，战争就是这样。 联合国，尤其是安理会显得无能。 战争不利于全球减缓核武器扩散的努力。 乌克兰在 28 年前放弃了核武器换取对其领土完整的保证，但自 2014 年以来只被入侵两次。 这场危机同样不利于应对气候变化的努力，它们的重要性至少暂时已不如保证能源安全的措施。 对于那些一直认为领土征服和国家间战争已成为过去的人，或那些近年来认为情况前所未有地好的人来说，这也是一场糟糕的危机。 情况也不利于左翼和右翼人士的论点，即国际安全的最大危险是美国的过度扩张，美国可以安全地向内转。 最后，这场冲突对世界秩序意味着什么也是个问题。 俄罗斯的入侵违反了世界上最基本的稳定原则：边界不能因为威胁或使用武力而改变。 很多事情将取决于普京会不会侥幸成功，或者他被迫付出的代价是否超过了任何收益。 这是最重要的，决定了历史对普京战争中的胜利和失败的最终裁决。"

            "Winners and Losers in the Post-9/11 Era September 11, 2001, is one of those dates that mark a transformation in world politics. Just as the fall of the Berlin Wall on November 9, 1989, signified the Cold War’s end, al-Qaeda’s attack on the United States opened a new epoch. A non-governmental group killed more Americans that day than the government of Japan did with its surprise attack on another transformative date, December 7, 1941. While the jihadi terrorist movement had been growing for a decade, 9/11 was the turning point. Five years into this new era, how should we characterize it? Some believe that 9/11 ushered in a “clash of civilizations” between Islam vs. the West. Indeed, that is probably what Osama bin Laden had in mind. Terrorism is a form of theater. Extremists kill innocent people in order to dramatize their message in a way that shocks and horrifies their intended audience. They also rely on what Clark McCauley and others have called “jujitsu politics,” in which a smaller fighter uses the strength of the larger opponent to defeat him. In that sense, bin Laden hoped that the US would be lured into a bloody war in Afghanistan, similar to the Soviet intervention two decades earlier, which had created such a fertile recruiting ground for jihadists. But the Americans used a modest amount of force to remove the Taliban government, avoided disproportionate civilian casualties, and were able to create an indigenous political framework. While far from perfect, the first round in the fight went to the US. Al-Qaeda lost the sanctuaries from which it planned its attacks; many of its leaders were killed or captured; and its central communications were severely disrupted. Then the Bush administration succumbed to hubris and made the colossal mistake of invading Iraq without broad international support. Iraq provided the symbols, civilian casualties, and recruiting ground that the jihadi extremists had sought in Afghanistan. Iraq was George Bush’s gift to Osama bin Laden. Al-Qaeda lost its central organizational capacity, but it became a symbol and focal point around which like-minded imitators could rally. With the help of the Internet, its symbols and training materials became easily available around the world. Whether al-Qaeda had a direct role in the Madrid and London bombings, or the recent plot to blow up airliners over the Atlantic, is less important than the way it has been transformed into a powerful “brand.” The second round went to the extremists. The outcome of future rounds in the struggle against jihadi terrorism will depend on our ability to avoid the trap of “jujitsu politics.” That will require more use of the soft power of attraction rather than relying so heavily on hard military power, as the Bush administration has done. For the struggle is not a clash of Islam vs. the West, but a civil war within Islam between a minority of terrorists and a larger mainstream of non-violent believers. Jihadi extremism cannot be defeated unless the mainstream wins. Military force, intelligence, and international police cooperation needs to be used against hardcore terrorists affiliated with or inspired by al-Qaeda, but soft power is essential to attracting the mainstream and drying up support for the extremists. US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld once said that the measure of success in this war is whether the number of terrorists we are killing and deterring is larger than the number that the terrorists are recruiting. By this standard, we are doing badly. In November 2003, the official number of terrorist insurgents in Iraq was given as 5,000. This year, it was reported to be 20,000. As Brig. General Robert Caslen, the Pentagon’s deputy director for the war on terrorism, put it, “We are not killing them faster than they are being created.” We are also failing in the application of soft power. According to Caslen, “We in the Pentagon are behind our adversaries in the use of communication – either to recruit or train.” The manner in which we use military power also affects Rumsfeld’s ratio. In the aftermath of 9/11, there was a good deal of sympathy and understanding around the world for America’s military response against the Taliban. The US invasion of Iraq, a country that was not connected to the 9/11 attacks, squandered that good will, and the attractiveness of the US in Muslim countries like Indonesia plummeted from 75% approval in 2000 to half that level today. Indeed, occupying a divided nation is messy, and it is bound to produce episodes like Abu Ghraib and Haditha, which undercut America’s attractiveness not just in Iraq, but around the world. The ability to combine hard and soft power is smart power. When the Soviet Union invaded Hungary and Czechoslovakia during the Cold War, it undercut the soft power that it had enjoyed in Europe in the aftermath of World War II. When Israel launched a lengthy bombing campaign in Lebanon last month, it created so many civilian casualties that the early criticisms of Hezbollah by Egypt, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia became untenable in Arab politics. When terrorist excesses killed innocent Muslim civilians such as Egyptian Islamic Jihad did in 1993 or Abu Musab al-Zarqawi did in Amman in 2005, they undercut their own soft power and lost support. The most important lesson five years after 9/11 is that failure to combine hard and soft power effectively in the struggle against jihadi terrorism will lead us into the trap set by those who want a clash of civilizations. Muslims, including Islamists, have a diversity of views, so we need to be wary of strategies that help our enemies by uniting disparate forces behind one banner. We have a just cause and many potential allies, but our failure to combine hard and soft power into a smart strategy could be fatal.",
            "后9/11时代的赢家和输家 2001年9月11日是标志世界政治转折的日子之一。 正如1989年11月9日柏林墙倒塌标志着冷战的结束，基地组织对美国的袭击开创了一个新的时代。 一个非政府组织在那天杀死的美国人比日本政府在另一个具有转折意义的日子，1941年12月7日，发动突然袭击杀害的人数还要多。 尽管杰哈德恐怖运动10年来一直快速发展，9/11仍然是一个重要转折。 在如今离新时代开启已满5年之际，我们又该如何定义这个时代呢？ 有人认为9/11导致了伊斯兰和西方之间“文明的碰撞 ” 。 没错，那也许正是奥萨马·本·拉登袭击美国的初衷。 恐怖主义是一种戏剧化的模式。 恐怖分子杀害无辜群众，以此来增强其信息的戏剧化效果，惊吓和恐吓他们的目标受众。 他们还必须依赖克拉克·麦考利和其他人所说的“柔道政治 ” ， 其核心是小个子斗士利用大个子对手的力量来击败他。 在这种意义上，本·拉登期望美国会禁不住引诱，像20年前苏联一样，在阿富汗发动一场血腥的战争。 苏联那次入侵为圣战分子创造了甚为肥沃的人员招募土壤。 但美国只派小股部队推翻了塔利班政府，避免了大规模的平民伤亡，还建立起了本土的政治框架。 尽管远远称不上完美，但美国赢得了战争的第一个回合。 基地组织失去了策划袭击活动的庇护所，很多高层领导人物命丧黄泉或锒铛入狱，其核心领导层的消息传递也严重受阻。 接着布什政府被傲慢自大冲昏了头脑，没有赢得国际社会的普遍支持就贸然入侵伊拉克。 杰哈德极端分子在阿富汗未能得到的象征标志、平民伤亡和人员招募土壤，都在伊拉克战争中如愿以偿。 伊拉克是布什送给奥萨马·本·拉登的一份厚礼。 基地组织失去了核心组织能力，却成了号召思想极端的模仿者们的旗帜和焦点。 通过互联网络，基地组织的标志和训练材料可以在全球范围内轻易得到。 无论基地组织是否直接参与了马德里和伦敦爆炸案，或者前不久在大西洋上空炸毁航班的阴谋，与它已经转型为恐怖主义最大“品牌”的事实相比都显得无关紧要。 极端分子赢得了第二回合。 反抗杰哈德恐怖主义今后斗争的结果将取决于我们能否避开“柔道政治”的重重陷阱。 这需要更多利用吸引力等软性力量，而不能像布什政府那样过多地依赖强硬的军事实力。 因为这场斗争的双方不是伊斯兰和西方世界，而是伊斯兰内部矛盾，对立双方是少数恐怖分子，以及作为主流的伊斯兰非暴力信徒。 只有主流获胜，才能击败杰哈德极端主义。 这需要军队、情报和国际警察部门通力合作，打击基地组织下属、或在其感召下成立的强硬恐怖分子。 然而，在吸引伊斯兰主流民众、铲除对极端分子的支持方面，软性力量起着至关重要的作用。 美国国防部长拉姆斯菲尔德曾经说过：这场战争胜负的衡量标准是看我们杀死和遏制的恐怖分子是否超过了他们所吸收的新鲜血液。 按照这样的标准，我们的成绩不容乐观。 2001年，伊拉克叛乱分子的官方统计数字是5，000。 今年，据称这个数字已经增加到20，000。 正如五角大楼副主任罗伯特·凯斯伦准将所说的那样 ， “ 我们消灭他们的速度远远比不上他们自我复制的速度 。 ” 在软性力量的应用方面，我们也做得非常不够。 凯斯伦说 ， “ 五角大楼在宣传沟通的运用上不及我们的对手¾在人员招募和训练方面都是如此 。 ” 我们使用军事力量的方式也影响到“拉姆斯菲尔德比 ” 。 9/11事件后，全世界都对美国对塔利班的军事打击表示理解和同情，而美国入侵与9/11袭击毫无瓜葛的伊拉克将世界人民的同情挥霍殆尽。 美国在印度尼西亚等穆斯林国家的吸引力指数已经从2000年的74%大幅下降至上述比例的一半。 实际上，占领一个四分五裂的国家本身就非常棘手，像阿布格莱布和哈迪塞这样的事件几乎肯定会发生，它们使美国在伊拉克、乃至全球的吸引力都大受影响。 硬性和软性力量的结合需要智慧。 苏联在冷战期间对匈牙利和捷克斯洛伐克的侵略破坏了二战结束时它在欧洲国家中曾经有过的软性力量。 以色列上月在黎巴嫩的长时间轰炸造成了太多的平民伤亡，使得埃及、约旦和沙特阿拉伯从前对真主党的批判在阿拉伯政治中丧失了根基。 如果毫无节制的恐怖分子再像伊斯兰杰哈德1993年在埃及或者扎卡维2005年在安曼那样去杀害无辜的穆斯林民众，损害的将是他们自己的软性力量，失去的是民众对他们的支持。 9/11事件发生五年后最重大的教训是：如果不能在应对杰哈德恐怖主义的斗争中将硬性和软性力量有效地结合在一起，我们就会落入文化冲突论者早已设置好的陷阱。 穆斯林，包括伊斯兰教徒在内，有着多种不同的观点，因此我们必须对能够帮助我们的敌人联合各种力量的策略保持警惕。 我们拥有正义的事业和很多潜在的盟友，但如果不能将硬性和软性力量结合成明智的策略，将可能给我们带来致命的打击。"

            "The Middle East’s Lost Decade BERLIN – The United States has waged three wars since Al Qaeda’s terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001: against Al Qaeda, in Afghanistan, and in Iraq. The first two were forced upon the US, but the third was the result of a willful, deliberate decision by former President George W. Bush, taken on ideological grounds and, most likely, for personal reasons as well. Had Bush, former Vice President Dick Cheney, former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, and their neocon allies been forthright about their intentions – to bring down Saddam Hussein by means of war, thereby creating a new, pro-Western Middle East – they never would have received the support of Congress and the American public. Their vision was both naive and reckless. So a threat – Iraqi weapons of mass destruction – had to be created. As we now know, the threat was based on lies (aluminum tubes for a nuclear-weapons program, for example, meetings between the 9/11 plot leader, Mohamed Atta, and Iraqi officials in Prague, and even glaring forgeries like supposed Iraqi orders for yellowcake uranium from Niger). Such were the justifications for a war that was to claim the lives of almost 5,000 US soldiers and more than 100,000 Iraqis. Add to that the millions more who were injured and displaced from their homes, as well as the destruction of one of the world’s oldest Christian communities. For this, the US alone spent up to $3 trillion. Bush’s war against Saddam did radically change the Middle East, though not as he envisaged. For starters, if the US had set out to destabilize Iraq, its efforts could hardly have been more successful: ten years later, the country’s viability as a single state has never been in greater doubt. With Saddam gone, Iraq’s Shia majority assumed power after a horrendous civil war, leaving Iraq’s defeated Sunnis longing for revenge and waiting for an opportunity to regain their ascendancy. The Kurds in the north cleverly and adeptly used the window of opportunity that opened before them to seize de facto independence, though the key question of control over the northern city of Kirkuk remains a ticking time bomb. And all are fighting for as large a share of Iraq’s enormous oil and gas reserves as they can get. Taking stock of “Operation Iraqi Freedom” a decade later, the Financial Times concluded that the US won the war, Iran won the peace, and Turkey won the contracts. I can only agree. In political terms, Iran is the big winner of Bush’s war. Its number-one enemy, Saddam, was dispatched by its number-two enemy, the United States, which presented Iran with a golden opportunity to extend its influence beyond its western border for the first time since 1746. Bush’s war, with its poor strategic vision and worse planning, increased Iran’s regional standing in a way that the country was unlikely ever to have achieved on its own. The war enabled Iran to assert itself as the dominant power in the Gulf and the wider region, and its nuclear program serves precisely these ambitions. The losers in the region are also clear: Saudi Arabia and the other Gulf states, which feel existentially threatened, and have come to regard their own Shia minorities as an Iranian fifth column. They have a point: with the Shia in power in Iraq, Iran will seek suitable opportunities to use local Shia populations as proxies to assert its hegemonic claims. This is what is fueling Bahrain’s domestic turmoil, beyond the Shia majority’s local grievances. Leaving aside the lies, fictions, and questions of morality and personal responsibility, the critical mistake of America’s war against Iraq was the absence of either a viable plan or the necessary strength to enforce a Pax Americana in the Middle East. America was powerful enough to destabilize the existing regional order, but not powerful enough to establish a new one. The US neocons, with their wishful thinking, grossly underestimated the scale of the task at hand – unlike the revolutionaries in Iran, who quickly moved in to reap what the US had sowed. The Iraq war also marked the beginning of America’s subsequent relative decline. Bush squandered a large part of America’s military strength in Mesopotamia for an ideological fiction – strength that is sorely missed in the region ten years later. And there is no alternative to be seen without America. While there is no causal link between the Iraq war and the Arab revolutions that began in December 2010, their implications have combined in a malign manner. Since the war, the bitter enmities between Al Qaeda and other Salafist and Sunni Arab nationalist groups have given way to cooperation or even mergers. This, too, is a result brought about by the American neocon masterminds. And the regional destabilization triggered by the Arab revolutions is increasingly converging on Iraq, mainly via Syria and Iran. Indeed, the gravest current danger to the region is a process of national disintegration emanating from the Syrian civil war, which is threatening to spread not only to Iraq, but also to Lebanon and Jordan. What makes Syria’s civil war so dangerous is that the players on the ground are no longer its driving forces. Rather, the war has become a struggle for regional dominance between Iran on one side and Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Turkey on the other. As a result, the Middle East is at risk of becoming the Balkans of the twenty-first century – a decline into regional chaos that began with, and was largely the result of, the US-led invasion ten years ago.",
            "中东失去的十年 柏林 — — 2001年9月11日的“基地”组织恐怖袭击后美国已发动对“基地”组织、阿富汗和伊拉克的三次战争。 前两次美国是因为迫不得已，但第三次则是前总统乔治·W·布什出于意识形态、极可能还有个人理由做出的故意决定。 假使布什、前副总统迪克·切尼、国防部长唐纳德·拉姆斯菲尔德及其新保守派盟友将借助战争手段推翻萨达姆·侯赛因并建设亲西方新中东的真正意图公之于众，他们永远也得不到美国国会和公众的支持。 他们的理想鲁莽而且非常幼稚。 因此必须捏造出来自伊拉克的大规模杀伤性武器威胁。 我们现在知道这种威胁纯属谎言（核武器计划的铝管、9/11阴谋领导者穆罕默德·阿塔跟伊拉克官员在布拉格会面、甚至令人发指地伪造出所谓伊拉克从尼日尔订购铀“黄饼”的订单 ） 。 这就是发动夺去近5,000名美军士兵和100,000多伊拉克人生命的战争的理由。 这场战争还造成数百万人受伤和流离失所，并对世界最古老的基督教群体造成了毁灭性的破坏。 仅美国在伊战中的花费就高达3万亿美元。 布什对萨达姆的战争的确从根本上改变了中东局势，尽管这种改变完全出乎他自己的预料。 首先，如果美国的初衷是破坏伊拉克稳定，那恐怕这一目标已经完美实现：10年后，伊拉克能否作为统一国家存在都充满了变数。 萨达姆被推翻后，伊拉克的什叶多数派在恐怖内战后上台，而被打败的逊尼派则渴望报复、等待夺回优势的机会。 北方的库尔德人巧妙地利用这次机会实现了事实上的独立，尽管北部城市基尔库克关键的控制问题依然是一枚定时炸弹。 所有人都竭尽全力争夺伊拉克庞大的石油和天然气资源。 英国《金融时报》十年后盘点“伊拉克自由行动 ” ， 认为美国赢得了战争、伊朗赢得了和平而土耳其赢得了合同。 我只能表示同意。 伊朗是布什战争在政治意义上最大的赢家。 其头号敌人萨达姆被二号敌人美国推翻，伊朗也由此看到了1746年以来首次将影响力扩大到西部边境以外的黄金机会。 布什的战争因其蹩脚的战略眼光和糟糕的计划从某种意义上提升了伊朗的区域地位，这种提升伊朗靠自己的力量永远不可能做到。 战争使伊朗成为海湾及更大范围内的主导力量，而核计划恰恰满足了伊朗在这方面的野心。 中东地区的输家也非常明确：感觉生存受到威胁、开始将国内什叶派���数族裔视为伊朗第五纵队的沙特阿拉伯和其他海湾国家。 他们其实有一定道理：由于什叶派在伊拉克掌权，伊朗会寻找适当时机利用当地什叶派人口代理维护其霸权要求。 这是除什叶多数派对当地的不满之外激起巴林国内动乱的理由。 除去谎言、虚构、道德问题和个人责任等因素，美国对伊战争最致命的失误是缺乏可行计划及必要势力在中东贯彻美国治下的和平。 美国的强大足以摧毁原有的地区秩序，但却不足以建立新的秩序。 一厢情愿的美国新保守主义者严重低估了这项任务的难度 — — 而伊朗革命党人却恰恰相反，他们迅速行动夺走了美国种下的果实。 伊拉克战争也成为美国相对衰落开始的标志。 布什在美索不达米亚的意识形态谎言中浪费了美国很大一部分军力 — — 十年后这些军力在该地区还根本无法补充。 美国的力量仍然无法代替。 尽管伊拉克战争和2010年12月开始的阿拉伯革命间不存在因果关系，但两者的影响已经以恶性的方式互相结合。 战后“基地”组织和其他萨拉菲斯特和逊尼派阿拉伯民族主义团体间苦涩的仇恨已经被合作、甚至兼并所取代。 这同样是美国新保守主义操纵者所带来的苦果。 由阿拉伯革命引发的地区动荡通过叙利亚和伊朗越来越集中到伊拉克。 事实上，地区目前最严重的威胁是叙利亚内战导致的国家解体，它不仅有可能威胁到伊拉克，也有可能威胁到黎巴嫩和约旦。 令叙利亚内战如此危险的是其实际参与者已不再是战争的驱动力量。 相反，这场战争已经演变为伊朗和沙特阿拉伯、卡塔尔和土耳其之间对地区霸权的争夺。 中东也因此有可能沦为二十一世纪的巴尔干 — — 陷入到十年前以美国为首侵略所造成的区域动荡之中。"

            "Winning the Confidence Game NEW HAVEN – On April 2, the G-20 will hold a summit in London to discuss what we may hope will be an internationally coordinated plan to address the world economic crisis. But can such a plan really work? The basic problem, of course, is confidence. People everywhere, consumers and investors alike, are canceling spending plans, because the world economy seems very risky right now. The same thing happened during the Great Depression of the 1930’s. A contemporary observer, Winthrop Case, explained it all in 1938: economic revival depended “on the willingness of individual and corporate buyers to make purchases that necessarily tie up their resources for a considerable length of time. For the individual, this implies confidence in the job, and in the end comes equally back to the confidence of industry leaders.” Unfortunately, confidence did not return until World War II ended the depression. If the leaders meeting in London are to succeed where governments failed in the 1930’s, they must commit themselves to a fiscal target that is sufficient to restore full employment under normal credit conditions. They must also commit themselves to a credit target that will restore lending to normal. People will not spend normally unless they have both a job and normal access to credit. During the Great Depression, such targets were not used on a large enough scale, merely fueling public despair that stimulus policies would ever work. The G-20 Summit should also be an occasion for affirming some basic principles. Confidence isn’t built up on the basis of spending or lending alone. People need to believe that the money represents something more lasting than stimulus measures, which may eventually end in failure. After all, the Great Depression did not end simply because of the massive stimulus of war-related expenditures. Why should World War II have produced any confidence in the future? To be sure, World War II reduced the unemployment rate in the United States dramatically, from 15% in 1940 to 1% in 1944, and had a similar effect in other countries. But this was not because of a revival in business confidence. It was because of a nasty war, plain and simple, with people drafted into fighting, or into industries supplying the war effort. The real recovery of confidence did not occur until after World War II, when the world did not sink back into depression. The US Council of Economic Advisors warned of this possibility in 1949, and it was not alone. There appears to be more than one reason why, on the contrary, confidence came roaring back. First, there was a general perception of “pent-up demand.” After years of privation (and in many countries the physical destruction of war), people just wanted to live normally – to rebuild, own a home, a car, and other consumer goods. The widespread impression that there was such pent-up demand also led people to believe that there could not be another depression. The perception of pent-up demand was like a powerful economic stimulus package, and it had the advantage that people believed it would be long-lasting. Indeed, the same long-term confidence triggered the post-war “baby boom.” According to some contemporary observers, however, “pent-up demand” was only part of the story. During the brief but deep recession of 1949, the financial commentator Silvia Porter reflected on the attitudes that led to the 1929 crash: “We saw nothing wrong – in fact, we saw everything right – with the wild speculative boom and credit inflation that…culminated in the now almost unbelievable gambling orgy of 1929.” But now, Porter wrote, after the depression and war, “We began to listen to the idea that a hundred million citizens, acting through a central government, could achieve much more than a hundred million acting as separate selfish units. We developed, in short, a new attitude toward the responsibilities of government.” She concluded that the positive effect of “pent-up demand” and government measures can “make sense only when viewed against the background of our changed economic and political philosophy.” The Marshall Plan, which operated from 1947 to 1951, became a symbol of this new attitude. The US gave billions of dollars of aid to rebuild war-ravaged countries in Europe. The plan was widely viewed as reflecting a new kind of enlightenment, a recognition of the importance of supporting people who needed help. Europe would not be allowed to languish, and the stimulus came from abroad. After the war, Keynesian economic theory, which was generally not accepted or understood during the Great Depression, became the basis of a new social compact. It was a theory that was perfectly suited to a generation that had just endured exceptional sacrifices, for it reaffirmed a belief in our responsibility for each other. The effect of economic stimulus is redoubled by this kind of inspirational belief. That is why all of the commitments made and intentions expressed at the upcoming G-20 summit matter. The countries represented must show a generous spirit and make the world economy work for all people. Seemingly peripheral issues, like aid to the developing world and the poor, who suffer the most from a crisis like this one, will be part of the primary story of the renewal of confidence, just as the Marshall Plan was part of that story after World War II.",
            "信心是胜利的根本 纽海文 — — 4月2日，20国集团将在伦敦举行峰会，会议的主题是，为了应对目前面临的经济危机，如何建立一个国际间相互合作协调的方案。 这正是我们目前所关心的问题。 难道这方案真的会管用么？ 当然，问题的关键还是信心问题。 面临着波及全球范围的经济危机，世界各地的人们，不管是消费着还是投资者，都在削减开支，就象1930年代的大萧条那样。 当时的亲历者温思罗普·凯斯在1938年这样写到：经济的复苏靠的是“企业和个人愿意投资和消费，而且需要持续相当长的一段时间。 对个人来说，就是要对自己的工作有信心，对企业来说，就是老板对所从事的行业有信心 。 ” 不幸的是，直到第二次世界大战结束，信心才开始恢复，萧条真正得以结束。 伦敦参会的领袖们必须有一个清晰的财政目标，那就是保证充分的就业和信贷市场的正常化；同时，保证借贷市场的正常化也很重要。 人们只有在有了工作，有了借贷信用的时候，才会正常的消费。 这样才不会重导大萧条时代的覆辙。 仅仅依靠财政刺激方案是不可能获得成功的。 20国峰会同样要重申一些基本的准则。 信心不是靠消费和借贷才能恢复的。 人们要了解金钱不仅仅是由政府经济刺激方案来提供，而是要有一个稳定的来源。 如果只依靠政府的经济救助方案，最终不能达到恢复经济的目的。 毕竟，大萧条时代的结束并不是仅仅因为战争导致的大量支出。 然后，为什么二战后大家会有信心呢？ 应该看到，二战显著地减少了失业率。 例如，美国失业率从1940年的15%下降到1944年的1 % 。 其他国家也有类似的现象。 失业率减少的原因很简单，当然不是由于商业信心恢复，而是那场该死的战争本身：大量的人员或是被直接卷入战争，或是为战争相关产业服务。 市场信心的真正恢复是发生在二战之后。 当时的世界并没有重新回到经济萧条之中。 而在1949年，美国国家经济委员曾认为世界经济会重新回到萧条之中。 这当然不是偶然的。 信心恢复的原因比较复杂。 首先是因为“被压抑的需求”的爆发。 由于战争而导致的多年物质极度匮乏，因此，人们想要过一种正常的生活，战后的废墟需也要重新建立 — — 重建自己的家园，拥有自己的车和其他生活用品。 基于由于以上的共同认识，人们普遍认为不会再会有另一次经济萧条。 如此强大的需求就如同经济刺激方案，特别是大家都认为这会是一种长久的需求。 同样的信心也导致了战后“婴儿潮”的出现。 对当时的一些观察者来看 ， “ 被压抑的需求”只是经济复苏的原因之一。 1949年出现了短暂的经济萧条，在回顾1929年大萧条��期人们的表现时，当时的金融评论家塞尔威·波特说道 ： “ 那时候投机盛行，信贷膨胀，我们当时觉得一切都很正常，大家都沉浸在一时的狂欢盛宴之中，没有人意识到危险的到来 。 ” 但现在，波特写到 ： “ 现在，我们一亿公民的心声通过一个中央政府来集中体现，这比我们各自为政而产生的效果要好的多。 因此，我们需要对政府职责重新认识了 。 ” 只有在我们的 社会政治观念发生改变之后，她对“压抑的需求”和“政府职责”的积极方面才能体现出来。 1947—1945年的马歇尔计划正是这样改变的标志。 美国拿出数十亿美元重建战后的欧洲。 此举显示出一种全新的理念，那就是关注那些需要救助的人们。 为了防止欧洲的衰败，救助的力量必须来自欧洲大陆之外。 大萧条时代不能接受凯恩斯主义的经济理论，而在二战后以后，凯恩斯主义开始流行起来，经过二战之后，大家都已经付出了超出寻常的牺牲，为了战后的重建，大家仍然需要同舟共济，共同面对问题。 有了这种共识，再加上政府的经济刺激方案，所达到的效果就事半功倍了。 以上所阐述的就是20国领导峰会所要达到的目标。 参加的国家代表必须有着宽阔的胸襟，目的是为了整个人类的经济而努力。 就如同救助那些发展中国家和贫穷人口的那些方案那样，对于那些深陷经济危机的国家来说，重新建立信心是一个最重要的基础，这也就是“马歇尔计划”在二战后所发挥的作用。"

            "Winning the European Confidence Game CHICAGO – If any solution to the European crisis proposed over the next few days is to restore confidence to the sovereign-bond markets, it will have to be both economically viable and politically palatable to rescuers and rescued alike. This means paying attention not just to the plan’s technical details, but also to appearances. There is growing consensus about any solution’s key elements. First, Italy and Spain will have to come up with credible medium-term plans that will not just restore their fiscal health, but also improve their ability to grow their way out of trouble. While any plan will involve pain for citizens, the markets must deem the pain politically tolerable, at least relative to the alternatives. It is important that these plans be seen as domestically devised (though voters will have no illusions about the external and market pressures that have forced their governments to act). At the same time, an external agency such as the International Monetary Fund could render the plan more credible by evaluating it for consistency with the country’s goals and monitoring its implementation. Second, some vehicle – the IMF or the European Financial Stability Facility, with either entity funded directly by countries or the European Central Bank – has to stand ready to fund borrowing by Italy, Spain, and any other potentially distressed countries over the next year or two. But there is an important caveat, which has largely been ignored in public discussions: if this funding is senior to private debt (as IMF funding typically is), it will be harder for these countries to regain access to markets. After all, the more a country borrows in the short term from official sources, the further back in line it pushes private creditors. That makes private lenders susceptible to larger haircuts if the country eventually defaults – and thus more hesitant to lend in the first place. In other words, private markets need to be convinced both that there is a low probability of default (hence the importance of credible plans), and that there is some additional loss-bearing capacity in the new funding, so that, if there is a default, outstanding or rolled-over private debt does not have to bear the full brunt. This may seem unfair. Why should the taxpayer accept a loss when they are bailing out the private sector by providing new funding? In an ideal world, distressed countries would default as soon as private markets stopped funding them, and they would impose the losses on private bondholders. In the real world, however, if Italy and Spain are viewed as being solvent, or too big to fail, official funding should be structured so that it gives these countries their best chance to regain market confidence. This does not mean that official funding should be junior to private debt in any restructuring, for that would require substantially more loss-bearing capacity from the official sector – capacity that is probably not available. Indeed, if official funding were junior, it would be providing a larger cushion to private creditors – and thus bailing them out to an even greater extent. The simplest solution is to treat official funding no differently from private debt – best achieved if official lenders buy sovereign bonds as they are issued (possibly at a predetermined yield) and agree to be treated on par with private creditors in a restructuring. As the country regains market confidence, the official funding can be reduced, and eventually the bonds can be sold back to the markets. The bottom line is that official funding must be accompanied by loss-bearing capacity. If the funding is channeled through the IMF, and is to be treated on par with private debt, the Fund will need a guarantee from the EFSF or strong eurozone countries that it will be indemnified in any restructuring. Of course, the IMF’s member states might be willing to accept some burden sharing if a sufficient buffer provided by the eurozone were eroded, but that cannot be taken for granted. Once the first two elements of the plan are in place, there should be little need for the third – bond purchases by the ECB in the secondary market in order to narrow interest-rate spreads and provide further confidence. Indeed, if the ECB intends to claim preferred-creditor status for any bonds that it buys, it is probably best that it buy very few. Of course, the ECB will have to continue to provide support to banks until confidence about their holdings returns. But there is one more element that is needed to assure markets that the solution is politically viable. Citizens across Europe, whether in rescued countries or rescuing countries, will be paying for years to clean up a mess for which they were not responsible. Not all banks voluntarily loaded up on distressed government bonds – some were pressured by supervisors, others by governments – but many have made unwise bets. If they are seen as profiting unduly from the rescue, even as they return to their bad old ways of paying for non-performance, they will undermine political support for the rescue – and perhaps even for capitalism. So a final element of the package ought to be a monitored pledge by eurozone banks that they will not unload bonds as the official sector steps in; that they will raise capital over time instead of continuing to deleverage (if this hurts bank equity holders, they should think of this as burden sharing); and that they will be circumspect about banker bonuses until economies start growing strongly again. Cries that this is not capitalism should be met with a firm retort: “Nor are bailouts!”",
            "夺取欧洲信心战的胜利 芝加哥 — — 如果未来几天内出台的欧洲危机解决方案想要重塑人们对主权债券的信心的话，那么该计划就必须在经济上可行，而且在政治上可以让救援者和被救援者双方接受。 这意味着我们不仅要关注解决方案的技术细节，也要注意它的包装。 对于解决方案的关键点，人们越来越有了共识。 首先，意大利和西班牙必须给出可信的中期计划，不仅要重塑财政健康，还必须改善它们走出困境的能力。 不管是什么计划，公民肯定会经受一些痛苦，与此同时，市场必须认为这些痛苦在政治上是可接受的，至少要比替代方案好。 有一点很重要：这些计划应该被视为是由本国设计的（尽管选民们会对迫使本国政府采取行动的外部和市场压力心知肚明 ） 。 与此同时，外部机构，比如IMF，可以通过评估计划与该国目标的一致性以及监督计划的实施来加强计划的可信度。 其次，在未来一两年中，某些机构 — — IMF或欧洲金融稳定基金（由欧洲各国直接提供资金或由欧洲央行提供资金的实体 ） — —必须时刻准备着为意大利、西班牙和其他具有潜在风险的国家提供贷款融资。 但这里有一个在公众讨论中往往被忽视的重要警告：如果该融资比私人债务级别高（IMF融资通常如此 ） ， 那么这些国家重回资本市场将难上加难。 毕竟，一国从官方渠道借入的短期融资越多，私人债权的比重就越低。 这使得私人贷款人会怀疑如果该国最终违约，则其损失会更大，从而在一开始就对贷款犹豫不决。 换句话说，你必须让私人市场相信，你的违约概率很低（因此可信计划非常重要 ） ， 且新融资会有增加的损失吸收能力，万一违约发生，未偿还或展期的私人债务不会受到完全的损失。 这可能有些不公平。 为什么纳税人要在他们通过提供新融资拯救私人部门的同时接受损失？ 理想的情况是，受困国将在私人市场停止提供融资时立刻违约，损失将由私人债权人承担。 但是，在现实世界中如果意大利和西班牙被认定破了产（或太大而不能倒 ） ， 就必须组织官方融资，以便这些国家能尽可能地赢回市场信心。 这并不意味着官方融资应该在重组中获得比私人债务更低的地位，因为将要求官方部门拥有极大的损失吸收能力，而这有可能是不现实的。 事实上，如果官方融资地位较低，那么它相当于在为私人债权人提供更大的损失缓冲垫，从而更多地拯救私人债权人。 最简单的解决办法是对官方融资和私人债务一视同仁，最佳实现方式便是在发行主权债券时由官方贷款人购买（可以固定收益率 ） ， 官方贷款人同意在重组中与私人债权人具有同等地位。 当该国重新赢得市场信心时，官方融资可以削减，其买入的债券最终可以卖回给市场。 要点是官方融资必须具有损失吸收能力。 如果官方融资走IMF渠道并与私人债务一视同仁，那么IMF需要EFSF或欧元区坚挺国家的担保，它可以在重组中获得保护。 当然，如果欧元区所提供的充分缓冲遭到破坏的话，IMF成员国可能也会愿意接受一定责任共担，但不能把这一点视为理所当然。 当解决方案的前两大要素具备后，第三大要素 — — 欧洲央行在二级市场购买债券以缩小利差并提供更多的信心 — — 是否具备已经无关紧要了。 事实上，如果欧洲央行欲使其所买入的债券拥有优先债权地位，那么它最好不要大量买入。 当然，欧洲央行将不得不继续向银行提供支持，直到市场对它们所持有的债券恢复信心。 但要让市场相信解决办法在政治上可行，还需要另一大要素。 欧洲各国公民，不管是救援国还是被救援国，将在多年内为清理并非由他们引起的乱象买单。 并非所有的银行都是自愿买入受困国政府债券的 — — 一些是迫于监管者压力，一些是迫于政府要求 — — 但确实有很多银行做出了不明智的投资决策。 如果它们被认为从救援行动中不正当地得利了，那么就算它们回到为不良贷款买单的错误老路上去，也会破坏对救援行动 — — 乃至资本主义 — — 政治支持。 因此，解决方案的最后一大要素应该是欧元区银行作出受监控的承诺，它们不会在官方部门介入是卸去手上持有的债券；它们将不断筹集资���，而不是不断去杠杆化（如果银行股东因此受害，那么他们应该把这想象为责任共担机制 ） ； 它们必须谨慎发放奖金，直到经济再次开始强劲增长。 对于那些“这不是资本主义”的嚷嚷，我们可以大声地回应 ： “ 救援也不是 ！ ”"

            "Winning the Peace Afghanistan’s future hangs in the balance as its weak national government struggles to maintain support and legitimacy in the face of a widening insurgency, warlords, the heroin trade, and a disappointed populace. Across an arc extending from Afghanistan to East Africa, violence now also surges in Iraq, Lebanon, Somalia, and beyond, to Sudan’s Darfur region. Everywhere, politicians, generals, and even diplomats talk of military strategies and maneuvers, but everywhere something utterly different is needed. Stability will come only when economic opportunities exist, when a bulging generation of young men can find jobs and support families, rather than seeking their fortune in violence. We are seeing again and again that a foreign army, whether NATO’s in Afghanistan, America’s in Iraq, Israel’s in occupied Palestine, or Ethiopia’s in Somalia, may win a battle, or even a war, but never the peace. Peace is about dignity and hope for the future. Military occupation saps dignity, and grinding poverty and economic disarray sap hope. Peace can be achieved only with a withdrawal of foreign troops, and the arrival of jobs, productive farms and factories, tourism, health care, and schools. Without these, military victory and occupation quickly turn to ashes. The United States government has proven itself blind to these facts, but the international community also remains ill equipped to assist in the restoration of peace following conflicts in impoverished countries. Repeatedly, a fragile peace has broken down because of the lack of economic follow-up. Despite grand promises of foreign aid, economic reconstruction, and development in Afghanistan, Iraq, Lebanon, and elsewhere, the actual record of international assistance to post-war reconstruction is gravely deficient. The scenario has become painfully familiar. A war ends. An international donors’ conference is called. Pledges of billions of dollars are announced. A smiling new head of state graciously thanks the international community, including the occupying power. Months pass. World Bank teams from Washington start to arrive. But actual reconstruction and recovery is delayed, perhaps for years. Crony businesses from the US and Europe, which are utterly unfamiliar with local conditions, squander time, aid funds, and opportunities. Two or three years pass. The grand pronouncements become a pile of out-of-date World Bank studies. Recriminations fly, the occupying army remains, and a new insurgency spreads. Many factors contribute to this disarray, beginning with the shocking inability of the US, Europe, and the international organizations to understand things from the perspective of poor and displaced people. Their lack of empathy is deplorable, but there are conceptual problems as well. The international agencies involved in post-conflict reconstruction have so far failed to understand how to start or restart economic development in a low-income setting. It’s important to distinguish four distinct phases of outside help to end a conflict. In the first phase, during the war itself, aid is for humanitarian relief, focusing on food, water, emergency medicine, and refugee camps. In the second phase, at the war’s end, aid remains mainly humanitarian relief, but now directed towards displaced people returning home, and to decommissioned soldiers. In the third phase, lasting three to five years, aid supports the first phase of post-war economic development, including restoration of schools, clinics, farms, factories, and ports. In the fourth phase, which can last a generation or more, assistance is directed to long-term investments and the strengthening of institutions such as courts. The international community, and the US in particular, is dreadful at the third stage. Once a conflict is over, aid agencies seem paralyzed. Instead of sending help, they send study groups. There is often a lag of years before moving from humanitarian relief to real economic development. By the time such help actually arrives, it is often too late: war has been re-ignited. In fact, it is possible to restart economic development through targeted “quick-impact” initiatives. Since the economies of most impoverished post-conflict countries are based on agriculture, restarting farm output is vital. Impoverished farmers should receive a free package of seeds, fertilizers, and low-cost equipment (such as pumps for irrigation). When such aid is made available quickly, former soldiers will return to their farms, and can establish a livelihood by the beginning of the first growing season following the end of hostilities. This type of aid does not require long studies, but quick action. Similar quick-impact measures should be undertaken to control disease. Small rural clinics can be built or rebuilt very quickly, within the first year of peace. Solar panels and wind turbines can provide off-grid power in isolated rural areas. Wells and cisterns can be put in place to ensure safe drinking water. These and similar efforts can mean the difference between famine and food security, epidemic disease and health, income and utter poverty, and, most importantly, hope and despair. Yet the window of opportunity closes quickly. Quick-impact economic development is exactly what is needed now to help end the horrific violence and suffering in Darfur. Sanctions, threats, and peacekeepers are only short-term measures, whereas real progress there against extreme poverty is not only achievable, but also is something that the government and rebels can agree on. The same applies in Somalia. But the window of opportunity closes quickly in these and other post-conflict regions. Only by taking quick, meaningful action to fight hunger, poverty, and disease can there be a chance of creating conditions for long-term peace.",
            "实现和平 在叛乱规模越来越大、军阀越来越多、海洛因贸易猖獗、人民大失所望的情况下，阿富汗虚弱的国民政府拼命想要维持自身的合法性和民众的支持，阿富汗国内局势摇摇欲坠。 从阿富汗到东非一线，战火在伊拉克、黎巴嫩、索马里甚至苏丹的达尔富尔地区肆虐燃烧。 政治家、将军甚至外交家有关军事策略和调动的谈论声不绝于耳，但真正符合这些地区需要的政策却截然不同。 只有经济机会才能催生稳定，当越来越多的年轻人能找到工作、养家糊口，而不是靠暴力斗争来改变命运时，才能实现真正的稳定。 我们一再看到无论是阿富汗的北约部队、伊拉克的美国驻军、巴勒斯坦的以色列占领者还是索马里的埃塞俄比亚人，所有这些外国军队能够打胜一场战役，甚至赢得整个战争，但却永远无法实现和平。 和平是尊严，是未来的希望。 军事占领一点一点地消磨人的尊严、折磨人的贫穷和经济混乱慢慢使希望丧失殆尽。 只有撤出外国军队、创造工作机会、建设高效率的农场、企业、发展旅游、医疗和教育，才能最终实现和平。 如果没有这些，军事胜利和占领的喜悦很快就会灰飞烟灭。 事实证明美国政府对这一切视而不见，而国际社会也依然对战后贫困国家重建和平束手无策。 因为没有后续的经济发展，脆弱的和平一而再、再而三地遭到破坏。 尽管阿富汗、伊拉克、黎巴嫩等地无一例外地得到了国外援助、经济重建和发展的慷慨承诺，但真正用于战后重建的国际援助却少得可怜。 情况令人心痛地相似。 战争结束后召集国际捐助大会，会上承诺捐赠成百上千亿美元。 面带笑容的新国家元首礼貌地向包括占领国在内的国际社会致谢。 数月以后，来自华盛顿的世界银行特派小组陆续抵达。 但真正的重建或恢复工作却一拖再拖，也许长达数年之久。 来自美国和欧洲的企业任人唯亲，完全不了解当地的情况，将时间、援助款项和机会浪费殆尽。 两三年过去了。 义正词严的声明变成了一堆过时的世界银行调研报告。 到处能够听到相互指责，占领军还在耀武扬威，新一轮的叛乱又蔓延开去。 造成这种混乱的原因非常复杂，但归根结底，美国、欧洲和国际机构根本不愿为流离失所的穷人考虑是一切混乱的源泉。 他们不会换位思考令人可悲可叹，但与理念有关的问题也急待解决。 参与战后重建的国际机构到目前为止还没有学会如何在低收入环境中启动经济的发展。 找出外来援助结束冲突的四个步骤至关重要。 在第一阶段，也就是战争阶段，援助是为了人道主义目的，重点放在食物、水、急救药品和收容帐篷。 到了第二阶段，也就是战争结束阶段，援助仍然以人道主义目的为主，但现在要侧重于流离失所的百姓和退伍军人重返家园。 第三阶段一般会持续3到5年，援助的任务是启动首阶段的战后经济发展，包括重建学校、诊所、农场、企业和港口。 而第四阶段则需要整整一代人或更长时间的努力，重点更多地放在长期投资，以及加强以法院为首的机构建设。 国际社会，特别是美国，在第三阶段的表现简直糟糕透顶。 一旦战争结束，援助机构似乎就变得束手无策。 他们送去的不是援助，而是派去调研小组。 通常从人道主义援助到真正的经济建设需要花去几年的时间。 等援助真正到位的时候常常已经太迟了：战火已经被再次点燃。 实际上，通过目标明确的“快速起效”方案来迅速启动经济是完全可能的。 因为多数贫困战后国家的经济主要依赖农业，恢复农业生产是至关重要的。 应该向贫困农民免费发放种子、化肥和低成本的器械（比如灌溉用的水泵 ） 。 一旦这些援助迅��到位，从前的士兵就会返回到自己的故里，并在敌对状态结束后通过种植第一季庄稼开始新的生活。 这种援助根本不需要长时间的调研，它所需要的是迅速采取行动。 应该采取同样的迅速起效方案来控制疾病的蔓延。 小型的乡村诊所能够在停火后一年内迅速建设或者重建。 无须建设电网，太阳能电池板和风车也能为偏远的乡村地区提供能源。 可以修建水井和水塔，确保饮用水的安全。 上述措施和类似的努力能够避免饥荒，提供安全食品、消除流行病、确保人民健康、给普通人带来收入，消灭极端贫困，最重要的是，为人们驱除绝望，带来希望的曙光。 但如果没有好好利用，机遇的大门很快就会关上。 迅速见效的经济发展是结束达尔富尔恐怖暴力和灾难的必由之路。 制裁、威胁和维和部队都只是短期的办法，而消除极端贫困的真正进展不仅可以实现，而且能够得到政府和叛乱势力的一致赞同。 索马里的情况也是一样。 但在上面提到的战后地区和其他遭受战火蹂躏的土地，机会的大门很快就会关上。 只有采取迅速、有效的措施来战争饥饿、贫困和疾病，才有机会为长久的和平创造条件。"

            "Winning the Transition WASHINGTON, DC – Is the Arab Spring turning into a gloomy autumn? With brutal crackdowns in Syria, a bloody civil war in Libya, and Yemen teetering on the brink of chaos, the number of skeptics is growing. Although Egypt and Tunisia’s pro-democracy movements achieved rapid regime change, uncertainties remain in those countries, too. After a brief period of hope, many observers now wonder whether the region is capable of producing viable, and economically vibrant, democracies. Revolutions and their aftermaths, of course, are always fluid and fickle times, and the outcome is often perched on a knife’s edge. Bridging the vast gap between high expectations and the reality of limited budgets and capabilities is a test in itself. Redressing past injustice and building an economy that offers opportunity to all are major challenges as well, fraught with volatility, uncertainty, and the dangers of political opportunism. But transitions are also times of great opportunity. In the 1990’s, I was among those Indonesians who demanded and celebrated the departure of our own autocrat, Suharto, and I joined the new government when he left. Many observers predicted that Indonesia, the world’s most populous Muslim country, would be unable to sustain democracy and would ultimately decline into chaos. The task ahead of us was daunting. But we proved the skeptics wrong, and learned some fundamental lessons. Perhaps most importantly, we learned that there is no one-size-fits-all solution for democratization. Each of the countries of the Middle East and North Africa will face unique challenges, which will have to be addressed on their own terms. Even so, they all must make a real and symbolic break with the past. The new authorities must send strong signals that the old ways are finished. Change must be formally manifested, with new laws that are widely publicized. Legislation that empowers citizens with freedom of expression, free and independent elections, and freedom of association is crucial, and it must be made clear to the public that no one is above the law. Anything less will undermine the transition. Moreover, corruption is the bane of development everywhere, so new governments should move fast to establish institutions and procedures to fight it. Transparency and accountability are powerful ideas with near-universal support, which means that new leaders should not give up when the fight becomes difficult. Civil-society organizations, local communities, representatives of the poor and vulnerable, and women play a vital role in this regard, and they should be included at every level of decision-making. In Indonesia, we signed a hundred laws in less than 18 months, covering everything from media freedom to elections, corruption, decentralization, and anti-trust rules. We ratified new public-finance legislation and ensured the independence of the country’s central bank. New leaders must also expect and manage setbacks. In post-revolutionary times, expectations are high, and the obstacles to meeting them are enormous. I know from personal experience that we did not always have the luxury of getting the best outcomes. We had to compromise and settle for the best possible results. Security threats are among the most serious setbacks in transitions. Nationalistic sentiment is strong, and politicians and interest groups can exploit it. Often, the security forces are holdovers from the old regime, and there is no independent judicial system. Reforms will take time, and the old bureaucracies may not be able to implement them. In Indonesia, we used various innovations to work around such dilemmas. For example, we appointed an independent judge to take over the bankruptcy and corruption courts, because career judges were too tainted. Likewise, when we started cash-for-work programs as part of our pro-poor agenda, we asked communities to run these initiatives. More broadly, new leaders are well advised to ensure that the economy performs well. It is important to restore economic activity and create a favorable environment for entrepreneurs, particularly small and medium-size businesses, which constitute the main engine of job creation. The recent revolutions, it should be recalled, started with the self-immolation of a Tunisian fruit vendor, who was harassed and insulted by the authorities. But economic success without accountability and social inclusion is not sustainable, and new governments often must face tough choices in order to protect the poor and vulnerable. They might have to abolish mis-targeted subsidies to free up resources for more targeted and efficient anti-poverty and job-creation programs. In Indonesia, we had to draw a line between the very poor and the near-poor. We could not afford to raise salaries or provide subsidies for everybody. Our help had to be targeted. So, while we helped the neediest, we excluded others who were not poor enough to benefit. This was a tough and unpopular choice. Finally, countries in transition need support – not only money, but also technical know-how to implement highly complex reforms. When I became Indonesia’s finance minister, I had 64,000 employees. But when we had to modernize our tax system, we could not find the required expertise anywhere in our country. Yes, we needed external assistance, but we never surrendered “ownership” of the reform process; we made it work for us. If we Indonesians had not been in charge of our own transition, it could easily have failed. That lesson, too, is one that all countries in transition should bear in mind.",
            "实现转型成功 华盛顿 — — 阿拉伯春天之后阴沉的秋天是否正在来临？ 随着叙利亚的残酷镇压、利比亚的血腥内战和也门在混乱边缘摇摇欲坠，持怀疑态度的人数正迅速攀升。 虽然埃及和突尼斯的民主运动快速实现了政权更替，但这两个国家同样存在不确定性。 在短暂的希望过后，不少观察家现在怀疑该地区能否诞生能独立发展、充满经济活力的民主国家。 当然，革命和革命的结果往往都非常善变，而最终的结果往往系于千钧一发之间。 弥合殷切希望和有限预算和能力之间的鸿沟本身就是一种考验。 纠正既往不公和建设机会均等的经济也是一项充满波动、变数和政治机会主义风险的严峻挑战。 但转型往往也伴随着巨大的机遇。 20世纪90年代，我曾经是要求并且庆祝独裁统治者苏哈托下台的印尼民众的一员，苏哈托离开后我加盟了新的政府。 当时很多观察家预测全世界人口最多的穆斯林国家印尼将无法保持民主制度，并最终陷入到混乱当中。 令人生畏的任务摆在我们面前。 但我们证明了怀疑论者的错误，从中汲取了某些基本的经验。 或许最重要的是，我们体会到没有放之四海皆准的通用民主化方案。 中东和北非的每个国家都面临各自的问题，这些问题的解决必须根据其自身的条件。 即使如此，他们都必须从真正意义上与过去决裂。 新政府必须明确旧的方式已经不复存在。 改革和新的法律必须得到广泛宣传。 赋予公民言论自由、独立自由选举权和集会自由的法案至关重要，必须让公众明白没有人能凌驾于法律之上，否则转型就有可能遭到破坏。 此外，腐败无论在哪里都是发展的祸根，因此新政府必须建立起与之斗争的机构和程序。 透明制和问责制是近乎受到普遍支持的强大思想，也就是说新领袖不应放弃艰苦的斗争。 民间社会组织、地方社团、穷人和弱势群体代表及妇女在这方面所起的作用至关重要，他们必须参与到所有层次的决策当中。 印尼在不到18个月时间里签署了一百部法律，这些法律涉及媒体选举自由、腐败、权力下放和反垄断规则的方方面面。 我们批准了新的公共财政立法，保障印尼央行的独立管理权。 新领导人还必须预想并管理各种困难。 在后革命时代人们的期望值空前高涨，而实现这些期望却面临着巨大的障碍。 我从亲身经历中得知我们并不总能得到最好的结果。 我们必须学会妥协，接受最有可能的结果。 安全威胁是转型过程中最严重的障碍。 民族主义情绪空前高涨，政客和利益团体可能利用民族情绪达到自己的目的。 通常安全部队都来自旧政府的残余势力，独立的司法制度也没有建立。 改革需要时间，而指望旧的官僚机构推进改革可能并不现实。 在印尼，我们采取各式各样的创新措施来解决这种两难局面。 比方说，我们指定一名独立法官接手破产和腐败法庭，因为职业法官已经染上了污点。 同样，当我们启动穷人支持计划付现工作方案的时候，我们请求社会团体来推行这项计划。 更广泛的说，新领导人将得到充分的建议，以确保经济能够进入良性循环。 恢复经济活动并为企业家（特别是中小企业家）创造有利的环境非常重要，因为中小企业是创造就业机会的主要来源。 我们应该记得一位突尼斯水果商人的自焚引发了最近这场革命���这名商人自焚是因为不堪忍受政府的侮辱和骚扰。 但是不具备责任和包容的经济成功不是持久的成功，新政府往往会为保护穷人和弱势群体而面临艰难的抉择。 他们可能需要取消错误的补贴，以节省更多资源用于更有针对性、更加高效的扶贫和就业创造计划。 在印尼，我们不得不区分贫困和近贫人口。 我们没有能力提高工资，或为所有人发放补贴。 我们的帮助必须有针对性。 因此，我们在为最贫困群体提供帮助的同时，也把不够资格享受补贴的人群排除在外。 这项工作既不受欢迎又非常艰难。 最后，转型国家需要支持 — — 其中不仅包括资金，也包括推进高度复杂改革的技术知识。 我担任印尼财政部长期间，手下拥有64，000位员工。 但当我们需要改革税收系统的时候，却找遍全国都没有找到所需的专业人才。 是的，我们需要外部支持，但我们从未放弃对改革的“所有权 ” 。 我们的改革取得了成功。 如果印尼人没有领导我们自身的改革，那么改革很有可能会陷入失败。 所有处于转型时期的国家都应该汲取相关的经验。"

            "Winning with Opium in Afghanistan Despite considerable effort by the international community in Afghanistan since 2001 to eliminate the Taliban and al Qaeda, the insurgency in the south of the country has gathered momentum at breakneck speed in recent months. Our field research shows that we are not winning the campaign for the hearts and minds of the Afghan people – the Taliban are. Indeed, the international community’s methods of fighting the insurgency and eradicating poppy crops have actually helped the insurgents gain power. The international community has so far pursued policies of destruction, rather than the promised reconstruction. The aggressive United States-led counter-narcotics policy of crop eradication has failed to win the support of Afghans, because it has triggered a chain reaction of poverty and violence in which poor farmers, with their only livelihood destroyed, are unable to feed their families. This has been exacerbated by the failure to provide even the most basic aid and development in the country’s poorest areas. At the same time, communities have been torn apart as a result of bombing campaigns, which have destroyed the very homes we came to protect. This, in addition to four years of drought, has forced entire families to leave their villages for makeshift internal refugee camps. You do not win people over by bombing them, but by helping them. The Taliban have exploited the failures of the international community in extremely effective anti-Western propaganda that has fueled significant doubt in the minds of the public concerning the reasons justifying the international presence in Afghanistan. Sadly, our troops are often the first to pay the price – sometimes with their lives. It is not too late to win back the hearts and minds of the Afghan people. International troops are excelling in an exceptionally hostile environment, but this is not a war that will be won by military means alone. With public perception a crucial factor in winning the war, and the Taliban poised to launch a large military initiative next spring, failure to adopt a successful local strategy could signify the last chance the international community will have to build a secure and stable Afghanistan. But a successful strategy – one that responds to Afghanistan’s extreme poverty crisis –requires that the international community reverse course on crop eradication. In fact, the eradication of poppy crops not only damage local communities and undermines the international community’s goals, but it is also failing: opium production last year was at an all-time high. In September, the United Nations Office on Drugs Crime announced that poppy cultivation soared by a record-high 60%. Eradication will never be successful in Afghanistan, because it destroys the single crop that will grow in the south’s harsh climate – and thus serves as the main source of income to millions of people. So a new, long-term, economically sustainable solution is urgently needed – one that directly engages with the communities that are suffering most – in order to achieve the support of the deeply impoverished rural population. As a way to address this dilemma, the Senlis Council is proposing to run scientific pilot projects to research an opium licensing system for Afghanistan, which would be a core component of the economic reconstruction process. A system in which poppy is cultivated under license for the production of pain-killing medicines such as morphine and codeine would allow farmers to pursue their traditional livelihood and way of life, and, more importantly, to feed themselves and their families. There is a global shortage of morphine and codeine, particularly in underdeveloped countries, where these vital medicines are often in short supply, if not completely unavailable. Not only would poppy licensing address the poverty and hunger crises that have engulfed the south of Afghanistan; it also would stabilize existing local structures, giving communities a reason to support President Hamid Karzai’s government and the international community. Farmers would gain a sense of ownership in counter-narcotics efforts, in sharp contrast to the current idealistic – and evidently un-achievable – policy of crop eradication. We must have the backing of the Afghan people if we are to defeat the Taliban. By endorsing such an initiative, the international community would demonstrate that it is in Afghanistan for the good of the local population, which would help farmers sever ties with the insurgency. But for such a system to be successful, the extreme poverty in the south of the country must first be our top priority. According to the World Food Program, 70% of the population lack food security. An immediate injection of emergency food and medical aid is urgently needed to break the vicious circle of suffering and violence. Only then could a new, long-term development strategy in Afghanistan – one that admits that the international community is not winning the war, and that the status quo is unacceptable – be implemented. Licensing the opium crop would be a realistic and pragmatic cornerstone of that strategy’s success.",
            "以鸦片制胜阿富汗 尽管国际社会自2001年以来在铲除塔利班和“基地组织”方面付出了巨大的努力，但近几个月来，该国南部叛乱的形势还是以非常危险的速度发展着。 实地调查表明，我们正在赢得阿富汗民心的较量中落败—而塔利班却正在胜出。 的确，国际社会对抗叛乱和铲除罂粟作物的方式其实助长了叛乱分子的力量。 国际社会到目前为止推行的是摧毁政策，而不是所承诺的重建。 美国领导下的激进的铲除种植的反毒品政策没有赢得阿富汗人民的支持，因为它引发了一系列贫困和暴力的连锁反应。 当贫穷农民唯一的生计被破坏以后，他们就连养家糊口也成了问题。 由于未能在该国最贫穷的地区提供哪怕最基本的发展援助，更加剧了这一局面的恶化。 同时，由于轰炸攻势使得居民社区支离破碎。 我们摧毁了本应受到保护的目标。 这一因素，加上长达四年的干旱，迫使许多家庭背井离乡，安顿到国内难民营的临时棚户中。 轰炸得不了人心，而援助才是正道。 塔利班在他们极为有效的反西方宣传战中利用了国际社会的失败。 这些宣传加深了公众对在阿富汗的国际干预合法性的质疑。 悲哀的是，我们的部队常常是首先付出代价的人—有时是生命的代价。 现在要赢得阿富汗的民心还为时不晚。 国际部队在极端敌对的环境中保持着优势，但这场战争单靠武力是不能获胜的。 在民意成为制胜的关键因素，而塔利班又做足准备在明年春季发动一场大规模军事行动的情况下，如果不能采取成功的本地战略，那么就意味着国际社会将失去在阿富汗建立安全和稳定的最后机会。 但是一个成功的战略—一个应对阿富汗的极端贫困危机的战略—需要国际社会在铲除鸦片的问题上反其道而行之。 实际上，铲除罂粟作物不但破坏了当地民生、阻碍了国际社会实现其目标，而且也是失败的：去年的鸦片生产创历史新高。 在九月，联合国毒品犯罪办公室宣布罂粟种植创纪录地增长了60 % 。 铲除罂粟种植在阿富汗永远不会成功，因为它摧毁的是唯一一种能在南方的恶劣气候中生长的作物—而它又是上百万人的主要收入来源。 所以，现在急需一个新的、长期的、并且在经济层面上可持续的解决方案—一个与最困苦的当地社区直接相关的方案—从而赢得最贫困的农村人口的支持。 作为摆脱困境的途径之一 ， “ 森利斯委员会 ” （ Senlis Council）正提议为研究针对阿富汗的鸦片许可体系而进行科学试点项目。 这可能会成为经济重建进程中的一个核心组成部分。 它是一种为生产吗啡和可待因等止痛药而特许种植罂粟的制度。 这种制度能让农民继续他们传统的谋生方式，更重要的是可以让他们养家糊口。 全球的吗啡和可待因供应短缺。 特别在欠发达国家，这些重要药品即便不是没有也是紧缺的。 罂粟种植许可制度不仅可以缓解笼罩在阿富汗南部的贫穷和饥饿危机；它还能稳定现有的本地架构，给与当地社会足够的理由支持卡尔扎伊总统的政府和国际社会。 与现行的、理想主义的—且明显难以为继的—铲除行动形成鲜明对比的，是农民们在反毒品的计划中还能获得一种主人翁的感觉。 如果要击败塔利班，我们必须要有阿富汗人民的支持。 通过采取如是的举措，国际社会可以证明它在阿富汗的目的是为了当地民众的利益，从而帮助农民切断与叛乱的联系。 但这样一个体系要取得成功，该国南方的赤贫问题就是我们的当务之急。 据“世界粮食计划”统计，当地70%的人口缺少食品安��。 马上输入紧急食物和医疗援助是打破困苦和暴力的恶性循环所急需的。 只有到那时，一个在阿富汗的新的长期发展战略—一个承认国际社会正在战争中落败，且当前形势不可接受的战略—才能付诸实施。 鸦片种植许可制度会是这一战略成功的一个现实而切实的里程碑。"

            "The Western Alliance in the Digital Age MUNICH – This weekend, Helmut Schmidt and Henry Kissinger will participate in a discussion at the Munich Security Conference (MSC) – just as they did a half-century ago, when they took part in the first “Internationale Wehrkunde-Begegnung” (the forerunner of today’s conference). In the meantime, many developments around the world have given us reason to rejoice – but also to reflect. It is not only the crises extending from Ukraine to Syria that will prevent the MSC, the fiftieth, from becoming an exercise in self-celebration. The transatlantic partnership, traditionally the backbone of the conference, has seen better days than these. The United States has now at least recognized that a great deal of trust has been lost in recent months, owing to the scale of surveillance undertaken by its National Security Agency. President Barack Obama’s speech about reforms of US intelligence-gathering activities, as well as his subsequent interview on German television, represented a first attempt to regain the confidence of America’s allies. But it signals, at most, the beginning of an intensive transatlantic dialogue on the issue. The topic is too broad to be discussed solely among governments and secret services. What we need is a more comprehensive international debate that engages, say, the American and German publics, as well as the US Congress and the German Bundestag – in short, an intra-Western debate about our relationship in the digital age. In 1963, when Ewald von Kleist invited participants to Munich for the first conference, which Americans fondly call the “Wehrkunde” to this day, the motivating idea was to invite our most important allies to a discussion about the major strategic issues directly affecting Germany and NATO. The main topic, at that time, was the Atlantic Alliance’s nuclear strategy. After all, Germany would have been the first victim of a nuclear confrontation between NATO and the Warsaw Pact countries. Kleist wanted to contribute to the creation of a German “strategic community,” which could make its own contributions to the NATO debate, rather than just absorbing whatever their technologically superior US ally proposed. In a way, we are in a similar situation today. Though the security implications of the digital age are less tangible and not as destructive as a nuclear attack, the technological possibilities fundamentally alter the playing field of international relations. The revelations concerning the NSA’s surveillance activities are just the start. A future of “thinking drones” and defensive and offensive cyber weapons raises new ethical, legal, and political questions. We Europeans need to be self-critical and admit that we are not only lagging behind in terms of technical capabilities; we are also in danger of not fully grasping in time the possibilities and dangers of the digital world. And of course, we will hardly be able to engage in meaningful negotiations with the Americans on cyber issues unless we succeed in establishing a united stance within the European Union. Doing so would put us in far better position to negotiate on equal terms with the US, just as we can on trade issues. In the past, the Western allies’ participation in NATO and its Nuclear Planning Group accommodated their concerns and prevented them from becoming mere objects of US strategy. Today, we need similar initiatives with regard to the digital world. Those hoping to achieve true cooperation must be willing to make their own contributions. This year’s MSC will include not only security officials from many countries. Three dozen German MPs and a significant US Congressional delegation will also participate. That is why the conference is an excellent opportunity to step up the transatlantic debate. After all, let’s be honest: there will be real changes in US intelligence agencies’ behavior only if Congress regulates their activities more strictly. The revelations and resulting debates in recent months have shown that many US politicians are also uneasy about the liberties taken by the secret services. However, without domestic pressure, little will change. It is all the more important that societal stakeholders – companies, NGOs, or international commissions of experts – both here and in the US become more heavily involved than before. This issue affects us all. The debate is not – and should not be – between Europe and the US. Some Americans are grateful for Edward J. Snowden’s revelations about the NSA, which they believe have stimulated urgently needed public deliberation. The institutionally assured possibility of self-criticism is, arguably, the West’s best characteristic – its outstanding trait. Our democracies are better organized than other systems to scrutinize their own policies and respond to criticism. In the 1960’s, the West had to agree on a common strategy for the nuclear age, and learn to deal with the atomic threat. Subsequently, we were able to take the first steps toward arms control and disarmament. Today, we need a similar debate in the West regarding our strategy for the digital age if we want to overcome new challenges without denying our identity as liberal democracies. This weekend in Munich, the Schmidts and Kissingers of today and tomorrow will have an opportunity to engage in what is probably the most important strategic debate of our time: how to prevent the West from falling apart inthe digital age.",
            "数字时代的西方联盟 慕尼黑—这个周末，赫尔穆特·施密特（Helmut Schmidt）和亨利·基辛格将在慕尼黑安全会议（MSC）上参与讨论 — — 半个世纪前，��MSC的前身第一次举办时，他们就曾经参与过讨论。 与此同时，世界各地的许多发展趋势让我们兴奋，也让我们深思。 让第十五届MSC无法成为欢庆舞台的不仅仅是乌克兰和叙利亚危机的发酵。 大西洋两岸的伙伴关系，MSC的传统基石也不如以前那样牢固了。 如今，美国至少已经意识到，因为其国家安全局的监控行为，它在最近几个月损失了很多的信任。 总统奥巴马关于美国情报搜集行动改革的演讲以及随后参与的德国电视访问算得上重新争取美国盟友信任的第一批动作。 但这充其量只是开始加强关于这一问题的跨大西洋对话的信号。 这个主题所涉太广，无法只在政府和秘密机构间讨论。 我们需要的是一场更全面的国际讨论，包括（比如）美国和德国公众以及美国国会和德国联邦议会 — — 简言之，这应该是一场关于我们在数字时代的关系的泛西方的讨论。 1963年，克莱斯特（Ewald von Kleist）来到慕尼黑参加美国人今天天真地称为“Wehrkunde”的第一届会议，其初衷是邀请我们最重要的盟友讨论直接影响德国和北约的重大战略问题。 当时的主要议题是北约的核战略。 毕竟如果北约和华约爆发核冲突，德国将是首当其冲者。 克莱斯特希望推动成立德国的“战略社区 ” ， 进而在北约的讨论中起到作用，而不仅仅是唯其名义上的上级美国的马首是瞻。 从某种程度上说，如今我们面临相同的局面。 与核打击相比，数字时代的安全影响并不那么有形，也不那么具有破坏性，尽管如此，技术可行性仍从根本上改变了国际关系竞技场。 美国国安局监控行为只是揭开了冰山一角。 未来的“思想无人机”和防御性和进攻性网络武器将带来新的伦理、法律和政治问题。 我们欧洲人需要自我批判并承认我们不但拖了技术能力的后腿；我们还有可能无法在第一时间把握数字世界的可能性和危险性。 当然，除非我们在欧盟内部成功形成了统一战线，否则不可能与美国人展开有意义的谈话。 实现这一目标能让我们更加有利地与美国展开平等谈判，正如我们在贸易问题上做得那样。 在过去，西方盟国加入北约及其核计划集团（Nuclear Planning Group）安抚了它们的担忧，也防止了它们沦为美国战略的目标。 如今，我们需要在数字世界做同样的安排。 要想形成真正的合作就必须做出自己的贡献。 今年的MSC不仅将包括来自多个国家的安全官员。 三十六位德国联邦议会议员和庞大的美国国会代表团也将出席。 正因如此，本届会议将是建立跨大西洋讨论的绝佳机会。 毕竟，我们应该坦承，只有国会更严格地规范其行为，美国情报机构的行动才会发生实质改变。 最近几个月以来的事件发酵和由此带来的争论表明，许多美国政客也对秘密机构干涉自由深感忧虑。 但是，没有国内压力就不可能出现多少变化。 欧洲和美国的社会各界 — — 公司、非政府组织或国际专家委员会 — — 比从前更积极地加入其中是至关重要的。 这一问题影响着我们所有人。 这一讨论不是 — — 也不应该是 — — 欧洲和美国的讨论。 一些美国人也感谢斯诺登（Edward J. Snowden）揭发国安局，他们认为这刺激了急需的公共思考。 有制度保证的自我批判是西方最优秀的品质，也是它的突出特征。 我们的民主制度在监督我们自己的政策和相应批评方面比其他制度更加井井有条。 20世纪60年代，西方需要在核时代的共同战略上达成一致，并研究如何应对原子威胁。 随后，我们就迈出了通向核武器控制和去核化的第一步。 如今，西方需要类似的讨论思考信息时代战略，如果我们想克服新挑战又不否定我们的自由民主国家身份的话。 在本周末的慕尼黑，当代和未来施密特们和基辛格们将有机会参与可能是现时代最重要的战略讨论：如何防止西方在数字时代落于人后。"

            "Germany’s Same Old Foreign Policy MUNICH – More than ten weeks after its general election, Germany continues to be without a new government. But, though the post-election coalition negotiations have been unusually prolonged, there is little disagreement between the parties over foreign and security policy. Indeed, when Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union and the Social Democratic Party (SPD) finally presented their coalition agreement on November 27, the working group on foreign and security policy had been finished with its job for two weeks. Except for a few tweaks that generally resonate more at home than with Germany’s European and international partners (such as requiring the government to be more transparent concerning arms exports to autocratic regimes), continuity and caution will remain the watchwords of German foreign and security policy. Observers may disagree about whether German leaders’ stance provides a welcome sign of reliability or reflects a lamentable lack of diplomatic ambition. Those who hope for more active German leadership may well be disappointed by the new government. Big ideas, or even big questions, are notably absent from the coalition agreement. This is very much a reflection of many Germans’ views about themselves and their future: they are comfortable with the status quo, see no need for further reform proposals, are not interested in grand strategy, and would largely prefer to be left alone. Consider NATO policy. Successive German governments have maintained that the alliance should be, or even is, the place to discuss and decide on key security challenges. But Germany has at times been rather reluctant to take crisis issues to NATO headquarters. And when it comes to provision of military and civilian security beyond what the coalition agreement calls “our geographic neighborhood,” the incoming government will favor enabling other regional organizations to do the job. Or consider the question of Turkey’s accession to the European Union. Continuing disagreement between the coalition partners will not permit a proactive German role. Instead, the compromise solution will be no solution: neither yes nor no. At the same time, some interesting new perspectives appear in the coalition agreement. For starters, the United States’ strategic “pivot” to the Asia-Pacific region is described as an opportunity for Europe to assert a coordinated foreign policy that finally plays a role in the development of cooperative policies in the region. Moreover, to encourage this outcome, the coalition agreement promises that the government will “adopt new initiatives to strengthen and deepen the Common Foreign and Security Policy” after the EU summit in December 2013. It includes a call for an annual European Council session on security and defense, as well as for a strategic debate about the purpose of EU foreign relations. In addition, the German government will support European defense integration and maintain the establishment of a European army as a long-term goal. This may not amount to much in practice, but the language in this section is much less tepid than elsewhere. Finally, the coalition agreement responds to concerns about Germany’s ability to be a reliable partner in NATO and EU military missions in a potentially more integrated EU defense organization. According to a 1994 ruling by Germany’s Constitutional Court, the German parliament has the final say when it comes to deploying soldiers. However, Germany’s partners will hardly agree to integrate forces further if the German parliament were to retain a veto over their deployment. The coalition partners disagree about how urgent it is to sort out this issue. Nonetheless, they have agreed that, within a year, a commission will provide different options and models to protect the German parliament’s rights while providing assurances to Germany’s European partners that the country will be a reliable contributor to troop deployments. Should the SPD, which will vote on the coalition agreement in early December, block the formation of the new government (an unlikely development but not entirely out of the question), disputes over security and defense affairs would not be the culprit. Aside from a few minor particulars, consensus prevails. For some, that is a cause for ambivalence. “I do not like the idea that Germany plays itself up to impose its will on others,” German President Joachim Gauck said recently. “Yet neither do I like the idea that Germany plays itself down to eschew risks or solidarity.” Whether German foreign policy can and should do more is a reasonable question. To some degree, the new coalition will feel the pressure and consider the necessity to assume more responsibility for international leadership. But it will respond ever so slowly and ever so carefully. The bottom line is this: Expect no surprises from Germany. Considering how difficult it has been for some, if not most, other EU countries to deal with the challenges of the last five years, that is actually rather good news.",
            "德国外交政策老方一帖 慕尼黑—大选已经过去十周，德国仍没有产生新政府。 但是，尽管选举后的执政联盟谈判时间反常地长，在外交和安全政策上各党派之间并无多少分歧。 事实上，当总理默克尔的基督教民主联盟（Christian Democratic Union）和社会民主党（Social Democratic Party ，SDP）在11月27日最终宣布执政联盟协议时，外交和安全政策工作小组已经完工了两个星期。 除了一些总体上在国内比与德国的欧洲和国际伙伴引起更多共鸣的微调之外（比如要求政府在对专制政权武器出口的问题上更透明 ） ， 连续性和谨慎仍将是德国外交和安全政策的关键词。 观察者可能对德国领导人的立场代表着可靠的积极信号还是反映了可悲的缺少外交雄心有不同见解。 希望看到德国领导人更加积极的人可能会对新政府感到失望。 执政联盟协议的一个显著特征是看不见大思想，甚至连大问题都没有。 这在很大程度上反映了许多德国人对自己和未来的看法：对现状踌躇满志，认为没有必要进行进一步改革，也对宏大战略不感兴趣，宁可独自冷眼旁观。 就拿北约政策来说。 连续几届德国政府都坚持该联盟应该成为 — — 甚至已经是 — — 讨论和决定重要安全挑战事宜的场所。 但德国时不时会不愿意将危机问题拿到北约总部讨论。 而在超越执政联盟协议所谓的“我们的地理邻居”范围之外的军事和民事安全问题，新一届政府更愿意让地区性组织来承担责任。 或者拿土耳其加入欧盟的问题来说。 执政联盟伙伴一直存在分歧将让德国无法占据主动。 相反，妥协方案也不是方案：既非是，也非否。 与此同时，���些有趣的新方面出现在执政联盟协议中。 首先，美国的亚太地区战略“支点”被描述成欧洲主张最终能在该地区合作政策发展中起到作用的协作外交政策的机会。 此外，为了促进这一结果，执政联盟协议承诺政府将在2013年12月的欧盟峰会后“采取新措施强化和深化共同外交和安全政策（Common Foreign and Security Policy ） ” 。 其中包括呼吁增加一个关于安全和防务的欧盟理事会年度议程，以及一个关于欧盟外交关系的战略性讨论。 此外，德国政府将支持欧洲的防务一体化，并把建立欧洲军队作为长期目标。 或许这不会大规模落实，但这一部分的用词比其他部分都要温和。 最后，执政联盟协议回应了关于德国成为北约的可靠伙伴的能力以及未来一体化的欧盟防务组织中的欧盟军事任务的疑虑。 根据1994年德国宪法法院判决，德国议会对于调遣军队问题拥有最终决定权。 但是，如果德国议会握有兵力部署否决权，那么伙伴国是不会同意武装力量的进一步一体化的。 关于如何厘清这一问题，执政联盟没有达成一致。 尽管如此，它们同意在一年内通过一个委员会提出不同观点和模式以保护德国议会的权利，同时向德国的欧洲伙伴国保证德国将是军事部署的可靠积极因素。 12月初，SPD将就执政联盟协议投票。 如果SPD不通过新政府的形成（可能性微乎其微，但不能完全排除 ） ， 罪魁并不在安全和防务事务的争议。 除了极少数次要方面，其余都以形成了一致。 对一些人来说，这造成了矛盾心理。 “我不喜欢德国妄尊自大、将自己的意愿强加于他人的说法 ， ” 德国总统高克最近如是说 ， “ 但我也不喜欢德国妄自菲薄、逃避风险和团结的说法 。 ” 德国外交政策是否可以以及应该做得更多是一个合理的问题。 从某种程度上说，新执政联盟会感到压力，并认为有必要承担更多的国际领导责任。 但它会以极慢极谨慎的方式作出反应。 总而言之，不要期望从德国身上收获惊喜。 考虑到一些（如果不是大部分的话）欧盟国家在过去五年中应对挑战的艰难，这实际上是一个大大的好消息。"

            "Wolfowitz and the World Bank at Bay Will World Bank President Paul Wolfowitz’s troubles finally catalyze real change at the World Bank? Will there finally be an end to the archaic practice by which the President of the United States unilaterally appoints the head of the world’s most important development agency? Facing an extraordinary rebuke from the Bank’s ministerial oversight committee and open revolt from his professional staff, Wolfowitz has faint hope of limping through the last three years of his term. The immediate uproar is over the exceedingly generous pay and promotion package that Wolfowitz awarded in 2005 to his girlfriend as compensation for leaving the Bank to pave the way for his arrival. At a time when the Bank has been emphasizing high governance standards as the key to development, the recent revelation of that arrangement’s details have dealt a serious blow to the Bank’s credibility. But even if Wolfowitz is eventually forced to resign, nothing will be gained if US President George W. Bush is allowed summarily to choose his replacement, as US Presidents have been doing ever since the Bank was founded after World War II. Instead, the Bank’s head should be chosen in an open and transparent process that aims to select the best-qualified candidate, whether from the US, Europe, or the developing world. Indeed, a big part of Wolfowitz’s weakness today is the way he came to his job, as an in-your-face appointment from a US administration weak at international cooperation. The World Bank is a development finance institution. But Wolfowitz’s background at the US State and Defense Departments gave him no real expertise or experience in either area. Instead, his claim to fame was his role as architect of America’s failed war in Iraq. By all accounts, Wolfowitz is brilliant, but it seems inconceivable that an open, transparent, and multilateral selection process would have chosen him to head the World Bank. I reach this conclusion even though I am sympathetic to the Bush administration’s desire to catalyze change at the Bank. I have long advocated shifting the Bank’s center of gravity from lending to outright grants, a policy that the Bush administration strongly endorses. But choosing someone with no obvious background or experience in economic development was not the way to make progress on this front. A more open selection process, indeed, would have zoomed in on the fact that Wolfowitz’s girlfriend worked at the Bank. This may seem a trivial issue, but it is not, given the Bank’s strong policies to protect against nepotism. If Wolfowitz were otherwise overwhelmingly the most qualified candidate, the selection committee may have found a way to finesse the issue, openly and transparently. But, given his questionable fit for the job in the first place, the girlfriend issue might have been disqualifying. Why does the world meekly go along with the status quo and let the US dictate the Bank’s top position? It is a sorry tale of poor global governance. Europe does not get in America’s way because it wants to maintain Europe’s equally out-dated privilege of appointing the head of the International Monetary Fund, the Bank’s sister institution. Asia has little choice but to defer to the US and Europe’s shenanigans because it is grossly under-represented in both organizations. As for Africa, its leaders are loath to do or say anything that might interrupt the flow of World Bank largesse. Many people, including myself, have long complained about the leadership selection process at the World Bank and the IMF. How can the Bank and the Fund continue to go around lecturing developing economies on good governance and transparency but fail to allow change in their own houses? Now and again, both organizations pay lip service to the issue. But so far, they have exhibited no real desire for change. To be fair, the IMF’s leadership is making a determined effort to give dynamic emerging economies, particularly in Asia, a bigger say in Fund governance. If carried far enough, this process would ultimately catalyze the necessary changes. Unfortunately, the IMF’s rebalancing efforts are proceeding at a glacial pace. At the World Bank, nothing seems to be happening at all. Perhaps when Gordon Brown becomes the UK’s next prime minister, he will be able to convince the G7 group of rich countries to lead the charge for change. As head of the Fund’s ministerial oversight committee, Brown understands the issues as well as anyone. Or perhaps the Wolfowitz debacle will prove to be the catalyst. Maybe at last, the next World Bank or IMF president will come from outside their usual domains. There are plenty of great potential non-American candidates. South African Finance Minister Trevor Manuel has ably served as head of the World Bank’s oversight committee and would make a brilliant World Bank president. And it still could be a qualified American. What about Bill Clinton? One way or the other, the Bank and the IMF leadership selection process urgently needs to be revamped. What the Wolfowitz debacle tells us most clearly is that the time for patience with the status quo is over.",
            "陷入困境的沃尔福威茨和世界银行 世界银行总裁沃尔福威茨的困局是否会最终引发该行真正的变革呢？ 是否会最终废止古老的做法，也就是由美国总统单方面指定全世界最为重要的发展机构的领导人呢？ 沃尔福威茨现在面临着世界银行部长监督委员会的指责以及该行员工的公开反叛，能够苟延渡过最后三年任期的机会渺茫。 造成众怒的直接原因是沃尔福威茨在2005年提拔其女友以及极为大度的加薪以便其离开世界银行来为沃尔福威茨就任铺平道路。 在世界银行强调较高的管理标准作为发展的关键的时候，这一项安排的细节曝光对该行的信誉度是一个沉重的打击。 但是，即使沃尔福威茨最终被迫辞职，如果美国总统布什像二战后世界银行成立以来的历届总统那样可以随意选择其接班人，那么，这还是于事无补。 相反，世界银行的领导人应当在一个公开和透明的程序中做出选择，这一程序的目的在于挑选最为称职的候选人，而无论其来自美国、欧洲抑或是发展中世界。 确实，沃尔福威茨现在的弱点的很大一部分是其任职的方式，也就是在由一个在国际合作上无所作为的美国政府专横地加以任命。 世界银行是一个发展金融组织。 但是沃尔福威茨在美国国务院和国防部的背景并不给他在任何一个领域提供实际的专长和经验。 相反，其名声在外之处却是作为美国失败的伊拉克战争的设计师角色。 总体而言，沃尔福威茨是出众的，但是，一个公开、透明以及多边遴选程序挑选他领导世界银行是难以想象的。 尽管我同情布什政府促进世界银行变革的愿望，但是我还是得出这一结论。 我长久以来主张将该行的重心从贷款转移到直接赠款之上，布什政府强烈支持这一政策。 但是挑选某一没有明显经济发展背景或经验的人并不是在这一领域取得进展的途径。 确实，更为公开的遴选程序将会突出沃尔福威茨的女友在该行供职这一事实。 这看似小事，但是鉴于世界银行严格的防止裙带关系政策，实则不然。 如果沃尔福威茨是一个毫无争议、最为合格的候选人，那么，挑选委员会就可以公开和透明地找到妥善处理此事的办法。 但是，由于他首先是否适宜担任此职就令人质疑，女友问题就可能令其不适宜这一职务了。 为何世界顺从当前的局面并且让美国独裁世界银行的最高职务呢？ 这是一个不幸的全球管理不善事件。 欧洲并不想干涉美国，因为它想要维持欧洲所有的、同样也是过时的任命世界银行姊妹组织国际货币基金组织总裁的特权。 亚洲除了听从美国和欧洲的把戏之外选择不多，因为在这两个组织内它的代表权不够。 至于非洲，其领导人们不愿做或者说任何可能打断世界银行施舍的事情。 包括我本人在内的许多人一直抱怨世界银行和国际货币基金组织的领导人遴选过程。 世界银行和国际货币基金组织如何能够继续向发展中经济体讲授良好管理和透明而又不在其自身机构中允许改革呢？ 现在，两个组织都是再一次对这一问题文过饰非。 但是目前为止，它们还没有表现出变革的欲望。 公平而言，国际货币基金组织的领导层正在做出坚定的努力来给充满活力的新兴经济体，特别是亚洲在该组织管理中更大的发言权。 如果进行的足够多的话，这一进程将最终促进引发必要的变革。 不幸的是，国际货币基金组织的重心平衡的努力进展过于缓慢。 在世界银行，好像根本就无动于衷。 可能当布朗成为英国下任首相之际，他将会能够说服七国集团率先变革。 作为国际货币基金组织部长监督委员会主席，布朗与其他人一样理解这些问题。 或许，沃尔福威茨的惨败会成为变革因素。 可能最终下一任国际货币基金组织或者世界银行的总裁会来自通常的领地以外。 有许多不错的非美国籍的候选人。 南非财政部长曼努埃尔出色地担任了世界银行监督委员会的主席，可以成为该行杰出的总裁。 当然也会有合格的美国人选。 克林顿如何？ 不管怎样，世界银行和国际货币基金组织的领导层遴选进程急需改革。 沃尔福威茨惨败告诉我们最为清楚的是，对现状的耐心已经结束了。"

            "Women and Development COPENHAGEN – A girl born in South Asia or sub-Saharan Africa faces a cruel double burden. She will grow up in a region beset by poverty, disease, war or famine. She will also confront these challenges with the added disadvantage of being female. Although more attention is being given to gender issues, inequality persists in every culture, country, and continent. A new study for the Copenhagen Consensus project shows that eliminating this disparity is an investment with high payoffs. Despite global interest in education for all, many girls in poor countries continue to be denied basic education; right from the start, they are disadvantaged. Three in five illiterate children in the world are girls. Particularly in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, cultural norms and economic hardships stop parents from sending their daughters to school or from keeping them in school for as long as they enroll their sons. This unequal investment is neither equitable nor efficient. An obvious solution is to build more schools in places where girls and boys must be educated separately. In poor Muslim countries like Pakistan, Yemen, and Morocco, single-sex schooling is the norm, but many rural areas can afford only one public school, which is usually set aside for boys. In theory, about half of the education gap in these areas could be closed by building girls’ schools. Elsewhere, supply constraints are not the problem. Instead, policymakers must find ways to strengthen the incentives for parents to send their daughters to school. In countries where the family’s cost of schooling girls is lowered either by a no-fee policy or by a stipend for girls who enroll in school, girls’ enrollment rate increases. The experiences of these few countries lead us to propose a system whereby mothers are paid if their school-age daughters attend school regularly from the 3rd to the 9th grade. This would increase girls’ enrollment and also put money into women’s hands – important because studies show that money given to women is more likely to provide positive nutritional and health benefits for their children than money given to men. It also provides the women with greater bargaining power in their own households. The annual cost per pupil would be $32. Covering every eligible girl in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia for a year would cost $6 billion. Benefits from increased future wages and the reduction in health-care use would be between three and 26 times higher. Pregnancy is one of the most vulnerable times for poor women; 99% of the 529,000 women who die annually from pregnancy-related complications live in developing countries. Severe malnutrition and the absence of prenatal care during pregnancy put both mother and child at serious risk. Spending $3.9 billion on family planning and maternal health initiatives, such as provision of emergency contraception in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, could avert 1.4 million infant deaths and 142,000 pregnancy-related deaths in women. Making reproductive services available to women who cannot afford to pay their way can help prevent these deaths. But such services must not shy away from promoting and providing modern contraceptive methods to avoid unwanted pregnancies. Nearly 20% of women in developing countries report that they would like to stop having more children but are not using any form of contraception or family planning, possibly because reproductive services are not available. For adolescent girls, early marriage or an unwanted pregnancy typically curtails schooling. Delaying marriage and childbearing allows them to gain more education and perhaps more earning opportunities, as well as improved health, education, and labor market success for their future children – benefits worth ten times more than the cost of providing reproductive services. Other tools, aside from schooling, can help women improve their income-earning ability. Microfinance institutions, such as Bangladesh’s Grameen Bank, play a vital role in allowing self-employed women to build profitable businesses. Small loans empower women by giving them more control over household assets and resources, more autonomy and decision-making power, and greater access to participation in public life. Women are more likely than men to meet regular repayments and to spend their earnings on children’s health and education. Policymakers should continue to facilitate the rollout of microfinance programs. Studies show that each dollar loaned by a microfinance institution increases household expenditure by almost 10% in the first year, and that the benefits will continue for another 30 years. Benefits are estimated to end up about six times higher than the costs. Though women have the right to vote in almost every country, gender inequalities in political representation remain large. Governments should consider gender quotas at the local level of politics. Greater female representation may not necessarily lead to more emphasis on “female” policy priorities, but in India, village councils with gender quotas for village chiefs have higher levels of safe drinking water, better immunization coverage and roads, and less bribery. There may be some losses from electing women because they tend to have less political experience than men, but the record in India suggests that if it took 20 years to establish a 30% share of women in local positions in other countries, the benefits would be at least double the costs of achieving this. Being a woman need not and should not be among the greatest challenges of life.",
            "女性和发展 哥本哈根—一个出生在南亚和撒哈拉沙漠以南非洲地区的女童面临着残酷的双重负担。 她将会在一个充满贫穷、疾病、战争或饥荒的地区成长。 她还要带着身为女性的弱势来面对这些挑战。 虽然性别问题已经被给予了更多的关注，但不平等现象仍然在各个文化、国家和大陆存在着。 一项关于哥本哈根共识项目的新近研究表明消除这些不平等是一项高回报的投资。 尽管有全球在普及教育方面的努力，但许多贫穷国家的女童仍然被剥夺了基本教育的权利；从一开始，她们就是弱势群体。 世界上文盲儿童中的五分之三是女童。 特别是在南亚和撒哈拉以南非洲地区，文化传统和经济艰辛阻止了父母让他们的女儿上学，或让她们在学校里接受与儿子们同等时间的教育。 这种不平等的投资既不公平又很低效。 一种显而易见的解决方案就是在男女不能同校的地方建立更多的学校。 在许多贫穷的穆斯林国家，如巴基斯坦、也门和摩洛哥，单一性别学校是一种传统，但许多农村地区只能负担一所公立学校，而这所学校往往是针对男童的。 从理论上讲，通过建立女子学校，这些地区的男女入学差距可以被缩小近一半。 在其他地方，物力制约不是问题。 政策制定者们必须想办法强化让父母们将女儿送去读书的激励机制。 在那些降低了家庭让女童接受教育的成本的国家（不论是通过免学费还是为女童入学提供补贴 ） ， 女童的入学率都增加了。 这几个国家的经验让我们提议建立这样的一个体系：如果学龄的女儿们从三年级到九年级正常上学，那么她们的母亲将得到报酬，既增加女童的入学率又增加女性的收入—这是非常重要的，因为研究显示相较于男性，女性更会将得到的资助用于向她们的子女提供积极的营养和健康福利。 这也使女性在自己的家庭中更有发言权。 每一个小学生一年的教育成本是32美元。 让撒哈拉以南非洲和南亚的所有适龄女童接受教育的年成本是60亿美元。 而从未来薪资增加和医疗费用降低中获得的收益要（比这成本）高3到26倍。 妊娠期是贫穷妇女最为脆弱的时期之一；每年死于与妊娠有关的并发症的529000名妇女中，有99%都在发展中国家。 严重的营养不良和妊娠期的产前护理缺失让母亲和小孩面临严重的风险。 在计划生育和妇科医疗方面（如在撒哈拉以南非洲和南亚地区提供紧急避孕服务）支出39亿美元，可以避免140万婴儿死亡和142000桩与妊娠相关的妇女死亡。 向经济上无力负担的女性提供生殖服务有助于避免这些死亡。 但这些服务决不能羞于推广和提供现代避孕方法，从而避免意外怀孕。 发展中国家近20%的妇女表示不愿再生育更多的小孩，但却没有采用任何的避孕或计划生育措施。 这可能是因为生殖服务缺位。 对青春期女童而言，早婚和意外怀孕通常会打断她们的教育。 推迟结婚和生育能让她们获得更多的教育、更多的收入机会以及为他们未来的子女获得更好的医疗、教育和就业市场的成功—这样的收益是生殖服务成本的十倍。 除了学校教育之外的其它工具能够帮助女性提高她们创收的能力。 微型金融机构，如孟加拉国的Grameen银行，在让从事自由职业的妇女创业赢利方面发挥了关键作用。 小额贷款通过给予女性对家庭资产和资源更多控制权、更多自主和决策权以及更多参与公共生活的机会，提升了她们的权利。 女性比男性更可能按时还款并将她们的收入用于子女的健康和教育。 政策制定者们应该继续为微型金融项目的实施提供方便。 研究表明微型金融机构贷出的每一美元在第一年会使家庭支出增加10 % ， 而且这种收益会持续30年。 据估计总收益将比成本高6倍。 虽然在几乎所有的国家女性都获得了选举权，但在政治代表上的性别不平等仍然严重。 政府应该考虑地方政治中的性别配额。 更高的女性代表率不一定产生对“女性”政策优先的重视，但在印度，对村民委员会的委员有性别配额要求的地方，饮用水安全程度更高、疫苗接种率更高、路况更好，贿赂的情况也更少。 女性当选可能会有一些缺憾，因为她们相较于男性政治经验往往不足。 但从印度的经验来看，如果花20年的时间使其他国家的地方官员中女性的比例达到30 % ， 那么其产生的收益至少是实现这一目标所耗成本的两倍。 身为女性不需要也不应该成为生活中最大的挑战之一。"

            "A Woman-Focused Climate Agenda LONDON – From teen activist Greta Thunberg’s much-publicized transatlantic journey on a zero-emissions boat to attend the United Nations General Assembly to the proliferation of climate protests, the world is more aware than ever of the climate threat. Yet this increased awareness has yet to translate into collective action by world leaders to mitigate climate change, let alone targeted efforts to protect the most vulnerable groups – beginning with women and girls. The facts speak for themselves. Women are likelier than men to live in poverty, and gendered social roles that reproduce socioeconomic power imbalances leave women and girls particularly vulnerable to a wide variety of climate consequences, including reduced access to water, food, shelter, and vital services. Not surprisingly, 80% of people displaced by climate change are women. Moreover, women are more likely than men to suffer from increased workload and income loss due to climate disasters. In South Sudan – one of the world’s fastest-warming countries – droughts and flooding have forced girls and women to walk farther to gather firewood and obtain water, a time-consuming and potentially dangerous change. As meeting households’ energy, water, and food needs becomes more difficult, girls are often taken out of school or married off at a young age. This exacerbates existing inequalities and entrenches these girls’ vulnerability. Women are also more likely to face climate-sensitive health consequences, such as undernutrition and malaria, and to die in natural disasters, such as droughts and floods. An Oxfam report found that in India, Indonesia, and Sri Lanka, surviving men outnumbered surviving women by almost three to one after the 2004 tsunami. During the 2015 earthquake in Nepal, many pregnant women were unable to reach health centers, increasing their risk of complications or even death. The World Health Organization reports that the effects of gender on life expectancy in natural disasters tend to be larger in more severe disasters, and where women’s socioeconomic status is lower. In other words, we cannot address the climate crisis without tackling the gender-equality crisis. Make no mistake: there is indeed a gender-equality crisis. Our partnership, Equal Measures 2030, recently launched the SDG Gender Index, which analyzes data on most of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals from 129 countries, representing 95% of the world’s girls and women. Based on indicators like vulnerability to climate change, health, economic opportunities, property rights, and gender-based violence, we calculated a score for each country. On a 100-point scale, the global average amounted to just 65.7 – barely a passing grade – with no country having fully achieved gender equality, as envisioned by SDG5. As for SDG13 – “take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts” – our research considered three topics. The first was overall climate vulnerability. This varies across countries and regions: in the Asia-Pacific region, for example, more than 100 million people are already affected by climate change each year. But no one is immune. On the second topic – the state’s commitment to disaster risk reduction – only 15 of 129 countries (11%) receive excellent scores. With the world facing a climate emergency, countries should be attempting to anticipate and prepare for disasters, with an eye to protecting the most vulnerable. The third topic – women’s representation in the political process relating to climate change – produced similarly disappointing results. Though research shows increasing women participation in policymaking leads to better outcomes, including lower inequality, women around the world remain under-represented in bodies deciding climate policy. What would it take for countries to make progress on the deeply interconnected SDG5 and SDG13? We offer seven recommendations. · To improve planning, create gender-disaggregated databases with information on marginalized and vulnerable communities. · Strengthen accountability by requiring governments to maintain open access to data. · Improve coordination among government ministries and other relevant bodies. · Pursue innovative, targeted initiatives, such as a new joint program of the Asian Pacific Resource and Research Centre for Women (ARROW) and the Danish Family Planning Association, which focuses on the intersection of climate vulnerability and sexual and reproductive health and rights. · Increase women’s representation in national and global decision-making bodies working on climate-related issues. · Develop solutions that reflect the perspectives of women affected by climate change. · Commit to – and follow through on – more ambitious action on climate change and gender equality, beginning at this month’s UN climate summit. When dealing with complex challenges, it can be tempting to establish false tradeoffs, with leaders claiming that they must choose between action in two areas. But SDG13 cannot be achieved without progress on SDG5, and we can’t wait to achieve SDG5 before we take action on SDG13. This applies to the entire SDG agenda: if countries attempt to pursue individual goals in isolation, they will fail to achieve any of them. Ambitious, coordinated, and holistic strategies are desperately needed.",
            "以妇女为中心的气候日程 伦敦—从少女活动家格丽塔·塔恩伯格（Greta Thunberg）广受关注的乘坐零排放船横穿大西洋出席联合国大会之旅，到各种气候示威频发，世界比以往任何时候都更加明白其后威胁。 但这一日益清醒的局面还没有促使世界领导人采取减轻气候变化的动作，更不用说为最脆弱群体 — — 首先便是妇女和女童 — — 采取专门措施了。 事实证明一切。 妇女比男性更有可能陷入贫困，导致社会经济权力不平衡的男女有别的社会角色让妇女和女童特别容易受到各种气候后果的影响，包括水、粮食、住所和基本服务的普及。 毫不奇怪，80%的因气候变化而流离失所的人是妇女。 此外，妇女比男性更有可能遭到因气候灾难导致的工作量增加和收入减少。 在南苏丹 — — 全世界变暖最快的国家之一 — — 干旱和洪水迫使女童和妇女走更远的路收集柴火和水源，这一变化带来了时间的增加和潜在的危险。 由于满足家庭能源、水和粮食需求变得更加困难，女童常常被迫辍学，早早结婚。 这加剧了现有不平等水平，也让女童弱势固化。 妇女也更容易面临气候敏感性健康后果，如营养不良和疟疾；更容易死于自然灾害，如干旱和洪水。 一份牛津大学报告发现，在印度、印尼和斯里兰卡，2004年海啸后幸存的男性数量几乎是女性的三倍。 2015年尼泊尔地震期间，许多孕妇无法抵达诊所，这增加了并发症甚至死亡的风险。 世界卫生组织报告，性别对自然灾害中的生命预期的影响会随着灾难严重性的增加而提高，随着妇女社会经济地位的下降而提高。 换句话说，不解决性别不平等危机，就无法解决气候危机。 不要搞错了：确实存在性别平等危机。 我们的合作计划，平等措施2030（Equal Measures 2030）最近发布了SDG性别知数，分析了来自129个国家的17个可持续发展目标（SDG）的相关数据，可以代表全世界95%的女童和妇女。 基于面对气候变化的脆弱性、健康、经济机会、财产权利和基于性别的暴力等指标，我们为每个国家计算了分数。 用百分制衡量，全球平均分只有66.7 — — 刚刚及格 — — 没有一个国家完全实现了SDG5所构想的性别平等。 至于SDG13 — — “采取紧急行动遏制气候变化及其影响 ” ， 我们的研究考虑了三个问题。 首先是总体气候脆弱性。 这会因国家和地区而异：比如，亚太地区每年已有一亿多人受到气候变化影响。 但没人可以幸免。 对于第二个问题 — — 国家对降低灾难风险的承诺，129个国家中只有15个（11 % ） 能达到优秀分数。 世界正面临着气候紧急情况，各国应该尝试预测灾难并未雨绸缪，着眼于保护最脆弱群体。 第三个问题 — — 妇女在气候变化相关政治日程中的代表问题 — — 结果同样令人失望。 尽管研究表明，增加妇女的决策参与度能带来更好的结果，包括更低的不平等性，但全球妇女在制定气候政策的机构中仍然代表不足。 各国应该采取怎样的措施在高度相关的SDG5和SDG13上实现进步？ 我们提供了七条建议。 · 改善规划，建立分性别的数据库，收集边缘化和脆弱群体的信息。 · 加强问责，要求政府保持数据开放。 · 改善政府部门和其他相关机构之间的协调。 · 采取创新性、定向性措施，如亚太妇女资源与研究中心（ARROW）和丹麦计划生育协会（Danish Family Planning Association）的一项新的联合计划着眼于其后脆弱性和性和生殖健康和权利的交叉。 · 提高妇女在其后相关问题的国家和全球决策机构的代表性。 · 制定体现受气候影响的妇女的角度的方案。 · 承诺并兑现更加宏大的气候变化和性别平等行动，从这个月的联合国气候峰会开始。 在面临复杂挑战时，很容易陷入错误的权衡，领导人声称他们必须在两个方面的行动中做出选择。 但如果SDG5不能取得进展，SDG13也无法实现，而我们不能坐等SDG5完成后再开始SDG13的工作。 这也适用于整个SDG日程：如果各国孤立地追求个别目标，就无法实现任何目标。 我们急需宏大、协作、整体的战略。"

            "The Next Stage of Women’s Emancipation? LONDON – February 6, 2018, marked the centenary of the Representation of the People Act, which enfranchised (some) women in Britain for the first time – a reward for women’s work during World War I. In honor of this historic event, statues of two leaders in the struggle for women’s suffrage, Millicent Fawcett and Emmeline Pankhurst, are to be erected in British cities. The economic emancipation of women had to wait till after World War II, when permanent male labor shortages – the result, incidentally, of Keynesian full-employment policies – pulled ever more women out of domesticity and into factories and shops. This second wave of emancipation concentrated on economic inequalities, especially discrimination in job selection and disparities in pay and property rights. These battles have also mainly been won. Discrimination in inheritance is long gone, and equal pay for equal work is accepted in theory, though a gender bias persists (as it does for selection to senior posts). For example, Carrie Gracie recently resigned as the BBC’s China editor in protest against unequal pay between male and female editors, shaming six top male employees to agree to substantial wage cuts. It is only a matter of time – of overcoming habit, prejudice, and inertia – before what is accepted in principle becomes practice. The most interesting remaining argument for unequal treatment relates to activities for which there is a premium on physical qualities, as in sport. In traditional societies, men did the fighting, because they were stronger, faster, and taller. Not surprisingly, one of the last remaining bastions of unequal pay today is in competitive sport, which is a ritualized form of warfare. In most major sports, there are separate men’s and women’s teams and events, with lower standards of performance expected of women. For example, men’s tennis matches often comprise up to five sets, compared to three for women. The best men can beat the best women because they are stronger, hit the ball harder, and have more stamina. In swimming, the longest race for men is 1,500 meters, while for women it is 800 meters. One sport in which women compete equally with men is equestrianism – not just racing, but also dressage, show jumping, and three-day eventing. The question is whether pay ought to be equal in an area in which performance is unequal “by nature.” In tennis, the principle of equal pay for unequal performance is accepted for grand slam events, but not for many others. Elsewhere, the gender pay gap remains striking, notably in football (soccer). The captain of England’s professional women’s team, Steph Houghton, is paid just £65,000 ($90,000) a year, whereas Neymar, the world’s most expensive male player, receives roughly 500 times as much. And while players in England’s women’s super league earn an annual wage of up to £35,000, Chelsea’s male players are paid, on average, a staggering £4.5 million. One argument frequently made for equalizing pay is that sportswomen put in as much effort as sportsmen to produce their results. This harks back to the old labor theory of value, which contended that all value was created by work. But the link between hours of work and market prices is almost non-existent in practice, which is why economists needed a different explanation for market prices. Economists today say that prices (including wages and salaries) are determined by consumer demand. What a thing costs depends not on the amount of time and effort spent producing it, but on what it is worth to the buyer. Male footballers are paid more than female players because their services are more in demand. If women’s football teams started paying their players the same as men’s teams, they would go bankrupt. Unemployment is the price of insisting on being paid above the “market-clearing” level. Market prices, economists insist, do not measure moral worth but market worth. If we want market-determined rewards to equate with “just” rewards, we either have to abolish markets – the socialist solution – or restructure individual preferences. One argument is that women in sport would command the same market price as men, if only structural gender biases, such as greater media coverage and sponsorship for men’s sports, were removed. Although market value may be determined by consumer demand, as economic theory has it, these preferences are themselves the result of socially structured gender biases. In the absence of these biases, demand for women’s sports – as measured by attendance at matches, television ratings, and so on – would equal demand for men’s sports. This argument is based on the assumption – which extends far beyond sports – that real gender equality will not be achieved until the formation of tastes and habits is no longer subject to gender stereotypes. Boys would not automatically be given toy guns, while girls are given dolls. This sounds reasonable enough, until one recognizes the lengths to which radical feminists are willing to go to re-engineer tastes and preferences. Language is being systematically purged of “gender bias.” University courses in humanities and social sciences are being subjected to implicit or explicit forms of gender censorship. Gender itself is increasingly seen as “socially constructed”; and children, therefore, should be encouraged to choose their own gender. To me, the latest offensive against men is a good cause gone mad. But then, as a 78-year-old white male, I would think that, wouldn’t I?",
            "妇女解放的新阶段？ 该法案首次授予（部分）英国妇女选举权 — — 以表彰妇女在第一次世界大战期间做出的贡献。 为了铭记这一历史性事件，英国许多城市都为两位妇女参政权斗争的领导者 — — 米莉森特·福西特（Millicent Fawcett）和艾米琳·潘克斯特（Emmeline Pankhurst）树立了雕像。 妇女的经济解放则要等到第二次世界大战之后，男性劳动力的长期短缺 — — 凯恩斯主义充分就业政策的偶然结果 — — 促使更多妇女走出家门，走入工厂和商店。 这一第二次解放潮集中在经济不平等上，特别是就业选择歧视和薪酬和财产权利不公。 这些斗争也大体赢得了胜利。 继承歧视早已不复存在，同工同酬也在理论上被接受，尽管性别偏见依然顽固（比如在高层岗位的遴选上 ） 。 比如，凯利·格雷西（Carrie Gracie）最近因为抗议男女编辑薪酬不平等而辞去BBC中国编辑一职，让六位高层男员工感到无地自容，被迫同意大幅减薪。 从原则上被接受到转化为实践只是时间问题 — — 需要克服习惯、偏见和惯性。 对于待遇不平等问题，现有的最有趣的论点指出在一些活动存在身体条件溢价，比方说体育。 在传统社会中，男性负责战斗，因为他们更强壮、速度更快、个子更高。 毫不奇怪，当今薪酬不平等的最后几个堡垒之一便是竞技体育，即仪式化的战斗。 大部分体育项目分男女团队和赛事，对女子比赛的标准和预期表现都较低。 比如，男子网球比赛通常为五盘三胜，而女子为三盘两胜。 最佳男选手能够击败最佳女选手，因为前者更强壮，击球力量更大，耐力更好。 在游泳比赛中，男子距离最长项目是1,500米，女子是800米。 女子与男子平等竞技的项目是马术 — — 不仅仅包括赛马，也包括盛装舞步、场地障碍赛和三日赛。 问题在于，在表现“天然”不平等的领域，是否应该薪酬平等。 在网球界，大满贯赛事接受了表现不同但薪酬相同的原则，但许多其他赛事并非如此。 在其他项目上，性别薪酬差距巨大，特别是足球。 英格兰职业女子足球队长史蒂夫·霍顿（Steph Houghton）年薪只有65,000英镑，而最昂贵的男子选手内马尔（Neymar）年薪是这一数字的500倍。 英格兰女足超级联赛球员年薪不超过35,000英镑，而切尔西男足选手平均粘性高达450万英镑。 要求薪酬平等化的一个常用论点是女运动员为了提升水平，付出了和男运动员一样多的努力。 这让人想起旧劳动价值论，即所有价值都由工作产生。 但工作时间和市场价格之间的联系在现实中几乎不存在，正因如此，经济学家需要对市场价格做出不同的解释。 今天，经济学家说价格（包括工资和薪酬）由消费需求决定。 一样东西需要多少钱不取决于生产它用了多少时间、耗费了多少努力，而取决于它对买家有什么价值。 男足球运动员薪酬比女足球运动员高，是因为他们的服务需求更高。 如果女足球队给队员和男足一样的薪酬，就会破产。 失业便是坚持支付高于“市场出清”水平的价格。 经济学家一直说，市场价格不衡量道德价值，只衡量市场价值。 如果我们想要市场决定的奖励等于“公平”奖励，就必须放弃市场 — — 这是社会主义的方案 — — 或者改变个人偏好。 一个观点是女运动员只有在结构性性别歧视 — — 比如男子项目能够获得更多的媒体覆盖和赞助 — — 被消除的情况下，才能要求和男运动员一样的市场价格。 尽管如经济学理论认为的那样，市场价值由消费需求决定，但这些偏好本身也是社会中的性别偏见的结果。 如果不存在这些偏见，对女子项目的需求 — — 用看台上座率、电视转播率等指标衡量 — — 就能和男子项目等量齐观。 这一观点基于一个假设 — — 这个假设可以在体育的基础上推而广之 — — 即真正的性别平等要等到品味和习惯的形成不再受到性别成见的影响时才能实现。 男孩不再自动被给予玩具枪，女孩不再被自动给予洋娃娃。 这看上起非常合理，但让我们看看极端女权主义者在重塑品味和偏好方面走得多远。 语言正在被系统性地清洗“性别偏见 ” 。 人文和社会科学大学课程需要受到直接或间接的性别审查。 性别本身被日益视为“社会产物 ” ； 因此，儿童应该被鼓励选择自己的性别。 对我来说，这一最新的仇男论是因为良好的初衷过犹不及。 但身为一名78岁的白人男性，我会想，我会吗？"

            "Empowering Africa’s Women Farmers WASHINGTON, DC – Over 60% of all employed women in Sub-Saharan Africa work in agriculture. Yet the region’s women farmers often reap a meager harvest, not because of inclement weather or poor soil quality, but because of their gender – or, more specifically, because of a dense web of laws, policies, programs, and customs that put them at a significant disadvantage. Closing the gender gap in agriculture will require action on three fronts. The first is land rights. In most of Sub-Saharan Africa, women rarely own land. Instead, women farmers usually access land through a male relative, most commonly a husband, brother, or father. This arrangement leaves them highly vulnerable; a death, divorce, or simply a man’s change of mind can leave a woman farmer landless overnight. The resulting insecurity affects the way women farm. At constant risk of displacement, long-term productivity-enhancing investments don’t make financial sense. Why build terraces to reduce erosion and improve soil health if someone else can claim the land and its improvements as soon as the work is finished? Why plant an orchard if it can simply be taken away once the final tree is in the ground? Over the last two decades, many countries have taken important steps to promote and protect women’s land rights. For example, Ethiopia introduced joint land registration – with the names and photographs of both husband and wife included on certificates – thereby formalizing women’s rights to the land they farm. Such reform has been shown to lead to increased investment in land, especially by women. The investment rises even higher among women who are also educated about their land rights, highlighting the importance of legal literacy programs. But land is only the first step. Women also lack equal access to inputs, including fertilizer, better seeds, mechanical equipment, and agricultural extension services that would connect them with information about improved agricultural practices. This inequality is compounded by unequal access to the credit farmers need to purchase inputs. In Kenya, Malawi, Sierra Leone, Zambia, and Zimbabwe, studies have shown that women are less likely to benefit from financial services. Improving access to financial services and agricultural inputs thus constitutes the second front for empowering women farmers. Development agencies and NGOs have begun working to design woman-focused financial services and programs to improve access to agricultural inputs. African women are also helping one another, with a growing number of women’s organizations, such as microfinance groups, working to improve access to financial services, new technologies, and information. In Kenya, members of such self-help groups are likelier than other women to know about climate-smart agricultural practices, for example. The final front is perhaps the trickiest: decision-making power. In far too many contexts, women farmers lack the authority to manage the crops they produce or the income they generate. This has far-reaching implications for development. In Sub-Saharan Africa, agriculture is 2-4 times more effective in reducing poverty than growth in other sectors. Moreover, as the Goalkeepers report released last month by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation showed, women are likelier than men to invest resources under their control in meeting their children’s needs (food and education). Given this, enabling women farmers to control their resources is important to achieving not only United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 5 – gender equality and empowerment of women and girls – but also many others, including eliminating poverty (SDG1) and ending hunger (SDG2). Though some progress has been made on all three fronts to empower women farmers, it is nowhere near enough. To encourage and guide further action, my colleagues at the International Food Policy Research Institute and I designed the Women’s Empowerment in Agriculture Index, which measures decision-making power, access to resources (including credit), control over income, time burdens, and membership in groups. By providing insight into the extent and sources of women’s agricultural disempowerment in various contexts, the WEAI – and a later adaptation, pro-WEAI, which facilitates project impact assessments – is helping governments, donors, and NGOs to design effective interventions. So far, the WEAI (including adaptations) has been used by 99 different organizations in 54 countries. For example, WEAI insights guided the design of Bangladesh’s ANGeL project, which aims to identify actions and investments in agriculture that will improve nutrition and empower women. When Africa’s women farmers thrive, everyone benefits: the women themselves, the children in whom they invest, the communities that they feed, and the economies to which they contribute. With the right investments and policies, Africa’s woman-run farms could produce a bumper crop of development.",
            "赋权非洲女性农民 华盛顿—撒哈拉以南非洲超过60%的就业女性从事农业工作。 但该地区女性农民往往收获微薄，而且不是因为天气严酷或土壤质量恶劣，而是因为他们的女性身份 — — 或者，更确切的说，因为密集的法律、政策、项目和习俗网导致她们身处困境当中。 缩小两性农业差距需要在三方面采取行动。 首先是土地权。 在撒哈拉以南非洲的大部分地区，女性很少拥有土地。 恰恰相反，女性农民往往获取土地需要通过男性亲属，其中最常见的包括丈夫、兄弟或父亲。 这样的安排导致她们非常弱势；死亡、离异或仅仅是男性改变主意都可以让女性在一夜之间失去土地。 如此导致的不安全感影响了女性的耕作方式。 由于持续存在被取代的风险，提高生产率的长期投资并不具有财务意义。 为什么要修筑梯田来减少侵蚀和改善土壤健康状况，如果工程一完工就有人可以夺走土地？ 如果种完最后一棵树，果园可以被立刻夺走，那么种植果园还有什么意义？ 过去20年来，许多国家已经采取了重要步骤来推动和保护妇女的土地权利。 举例来讲，埃塞俄比亚引入了联合土地登记制 — — 即把夫妻双方的姓名和照片同时列入证书 — — 从而正式化妇女对其所耕种土地的权利。 上述改革已经被证明会增加对土地的投资，尤其是来自女性的投资。 在同时接受土地权教育的妇女中投资增长甚至更大，从而凸显了法制教育计划的重要意义。 但土地仅仅是第一步而已。 女性同时无法平等获取生产资料，包括化肥、良种、机械设备和能使她们了解如何改善农业操作技术的农业推广服务信息。 农民购买所需生产资料的信贷不平等加剧了目前的农业权利不平等。 在肯尼亚、马拉维、塞拉利昂、赞比亚和津巴布韦，研究表明女性不太可能从金融服务中受益。 改善金融服务和农业投入获取因此成为授权女性农民的第2种方式。 发展机构和非政府组织已经开始致力于设计以妇女为中心的金融服务和项目，以改善她们对农业生产资料的获取。 非洲女性也正在互相帮助，越来越多的女性机构，如小额信贷团体，致力于改善女性获取金融服务、新技术和信息。 例如在肯尼亚，上述自助团体成员相比其他女性更有可能了解对气候有益的农业耕作方式。 最后一个因素也许最为重要：那就是决策权。 在太多情况下，女性农民缺乏管理其所生产作物或者创造收入的权力。 这对发展会产生意义深远的影响。 在撒哈拉以南非洲，农业减贫效果相比其他行业增长高效2~4倍。 此外，正如比尔和梅林达·盖茨基金会上月公布的目标守卫者报告所指出的那样，相比男性，女性更有可能将其控制下的资源投资于满足其子女需求的目的（食品和教育 ） 。 有鉴于此，赋权女性农民控制资源不仅对实现联合国可持续发展目标第5条 — — 性别平等和赋权女性及女童 — — 至关重要，而且对许多其他目标，包括消除贫困（可持续发展目标第1条）和结束饥饿（可持续发展目标第2条）同样具有极为重要的意义。 尽管在授权女性农民的所有三个方面均取得了一定进展，但还有许多工作要做。 为鼓励和指导进一步行动，我和我在国际粮食政策研究所的同事一道设计了女性农业赋权指数，上述指数衡量决策权、资源获取权（包括信贷 ） 、 收入控制权、时间负担以及团体成员资质。 通过评估不同背景下剥夺女性农业权利的原因和严重程度，女性农业赋权指数（WEAI ） — —以及后来的改进版，有助于项目影响评估的专业女性农业赋权指数 — — 正在协助政府、捐助机构和非政府组织设计更为有效的干预措施。 截止目前为止，女性农业赋权指数已经在54个国家的99个不同机构中得到了运用。 例如，女性农业赋权指数指导设计了孟加拉国的天使项目（ANGeL ） ， 该项目旨在确定能够改善营养和女性授权的农业行动和投资。 如果非洲女性农民能够逐渐富裕，每个人都会从中受益：其中包括妇女本身、她们所投资的儿童，她们所供养的群体以及她们为之贡献的经济。 如果给予恰当的投资和政策，非洲女性所经营的农场可以在发展领域获得大丰收。"

            "Women for Integration COPENHAGEN – The past decade has proven again and again that empowering women worldwide holds the key to solving many seemingly intractable issues that have otherwise stymied policymakers. Poverty in the developing world seemed ineradicable until micro-lenders saw millions of low-income, destitute women as potential entrepreneurs. Involving African women in decision-making about crop production turns out to enable environmentally sustainable farming practices. Runaway population growth becomes controllable when women have access to literacy and business opportunities as well as to contraception. Could the tensions and conflicts surrounding the issue of immigration in Europe be yet another issue for which the empowerment of women holds a solution? In a recent visit to Copenhagen to commemorate International Women’s Day, I took part in many conversations that duplicate others throughout Europe: citizens from across the political spectrum were struggling with the issue of non-European immigration and the cultural tensions that have ensued. What does it mean to be Danish, German, or French in the presence of these millions of newcomers, most of whom come from non-democratic societies? Some of this anxiety is pure racism; but some is not. What would “integration” mean, and how is it achieved without the loss of cherished civil-society values? These are not necessarily xenophobic questions: a post-enlightenment civil society, with a free press and due process, is a precious thing, and those values should not be sacrificed to politically correct moral relativism. This issue has been given new urgency by the arrests in Ireland of alleged jihadists from several countries who are accused of plotting to murder a Swedish cartoonist who drew an image of the prophet Mohammed as a dog. Across Europe, the discussions are growing more intense as anti-immigration platforms gain supporters in otherwise liberal countries, from Germany to France to traditionally inclusive and tolerant Denmark itself. Then I witnessed the prototype of a true solution. I met Elisabeth Møller Jensen, the director of KVINFO, “the Danish center for information on gender, equality and ethnicity” – an extraordinary organization funded by Denmark’s Ministry of Culture. One of its many innovative programs is already showing results in terms of genuinely integrating immigrant families into Danish society. By addressing immigrant women – and by viewing them as potential leaders, rather than as quiescent potential maids or service workers – KVINFO is enabling their families to witness the benefits of an open civil society in their own lives. KVINFO began a “mentor network” aimed at immigrant and refugee women in 2002. By 2010, it had 5,000 participants, had won awards and international acclaim for best integrative practices, and is being replicated throughout Denmark – and observers are exploring programs or partnerships modeled upon it in Canada, Spain, Portugal, and Norway. The program pairs refugee and immigrant women in a one-to-one mentoring relationship with women who are established leaders at all levels of Danish society. The pairing is not cursory. A careful matchmaking process unites the interests and goals of the women on both sides, and already has paid amazing dividends. Women who were journalists, engineers, or scientists in their countries of origin – and who could not get jobs as checkout cashiers in Denmark – have been paired with Danish counterparts and are now back in school, or working in research. But even women who arrive with no higher education or professional skills create an “action plan.” They learn from their mentors what options there are, how to proceed, and what to do to reach their objectives. As they enter the workforce, their language skills improve, their household income soars, and their children see firsthand a woman in a respected, economically valued role. Their loved ones thus learn how to thrive in a European context – occasionally coming to KVINFO events and benefiting from their mothers’ expanding network of contacts. So, rather than feeling exploited and condemned indefinitely to the fringes of a Northern European society – and thus vulnerable to the stirrings of demagogues and extremists – these women’s children grow up fully familiar with Danish civil society, well informed about higher education and professional opportunities, and hopeful rather than cynical. By empowering women, the whole family is lifted up and, in a supportive rather than a colonizing way, “Europeanized” in the best sense. I am often struck by the way many Europeans use arms-length euphemisms when talking about immigrants: they want immigrants to feel “welcome” or “comfortable.” I always wonder, “But do you want them to feel French, or German, or Norwegian?” To be fully integrated, Muslim and other newcomers to European countries must be welcomed not as perpetual visitors – even if, ideally, as nicely treated visitors – but rather as family members, as the American model does (or aspires to do). As Møller Jensen put it, “I want these children to feel Danish .” These young people and Denmark itself will benefit, as this “KVINFO generation” grows up with a genuine stake in Danish civil society, and seeing the world as Danes, not as guests.",
            "妇女的融合作用 发自哥本哈根 — — 在过去十几年中，事实已经不断地证明全世界那些被赋予权力的女性可以令那些困扰政策制定者的棘手难题迎刃而解：发展中国家的贫困问题看似无法根治，直到小额贷款者将数百万低收入的贫苦女性视为潜在的创业者就有了转机。 而将非洲女性纳入到农业政策制定过程中的举措则令到农业的环境可持续发展成为现实。 原本失控的人口增长率在妇女得到受教育权和经商权，以及学会避孕之后也变得有章法了。 那么围绕着欧洲移民问题所造成一系列紧张和冲突局面是否也能通过这些被赋予权力的女性来解决呢？ 最近在赴哥本哈根庆祝国际妇女节的时候，我参加了许多场跟欧洲其他地方一模一样的对话：所有欧洲人，不管持有不同政治立场的，都纠缠于非欧洲移民以及随之而来的文化冲突问题。 许多丹麦人，德国人和法国人根本不明白这数百万新移民究竟意味着什么，更何况其中绝大多数移民甚至来自于非民主国家！ 其中有些担忧纯粹是民族主义的；有些则不是。 “融合”这个词究竟该如何解读，又该如何在不伤及市民社会价值理念的情况下达致融合？ 这可不仅仅是排不排外的问题：一个拥有新闻自由和法定程序的，后文明时代的市民社会是非常宝贵的财富，而这些价值观不应该被那些官员们只顾政治正确的道德相对主义而遭到抹杀。 在爱尔兰逮捕了多位试图谋杀一名将先知默罕默德描绘成一条狗的瑞典卡通画家的所谓圣战者之后，这个问题变得更加紧迫了。 有关这个问题的讨论在全欧洲都日趋激烈，反移民政党在其他自由主义国家都获得了更多的支持，从德国，法国，一直到传统上比较平等包容的丹麦。 但随后我看见了一个真正解决方案的雏形。 我碰到了丹麦性别，平等和种族信息中心的主管伊丽莎白·穆勒·詹森，她所在的是个受丹麦文化部资助而且非同寻常的机构。 而该中心的其中一个创新性项目则已经在移民家庭真正融入丹麦社会方面取得了成果。 通过把女性移民视为潜在的领导者 — — 而不是沉默的候补保姆和服务员 — — 中心使得她们的家庭可以亲身见证一个开放社会所带来的好处。 在2002年，中心启动了一个专门针对女性移民和难民的“顾问网络 ” 。 时至今日，这个网络已经有5000名参与者，并在融合实践中赢得了奖项和国际声誉，并在丹麦全国推广 — — 而参观过这个项目的人又将其模式复制到加拿大，西班牙，葡萄牙和挪威。 而这个项目的做法就是让女性移民和难民和丹麦社会中的各级女性领袖结成“一对一”的顾问关系。 这个配对可不是随便安排的。 一个精心设计的配对程序将双方的兴趣和目标结合起来，并结出了丰硕的成果。 那些在原住国身为记者，工程师和科学家，却在丹麦连个超市收银员都当不上的妇女和丹麦当地的女性同行结成一对，得以回到学校或者投身研究工作之中。 而那些没有高学历或者专业技术的女性也制定了一个“行动方案 ” 。 她们从自己的结对顾问那里学到了如何选择，如何运作以及如何行动去实现自身目标。 随着她们投入到工作当中，她们的语言能力得到提高，家庭收入增加，而她们的孩子则亲眼看到了一个有尊严，有经济能力的女性。 孩子们也因此学到如何在欧洲的文化背景下取得成功 — — 偶尔还能来参加中心的活动并从母亲不断扩大的社会联系网中获益。 因此，这些妇女的后代就不会在一个北欧国家的社会边缘中感到无尽的剥夺和不幸，并因此易于受到煽动者和极端分子的蛊惑，而是在对丹麦市民社会的充分理解中成长，被赋予更高的教育水平和职业机会，对生活充满希望而不是愤世嫉俗。 通过这些被赋予权力的妇女，整个家庭都通过一个支持性而不是殖民式的方式得到提升，用最好的方式实现了“欧洲化 ” 。 我常常惊讶于许多欧洲人在谈论移民时喜欢用一些特别冗长委婉的词汇：他们希望移民能感觉到“受欢迎”和“舒适 ” ， 我一直在想：你为什么不让他们感觉特法国，特德国，或者特挪威呢？ 为了实现完全融合，穆斯林和其他欧洲各国的新移民不应被被视为“永久性访客 ” （ 甚至理想化地视为受到良好照顾的访客 ） ， 而应该像美国模式（或努力追求的）那样被视为家庭的真正成员。 正如穆勒·詹森所说 ： “ 我希望这些孩子都觉得特丹麦 ” 。 随着“中心一代”在一个纯正丹麦市民社会的基础上成长，并以丹麦人而不是外来人的视角来看待这个世界，获益的将不不止是他们自己，还有这个国家。"

            "The War on Talent WASHINGTON, DC – In the 1950s, during a very tight postwar labor market, American business executives voted Human Resources (HR) the most glamorous area in business. As Wharton School professor Peter Cappelli recounts, “90% of positions (and virtually all those in the top ranks) were filled from within – and 96% of large companies dedicated an entire department to planning for workforce needs.” When companies need talent, he argues, the prestige of HR goes up; when labor markets go slack, HR returns to benefits administration. The labor market is very tight today, with unemployment rates in the United States at or below 4% since March 2018. In their popular 2018 book Talent Wins, former McKinsey global managing director Dominic Barton and his coauthors urge every aspiring CEO to gain serious HR experience and every corporate board to spend significant time on talent issues. Likewise, Ellie Filler of the consulting firm Korn Ferry and Dave Ulrich of the University of Michigan have found that CEOs’ relevant traits are more closely matched with those of Chief Human Resources Officers (CHROs) than with those of any other C-Suite position. CHROs, they suggest, should be considered when selecting CEOs. This war for talent should be great news for women, because women dominate HR. In the US, there is also a much higher percentage of women of color in HR than in any other corporate department. Overall, despite advances, women still account for only about 10% of top executive positions in US corporations. Only 4% of C-Suite leaders are women of color. In HR, by contrast, women are actually in the majority: 73% of HR managers, and 55% of CHROs. Roughly one-third of US HR professionals identify as non-white, and more than 10% of Fortune 100 CHROs are women of color. So we have our solution to the women’s leadership gap, right? Not so fast. The groundbreaking McKinsey study that predicted talent would be the most valuable corporate resource – and in short supply – was published more than 20 years ago. Growing appreciation for the value of talent has not been matched by growing appreciation for the value of HR. Despite efforts at rebranding (as “People,” “Employee Experience,” or simply “Talent”), HR’s reputation as a functional backwater persists. CHROs may have a seat at the table, but that seat’s occupant is still least likely to become CEO. Moreover, HR leaders are paid far less than their C-Suite peers, indicating that they are valued far less. According to the Chief Executive Group, CHROs at public companies earn less than 10% of what their C-level counterparts earn. In short, human capital is highly valued, but the people in charge of human resources are not. One likely reason is that HR professionals are viewed as lacking business acumen. There is some merit to this perception. A historical focus on functions like employee relations and benefits administration has left HR with a reputation for straddling the line between risk-averse and mundane, hardly the function you’d want to lead innovative and forward-looking efforts that might determine the fate of the business. And relatively low pay has made it harder for HR – a rare path for graduates of top business schools – to attract top talent. HR is also the functional embodiment of “office housework.” It is a discipline that has been asked to manage the lion’s share of hard-to-measure administrative tasks that advance the business but not the careers of those who perform them. It’s not surprising, then, that CEOs are only too happy to increase diversity (marginally) by hiring women, including a large number of women of color, for the housework job, one that requires lots of focus on messy relationships among employees. And, like all other professions dominated by women, it is then paid less and valued less. Under-resourced and inundated with transactional work, HR leaders have historically struggled to perform the strategic work now demanded of them. The good news is that HR’s role is changing. For starters, it is much more quantitative. People analytics, popularized by former Google executive Laszlo Bock, is now an established tool, and HR departments routinely hire data scientists to inform critical business decisions. In addition, the HR tech field has exploded, creating an ecosystem of more than 4,000 software providers catering to HR professionals. This evolution, along with a trend toward outsourcing benefits administration, is fundamentally reshaping the HR function. But when more technology and data are involved, requiring more quantitative skills, CEOs turn to men. Instead of tapping into the talent pool of women in HR, business leaders are tilting toward hiring “strategic” HR executives from non-HR backgrounds. Job descriptions for HR leadership roles increasingly cite “business acumen” as a necessary prerequisite. Other companies have responded to a perceived talent gap in the HR field by taking pieces of the function and distributing them to other, male-dominated functions: payroll and benefits to the CFO, analytics to the CTO, software systems to the CIO, and so on. Bringing fresh talent into the HR field and increasing cross-functional involvement in and support for HR is not all bad. It could mean more resources devoted to HR, more attention paid to what HR leaders actually do, and more competition for top HR roles. But it could also mean that we squander an opportunity to recognize the talent that already exists among HR leaders who have been systematically undervalued, and to empower and upskill the existing HR talent pool. Last August, the US Business Roundtable announced its members’ intention to pursue “an economy that serves all Americans.” Central to that vision is an investment in fostering diverse and inclusive workforces. As talent takes center stage, and as stakeholder capitalism gains momentum, women in HR, the most diverse function in corporate America, are poised to rise. It is up to their bosses to let them.",
            "人才战争 华盛顿—20世纪50年代，在战后劳动力市场异常紧张的时候，美国企业高管认定人力资源（HR）是最有魅力的商业领域。 沃顿商学院教授彼得·卡佩利（Peter Cappelli）说 ： “ 90%的职位（以及几乎所有最高管理者）为内部人员充任 — — 96%的大公司都有一整个部门规划劳动力需求 。 ” 当公司需要人才时，卡佩利指出，HR的地位就上升；当劳动力市场趋于松弛时，HR便回归福利部门。 今天的劳动力市场也异常紧张，2018年3月以来，美国失业率一直位于4%或以下。 在2018年的畅销书《人才制胜 》 （ Talent Wins）中，麦肯锡公司前全球董事总经理多米尼克·巴顿（Dominic Barton）和他的合著者敦促所有有野心的首席执行官都要有高级HR经验，所有公司的董事会都要花大力气解决人才问题。 类似地，Korn Ferry咨询公司的艾利·费勒（Ellie Filler）和密歇根大学的戴夫·乌尔里奇（Dave Ulrich）发现，首席执行官的重要特征与首席人力资源官（CHRO）比其他任何“首席”职位都要紧密。 他们认为，在遴选首席执行官时应该考虑CHRO。 这一人才战争对于妇女来说应该是好消息，因为HR由妇女主导。 在美国，HR领域的有色人种妇女比例远高于其他公司部门。 总体而言，尽管取得了一些进步，但妇女仍只占美国公司部门最高管理职位的10 % 。 只有4% 的首席级领导人是有色人种妇女。 相反，在HR领域，妇女真正占据多数：73%的HR经理以及55%的CHRO。 大约三分之一的美国HR专业人士为非白人，10%以上的《财富》100强CHRO为有色人种妇女。 因此，我们已经有了妇女领导力缺口的解决方案，对吗？ 没有这么快。 预测人才将是最宝贵的公司资源 — — 并且供给不足 — — 的开创性麦肯锡研究发表于20多年前。 对人才的价值的认识的提高并没有带来对HR的价值的认识的提高。 尽管有了各种不同的名称（比如“人事 ” 、 “员工体验”或直称“人才 ” ） ，但HR仍然只是一个死水般的职能部门。 CHRO也许能够在决策层有一席之地，但坐在这个位子上的人成为首席执行官的可能性最低。 此外，HR领导人的薪酬也远低于其他首席职位，这表明公司对他们的估值不高。 据首席执行官集团（Chief Executive Group）数据，上市公司的CHRO要比其他首席职位薪酬低90%以上。 简言之，人力资本价值很高，但负责人力资源的人价值不高。 一个可能的原因是HR专业人士被认为缺乏商业头脑。 这样的感觉不无道理历史上，HR专注于员工关系和福利管理等功能，这让HR既厌恶风险又“市侩 ” ， 绝非引领能决定企业命运的创新和前瞻性举措的人选。 而相对较低的薪酬也让HR难以吸引顶尖人才，顶级商学院毕业生很少从事这项工作。 HR也是“职场家务事”的化身。 这门学科被要求管理大部分难以衡量的行政工作，这些工作推动了企业，却难以推动完成工作之人的事业。 因此，首席执行官们非常乐于通过雇用妇女，包括大量有色人种妇女从事“家务事 ” ， 即那些需要大量关注员工之间的琐碎关系的工作，并（在边际上）提高多样性，也就不足为奇了。 HR领导人缺少资源，又杂务缠身，在历史上很难完成现在要求他们完成的战略性工作。 好消息是，HR的角色正在发生改变。 首先，它变得更加量化了。 谷歌前高管拉斯洛·博克（Laszlo Bock）所推广的人事分析现在已成为成熟的工具，HR部门通常也会聘用数据科学家为重要业务决策提供信息。 此外，HR技术领域全面开花，创造了一个4,000多家软件供应商为HR专业人士服务的生态系统。 这一变化，再加上福利管理外包的趋势，正在从根本上改变HR功能。 但是，随着科技和数据的介入，HR工作需要更多的量化技能，首席执行官们开始转向男性。 企业领导人不去挖掘女HR人才库，而是更倾向于 雇用非HR背景的“战略性”HR高管。 HR领导层的岗位描述越来越多地将“商业头脑”作为必须要求。 其他公司感到HR的人才缺口，反应是将其一部分功能抽离分配个其他男性主导的部门：工资和福利分配给首席财务官，分析分配给首席技术官，软件系统分配给首席信息官，如此等等。 向HR领域引进新鲜人才，并提高跨部门参与和HR支持并非都是坏事。 这意味着更多资源用于HR，更多注意力关注HR领导人真正在做什么，以及更多人竞争顶层HR岗位。 但这也可能意味着我们拜拜浪费从现有HR领导人中间挖掘人才（这些人的价值被系统性地低估 ） ， 以及赋能和升级现有HR人才库的机会。 去年8月，美国商业圆桌（Business Roundtable）说其成员准备追求“一个服务于全体美国人民的经济 。 ” 该愿景的核心便是投资打造多样化的、包容的劳动力大军。 随着人才登上中心舞台，随着相关利益方资本主义动能已成，美国公司界多样性程度最高的部门 — — HR妇女必定会崛起。 就看她们的老板们让不让她们崛起了。"

            "Arab Women’s Unfinished Revolution FEZ – Though women across the Middle East participated actively in the Arab Spring protests that began in late 2010, they remain second-class citizens, even where popular uprisings managed to topple autocratic regimes. Indeed, the Islamist governments now in power in several countries seem more determined than the despots that they replaced to keep women out of politics. In conducting interviews with women in the region, I am struck by their overall pessimism. They fear the loss of their rights. They see economic disintegration all around them, raising the possibility of a further increase in violence. As social bonds fray, they feel increasingly vulnerable. More than once, I heard them express the view that things were better before the revolutions. Female representation in parliaments and government cabinets after the Arab Spring has been either absent or meager, and women activists worry that Islamist parties will implement reactionary policies that discriminate on the basis of gender. In Egypt, for example, the Freedom and Justice Party, which dominates the parliament, claims that a woman cannot become President. Egyptian women were heavily represented in the protests that brought down former President Hosni Mubarak’s regime in 2011, but they have been largely excluded from any official decision-making role ever since. In Morocco, while there were eightwomen in the previous cabinet, today there is only one in the Islamist-led government. In January, the Islamist-dominated parliament adopted a decree lowering the age of marriage for girls from 18 to 16, a major setback. Moroccan feminists have protested vigorously, but to no avail. Parliamentary representation for women has also taken a hit. Women hold less than 1% of seats in the current Egyptian parliament; previously, they held 12%. In Libya, a first draft of the electoral law reserved 10% of seats in the constituent assembly for women, but the quota was later abandoned. In Tunisia, the election in 2011 brought 49 women into the 217-seat Constituent Assembly. But 42 of these women are members of Ennahda, which regards Sharia (Islamic law) as the source of legislation. Long-time Tunisian activists fear that Ennahda, which dominates the assembly, will use the presence of women MPs to restrict women’s rights. The recent assassination of the secular Tunisian opposition leader Chokri Belaid has raised the stakes for women there. Belaid was a voice on behalf of women’s rights, and the threat of increased political violence will focus on those who advocate secular equality for all Tunisians, including women. Unfortunately, conservative forces in the Arab world repeatedly turn against women when political unrest spreads. In Bahrain, several women protesters have been arrested and tortured. In Yemen, the authorities call on male relatives to “tame” their women. In Tunisia, the most Westernized of the Arab countries, women have been attacked at universities and schools, and are being forced to wear the hijab. A woman who was allegedly raped by two policemen in September 2012 was charged with public indecency when she filed a complaint. Likewise, in Egypt, women protesters face greater scrutiny than men. Those arrested by the military during the anti-Mubarak protests were subjected to virginity tests as a form of intimidation. Across the Middle East, Islamist militias have harassed, arrested, raped, and tortured women pro-democracy activists. The model of Iran’s Islamic Revolution in 1979, which imposed second-class citizenship on women, is frequently cited as a threat in Arab countries now ruled by Islamist parties. These countries are at a crossroads. Women make up half of the Middle East’s population, and any hope of political and economic development must account for that fact. Organizations like the United Nations Development Program have repeatedly issued reports demonstrating the connection between economic decline and oppression of women. Simply put, the Arab countries will not succeed unless women are fully integrated into political and economic life. In her Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech in 2011, Yemeni political activist Tawakkol Karman, made the point clearly: “The solution to women’s issues can only be achieved in a free and democratic society in which human energy is liberated, the energy of both women and men together.” Middle Eastern countries should protect and consolidate women’s rights as a way to reinforce democratic ideas and habits. They must institute the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international laws and agreements in order to eradicate gender-based discrimination and violence. The hope for women’s progress is really a hope for a decent society in which development for all is possible.",
            "阿拉伯妇女未竟的革命 费斯—尽管中东地区的妇女积极地参与了2010年末开始的阿拉伯之春起义，但她们仍是二等公民，即便在群众起义推翻了独裁统治的地方也是如此。 事实上，如今，不少国家掌权的伊斯兰政府比被他们取代的暴君更热衷于将妇女排挤在政坛之外。 在采访该地区妇女的过程中，我被她们的悲观情绪深深地震惊了。 她们担心丧失权利。 她们认为经济崩溃随处可见，这让暴力进一步升级的可能性大大增加。 随着社会契约的腐蚀，她们感到越来越无助。 我不止一次听她们表示目前的状况还不如革命之前。 阿拉伯之春后，国会和政府内阁中的女性代表要么不存在，要么无足轻重，妇女活动家担心伊斯兰政党会采取性别歧视的反动政策。 比如，在埃及，占据议会多数的自由公正党（Freedom and Justice Party）宣布不能由女性出任总统。 在2011年推翻前总统穆巴拉克的起义中，妇女居功至伟，但在此后的所有决策过程中都鲜有女性身影出现。 在摩洛哥，上任内阁中有八名妇女，而在今天的伊斯兰政府中只剩下一名。 1月，伊斯兰教徒占多数的议会采纳了一项法令，将女孩适婚年龄从18岁降至16岁，这是一次大倒退。 摩洛哥女性强烈抗议，但完全无用。 议会中的妇女代表也遭受了打击。 目前埃及议会的妇女代表数量不到1 % ； 此前曾达到过12 % 。 在利比亚，选举法第一草案为妇女保留了10%的制宪大会议席，但这一配额后来被取消了。 在突尼斯，2011年的选举将49名妇女选入了217人的制宪大会。 但其中42人是复兴运动党（Ennahda）成员，该党认为伊斯兰教法才是合法性的源泉。 突尼斯的长期活动家担心在制宪大会占多数的社会运动党将利用妇女议员阻挠妇女权利。 最近发生的行刺突尼斯世俗反对派领袖贝莱德（Chokri Belaid）事件让人担心该国妇女的命运。 贝莱德是妇女权利的拥护者，政治暴力抬头的威胁将集中在支持所有突尼斯人（包括妇女在内）世俗平等的人头上。 不幸的是，在政治动荡蔓延时，阿拉伯世界的保守势力一再反对妇女。 在巴林，不少妇女示威者被逮捕并遭受严刑拷打。 在也门，当局要求男性亲属“管教好”家中的女人。 在最西方化的阿拉伯国家突尼斯，大学和学校中的女性频频遭袭，并被迫戴上面纱。 一名据称于2012年9月被两名警察强奸的妇女在提起申诉时被指公开猥亵。 类似地，在埃及，女性示威者面临着比男性更严格的审查。 在反穆巴拉克起义期间被捕的女性需要接受贞洁测试，以此作为恐吓手段。 在整个中东，伊斯兰军队骚扰、逮捕、强奸和虐待女性民主活动者。 1979年伊朗伊斯兰革命的模式 — — 将妇女视为二等公民 — — 被频繁视为如今由伊斯兰党派执政的阿拉伯国家的一大威胁。 这些国家都面临抉择。 妇女占据中东人口的一半，任何政治和经济发展希望都必须考虑到这一事实。 联合国发展计划署等组织一再发布报告，说明经济衰落和压抑女性之间存在��联。 一言以蔽之，除非妇女充分融入政治和经济生活，否则阿拉伯国家不可能获得成功。 在2011年诺贝尔和平奖获奖演说中，也门整治活动价卡尔曼（Tawakkol Karman）明确指出 ： “ 妇女问题的解决方案只有在民主社会中才能达成。 在民主社会中，人类能量得到了解放，女人和男人的能量都得到了解放 。 ” 中东国家应该保护和巩固妇女权利，以此作为强化民主思想和习惯的方式。 它们必须将《世界人权宣言》和其他国际法和协定制度化，以此消灭性别歧视和暴力。 妇女进步的希望就是美好社会的希望，就是一切发展皆有可能的希望。"

            "A Woman’s Place Is in the Digital Revolution MONTREAL – Digital technologies are a double-edged sword for the world’s women. Men’s greater access to these technologies puts women at risk of being left even further behind economically and socially. But if women can tap the full power of digital technologies, vital new opportunities will open up for them. According to estimates by the GSM Association, women’s access to the Internet and mobile phones is about 85% of the level for men, on average, and a total of 1.7 billion women in low- and middle-income countries are unconnected. This severely limits the prospects of women and girls. Digital technologies enhance women’s access to finance, with mobile banking enabling them to avoid long journeys to a branch or ATM. Likewise, technology-enabled health care delivered via phone or tablet improves health outcomes, as it reaches women even in the remotest areas, sparing them a long and often risky trek to see a doctor. The timesaving potential of digital technologies is so great that they may make the difference in enabling women to seek paid employment. Today, women undertake three-quarters of all unpaid care work, producing output of around $10 trillion, or 13% of global GDP – none of which is translated into income, let alone economic power. By their nature, e-commerce and technology-based businesses offer women more flexibility and autonomy, helping them to manage home responsibilities alongside paid work. In Indonesia, women-owned businesses generate 35% of e-commerce revenue, compared with only 15% of the revenue of offline businesses. Likewise, in China, 55% of new Internet businesses are founded by women, and Alibaba’s Taobao e-commerce platform has an equal number of male and female store owners. In fact, China is home to 114 of the world’s 147 self-made female billionaires, compared to just 14 in the second-place country, the United States. Women’s economic empowerment is good not just for the women who benefit. The McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) has estimated that advancing gender equality could add $12 trillion per year to the world economy by 2025. In the Asia-Pacific region alone, getting more women into full-time employment in higher-paid, higher-productivity sectors could add $4.5 trillion per year to GDP, 12% above the current trajectory. At the company level, a growing body of evidence shows that more gender equality is good for bottom lines. Greater diversity of leadership styles improves the quality of decision-making. If given the opportunity, women could be leading innovators in the age of automation and artificial intelligence, and could help to ensure that algorithms are free of gender bias. But major barriers prevent women from seizing these opportunities. For example, in India, where only 29% of all Internet users are female, girls in rural areas often face gender-based restrictions on their use of information and communications technologies. One village in Uttar Pradesh implemented a fine for any girl using a mobile phone outside the home. Beyond the social attitudes that undermine women’s access to digital technologies, women and girls often disproportionately lack the requisite skills to seize the opportunities of the digital age. In Singapore, for example, women lag behind men in education in science, math, engineering, and technology. At Nanyang Technological University, females comprised only 27% of the undergraduate computer-science program in 2015-2016, despite accounting for half of all undergraduates at the university. What is at stake is not just women’s ability to seize the opportunities offered by the digital revolution, but also their capacity to withstand the coming wave of automation. According to MGI research, in Singapore alone, 800,000 full-time-equivalent jobs could be displaced by 2030 due to automation. The jobs that are most vulnerable to automation are the low-paid, lower-skill jobs that women are more likely to hold. At the same time, though automation risks disrupting many jobs (or tasks within jobs) for both men and women, it also takes some of the drudgery out of current work, tailoring it to human abilities. The result could be higher wages that contribute to the creation of more new jobs – 300-365 million worldwide – as spending increases, with emerging economies gaining the most. Furthermore, among the new jobs that will be created will be many in fields like education and health care, where women have traditionally thrived. According to MGI research, more than 100 million jobs could be created over the next 10-15 years as health care and education needs grow. It is not yet clear exactly how automation will affect women’s employment. But there is no doubt that protecting – and even enhancing – women’s job and income prospects will require upgrading their skills, so that they can take advantage of the new and changing opportunities created by the ongoing digital revolution. The success of women in e-commerce attests to the power of digital technologies to level the economic playing field, to the benefit of individual women, their communities and societies, and the world economy. More women in work – particularly in the technology industries that are shaping our collective future – would be good news for all.",
            "妇女的地位在于数字革命 蒙特利尔—数字技术对全世界妇女而言是一柄双刃剑。 男性更容易获得这些技术，这使得妇女有可能在经济和社会角度进一步落后。 但如果妇女能够充分利用数字技术的力量，就能获得至关重要的新机会。 据GSM协会的估计，妇女能够上网和拥有手机的比例平均而言只有男性的85%左右，中低收入国家的17亿妇女无网可上。 这严重限制了妇女和女童的前景。 数字技术能增加妇女的金融普及，移动银行让她们不再需要长途跋涉才能用上网点或ATM机。 类似地，基于技术的医疗通过手机或平板电脑实现，能够改善健康结果，即使是最偏远地区的妇女也能获得这些服务，而不再需要冒风险长途跋涉去看医生。 数字技术在节约时间上的潜力非常巨大，有可能打开妇女寻找带薪工作的新局面。 如今，妇女承担了四分之三的无薪工作，贡献了大约10万亿美元的产出，或全球GDP的13 % — —其中没有一分钱转化为她们的收入，更不用说经济实力了。 电子商务和基于技术的企业天然能够为妇女提供灵活性和自治力，帮助她们做家务和挣工资两不误。 在印度尼西亚，妇女所有企业创造了35%的电子商务营收，而线下企业的这一比例只有15 % 。 类似地，在中国，有55%的新互联网企业由妇女创办，阿里巴巴的淘宝电商平台上男女店主数量一样多。 事实上，全世界147位白手起家的女亿万富豪有114位在中国，而第二名的美国只有14位。 妇女经济赋权的好处不只限于妇女受益者。 麦肯锡全球研究所（MGI）测算，到2025年，性别平等的改善每年能够为世界经济增加12万亿美元产出。 光是在亚太地区，让更多妇女在薪酬和生产率更高的行业获得全职工作每年能增加4.5万亿美元GDP，较当前水平提高12 % 。 在公司层面，越来越多的证据表明促进性别平等对利润有利。 领导风格的多样化能改善决策质量，在得到机会的情况下，妇女能够在自动化和人工智能时代成为创新领导者，帮助确保算法免受性别歧视干扰。 但妇女要抓住这些机会，面临着巨大的障碍。 比如，在印度只有29互联网用户是女性，农村女童常常会因为性别而被限制使用信息和通讯技术。 在北方邦的一个村庄，女童在家外使用手机会被罚款。 除了社会态度干扰妇女获得数字技术之外，妇女和女童还常常缺少抓住数字时代的机会所需要的技能。 比如，在新加坡，妇女的科学、数学、工程和技术教育水平落后于男性。 在南洋理工大学，2015—2016学年计算机科学专业本科生女生数量只占27 % ， 尽管全部本科生中有一半是女生。 重要的不只是妇女抓住数字革命所提供的机会的能力，也包括她们面对即将到来的自动化浪潮的能力。 据MGI的研究，光是在新加坡，到2030年有800,000个全职等价工作可以被自动化所取代。 最容易受自动化冲击的工作是低薪低技能工作，也是妇女更有可能从事的工作。 与此同时，尽管自动化风险对男性和女性的许多工作（或工作任务）都构成了破坏，但它也承担了当前工作的一些苦力活，让工作更能彰显人的能力。 结果可能是工资提高，形成更多新岗位 — — 全世界范围内高达3—3.65亿个 — — 原因在于支出增加，其中新兴经济体获益最多。 此外，新形成的工作岗位许多在于教育和医疗等传统女性优势领域。 据MGI的研究，随着医疗和教育需求的增加，未来10—15年能够创造出1亿多个工作岗位。 自动化具体如何影响妇女就业尚不清楚。 但毫无疑问，保护 — — 甚至加强 — — 妇女就业和收入前景需要升级她们的技能，以便她们能够抓住数字革命所创造的日新月异的机会。 妇女在电子商务方面所取得的成功证明了数字技术在建立公平竞争以及为妇女个体、社区和社会，以及世界经济带来收益等方面的力量。 更多女性进入职场 — — 特别是改变着我们的集体未来的科技行业 — — 对所有人都是好消息。"

            "The Media’s #MeToo Problem LONDON – Journalism classrooms may be dominated by women, but global media are still ruled by men, who occupy the majority of management positions, report more news stories and are more frequently presented as expert voices. This imbalance is reflected in the content newsrooms produce, with fewer written words and broadcast seconds dedicated to telling women’s stories. It is also reflected in the industry’s culture, which leaves women more vulnerable to sexual harassment and abuse. Given the importance of relationship-building in media, not to mention the desire for connection among journalists who cover extreme or harrowing events in difficult environments, intimate ties can easily form among colleagues and associates. The problem arises when these relationships turn sour or, worse, when they are non-consensual or based on coercion, such as when a more senior colleague pursues a sexual relationship with a subordinate. Of course, across countries, there can be significant differences in what is considered predatory or inappropriate behavior. But, globally, almost half of women journalists report having experienced work-related sexual harassment, according to a 2014 study by the International News Safety Institute (INSI) and the International Women’s Media Foundation (IWMF). Two-thirds reported that they had faced “intimidation, threats, or abuse,” mostly by bosses, supervisors, or co-workers. For perpetrators, impunity remains the norm. Almost three-fifths of respondents in the INSI/IWMF study who had experienced harassment said that they had reported incidents to their employers. In most cases, however, it was the women who experienced the abuse who suffered adverse consequences: damaged reputations and career prospects, not to mention the impact on their psychological and emotional wellbeing. So while men with histories of predatory behavior continue to occupy senior positions in the global news industry, women journalists are pushed to the point that they consider leaving it. In a recent survey by the IWMF and TrollBusters, one-third of respondents said that they had considered abandoning journalism; those at earlier stages in their careers were twice as likely to say that they were considering work in other fields because of the threats and attacks they received, in person or online. Despite the obstacles they face, more women appear to be rising in the ranks of the global media industry, even though progress is relatively slow. In digital newsrooms, which often have fewer of the inherent inequities of legacy media, the number of women in leadership positions appears to be growing faster. However, the “bro” culture in certain newer newsrooms carries its own sexual harassment risks for women. Meanwhile, in the United States, several high-profile male journalists have lost their jobs in the last year over allegations of inappropriate behavior toward their female colleagues – part of the broader #MeToo movement. But, overall, newsrooms continue to fail to take seriously the threats female journalists face on the job, both in their own workplaces and in the field. While newsrooms conduct risk assessment and deployment discussions regarding journalists in the field – where women can be particularly vulnerable to unwelcome advances from male colleagues, contacts, or strangers – they rarely account for the specific threats women face, at least not in a sufficiently nuanced way. This may be partly because, for major news organizations, these assessments are often handled in consultation with safety advisers – usually former military men, who may not fully appreciate the particular risks women face. Sometimes, the safety advisers turn out to be perpetrators of sexual harassment. Anecdotally, I know of several journalists who have been sexually harassed by safety advisers. Depending on where this takes place, such behavior can have significant security implications. As if that were not enough pressure, female foreign correspondents who are assaulted in the field often find themselves at the center of debates about whether women should be deployed on certain stories at all. Male correspondents are never the subjects of such debates. This macho myopia reinforces the damaging imbalance in perspectives shaping the media. It also carries significant economic costs. As the Harvard Business Review put it, “we all pay the price” when sexual harassment continues or is covered up. By impeding women from advancing within the industry or compelling them to change jobs, harassment diminishes their earning potential and deprives society of the best use of its talents. The fact is that journalists of various genders, ethnicities, and backgrounds experience different environments differently, in terms of both the risks they face and the rewards they can reap. Any assessment of a story needs to account for that nuance, with managers choosing the best journalist for the job – and providing the support needed to keep all journalists safe. To change the organizational culture that has enabled harassment and other forms of abuse against women – a moral obligation, as well as a legal and economic imperative – newsroom managers must lead from the top. Change will not happen overnight, nor will it be driven by a single actor. Leaders should listen to the women in their ranks, and invite diverse perspectives to help effect change. The goal is not to pit young against old or women against men. It is to rectify the media industry’s failure to protect its most vulnerable workers. We all pay when that failure prevents women journalists from achieving their full potential.",
            "媒体的“米兔”问题 伦敦—新闻学教室中也许大部分是女性，但全球媒体仍然由男性主宰，他们占据了大部分管理岗位，报道更多新闻，也更常代表专业声音发声。 这一失衡反映在新闻编辑室所“生产”的内容中，用于讲述女性故事的纸媒文字和广播声音都更少。 它也反映在行业文化中，女性更容易受到性骚扰和侵犯的影响。 在媒体行业，构建关系十分重要，尤其是排除万难报道极端或恐怖事件的记者们更加渴望联系，因此，同事和搭档之间很容易形成紧密联系。 当这些关系变坏，或者更糟糕地，当它们变成非自愿或基于强迫时，问题就会产生，比如上司要求和下属发生性关系时。 当然，不同国家对于侵犯或不恰当行为的定义大相径庭。 但据国际新闻安全研究所（INSI）和国际妇女媒体基金会（IWMF）的一项2014年的研究，全球而言，近一半的女记者报告经历过与工作相关的性骚扰。 三分之二的女记者报告她们曾面临过“恐吓，威胁或暴力 ” ， 这些行为大多来自上司、督查和同事。 施害者通常不会受到任何惩罚。 在INSI/IWMF的研究中报告曾经历过性骚扰的受访者中，有近五分之三说她们向雇主报告过情况。 但最常见的结果是遭受暴力的女性承受负面后果：名声败坏，职业生涯受阻，更不用说身心伤害了。 因此，有过侵犯行为史的男性继续占据全球媒体行业高位，而女记者被推向被迫离开媒体业的边缘。 在一项IWMF和TrollBusters进行的最新调查中，三分之一的受访者说她们考虑过离开新闻业；处于职业生涯初期的人因为受到威胁和攻击（包括人身攻击和在线攻击）而考虑换行的可能性要高出一倍。 尽管面临着这些障碍，但更多的女性正在攀升到全球媒体行业的更高职位，虽然进步相对较慢。 数字新闻行业的固有不平等性较之传统媒体更低，获得领导岗位的女性数量增长得更快。 但是，一些较新的新闻媒体的“兄弟”文化给女性带来了新的性骚扰风险。 与此同时，在美国，去年有一些身居高位的男记者因为被控对女同事有不当行为而丢掉了饭碗。 这些指控是广泛的“米兔 ” （ #MeToo）运动的一部分。 但总体而言，新闻媒体仍然没有正视女记者所面临的职场威胁 — — 不管是在办公室中还是在外勤。 新闻媒体会就外勤记者的风险评估和部署进行讨论 — — 跑外勤的女性尤其容易受到来自男同事、线人或陌生人指使不喜欢的工作 — — 他们几乎不会考虑女性所面临的特殊威胁，至少不会充分细致地考虑。 部分原因也许在于，对主要新闻组织而言，这些评估通常是根据安全顾问的意见进行的 — — 这些安全顾问往往是男性退伍军人，未必能充分理解女性所面临的特殊风险。 有时，安全顾问也会成为性骚扰的施害者。 我就知道一些传言，有记者被安全顾问性骚扰。 取决于这些骚扰所发生的地点，它们可能造成重大安全隐患。 雪上加霜的是，在出外勤时遭到攻击的外国记者，常常会发现自己成为应不应该让女性负责报道某些新闻的争论的核心。 男记者永远不会成为这些争论的对象。 这一大男子主义近视强化了影响媒体的失衡，也造成了巨大的经济成本。 《哈佛商业评论》指出，当性骚扰不断或被掩盖时 ， “ 我们都要付出代价 。 ” 性骚扰阻挠女性在业内获得晋升或迫使她们换工作，拖累了她们的薪酬潜力，也让社会无从最好地利用人才。 事实上，不同性别、种族和背景的记者，能以不同的方式体验不同的环境，包括他们所面临的风险和能够获得的奖励。 对报道的评估都必须考虑到这一细节，管理者要为任务遴选最佳记者 — — 并提供需要的支持保证所有记者安全。 要改变让女性饱受骚扰和其他形式的暴力的组织文化 — — 这既是道德义务，也是法律和经济当务之急 — — 新闻组织管理者必须起到领导作用。 变化不会一夜之间发生，也不会由某个人以一己之力推动。 领导者必须倾听女下属的声音，吸收多样化的视角来推动有效的变化。 目标不是爱惜年轻人或怜香惜玉。 而是纠正媒体行业无法保护最脆弱员工的状况。 当这方面的失败阻挠女记者充分实现潜力时，我们所有人都会付出代价。"

            "It’s Time to Let Women Thrive DAVOS – In public debates around the world, women’s empowerment is increasingly being recognized as a top priority. The question of how to provide more economic opportunities for women is firmly on the agenda at the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos this year. And longtime advocates for women are feeling energized, as countless others – men and women alike – have come to recognize the urgency of the task. Affording women and girls the opportunity to succeed is not just the right thing to do; it can also transform societies and economies for the good of all. For example, bringing women’s labor force participation up to the same level as that of men would boost GDP by as much as 9% in Japan and 27% in India. The International Monetary Fund has documented many other macroeconomic benefits associated with women’s empowerment. Reducing gender gaps in employment and education has been shown to help economies diversify their exports. Appointing more women to banking-supervision boards can prevent cozy groupthink, thereby ensuring greater stability and resilience in the financial sector. And reducing gender inequalities also reduces income inequality, allowing for more sustainable growth. Closing the gender gap may seem like a tall order, but it is essential for long-term economic development and prosperity. The challenge for every country, then, is to make the most of all of its people’s talents. Realizing women’s potential is a universal mission. But some of the barriers holding women back are also universal. Astonishingly, almost 90% of countries have one or more gender-based legal restrictions on the books. In some countries, women still have limited property rights compared to men; in others, husbands have the right to forbid their wives from working. Beyond legal barriers, women also face social and cultural obstacles that limit their access to education, work, and finance. This is especially true in countries with fragile political systems. Now that public awareness of is growing, it is time to press ahead with concrete measures to help women remain in the workforce while raising a family. For a glimpse of what that might look like, consider Norway, where affordable childcare and parental-leave schemes have proven successful in enabling both mothers and fathers to work. Yes, these programs are costly. But they are well worth the investment, given employed women’s enormous contribution to economic growth. Moreover, programs that help women keep working also change the role of fathers. In Norway and other countries with similar policies, fathers now share equally in parental leave and child-rearing. As a result, more women can pursue leadership roles in work and public life. Of course, countries that are not yet at Norway’s level of economic development typically face other gender-related challenges, including limited access to water and education. Unfortunately, while many countries have made progress in reducing gender gaps in primary-school enrollment, there is still much more work to be done at the secondary and tertiary levels. As long as these gaps persist, women will not be able to aspire to political and economic power on an equal footing with men. Accordingly, Norway has made girls’ education a top priority in its international-development programs. Beyond education, ensuring that women in developing countries have access to finance is critical, because it enables them to participate fully in the economy, including as entrepreneurs. When women are empowered to start their own businesses, they can drive innovation and help their countries prosper. Because women’s labor-force participation is so important for growth, organizations such as the IMF are committed to working with governments around the world to empower women economically. IMF-supported programs in Egypt and Jordan, for example, include measures to boost investment in public nurseries and safe public transportation. In addition to specific policies, today’s conversation has increasingly focused on the need for wider social change. And now that movements such as #Equalpay and #MeToo have gained so much momentum, it looks like that change could be coming. It has been inspiring to see so many women, girls, and – yes – men speaking out against retrograde attitudes toward women, which have been holding all of us back. With the global economy recovering, governments must now lay the foundation for long-term growth, by creating the conditions for women everywhere to realize their full potential. Discrimination and abuse against women can no longer stand. It is time for women to thrive.",
            "是时候让女性繁荣 达沃斯 — — 在世界各地的公开辩论中，女性授权越来越被认为是重中之重。 今年在达沃斯召开的世界经济论坛年会上，如何为女性提供更多经济机会已经牢牢地登上了议事日程。 女性权利的长期倡导者正在感受到这种活力，因为无数其他人 — — 无论男女 — — 都已经开始认识到这项任务的紧迫性。 为妇女和女童提供成功的机遇不仅是对的；它还可以改造经济和社会，让所有人都过上更好的生活。 例如，将女性参与劳动的比率提高到与男性同等水平能使日本国内生产总值增长高达9 % ， 印度则可以增长27%之多。 国际货币基金组织已经记录了与女性授权相关的其他许多宏观经济好处。 事实证明缩小就业和教育方面的性别差距有助于经济体实现出口多样化。 任命更多女性加入银行监管委员会可以防止惬意的团体思维，进而确保金融部门的弹性和稳定。 降低性别不平等还可以降低收入不平等，从而使经济增长更可持续。 缩小性别差距可能看似一项很难完成的任务，但却对长期经济发展和繁荣至关重要。 因此，充分发挥民众的能力是各国所面临的难题。 充分发挥妇女潜力是一项普遍的使命。 但阻止妇女进步的某些障碍同样具有普遍性。 令人惊讶的是， 近90%的国家都有至少一项以性别为基础的法律限制。 在某些国家，与男性相比女性的财产权依然有限；而在另外一些国家，丈夫则有权禁止妻子外出工作。 除法律障碍外，女性还面临社会及文化障碍，限制她们接受教育、获得融资和外出工作。 政治制度脆弱的国家尤其是这样。 现在公众意识不断增强，是时候全力推行具体政策，协助女性在养家糊口的同时继续留在劳动力市场。 只需以挪威为例就可以了解可能的状况，那里廉价的儿童保育和育儿假计划已经证明使父母双方同时加入劳动力队伍可以做到。 没错，这样的计划非常昂贵。 但鉴于就业妇女对经济增长作出的巨大贡献，这样的投资非常值得。 此外，协助女性继续工作的计划同样也改变了父亲的角色。 在挪威和其他实行类似政策的国家，父亲现在平等地享受育儿假并承担抚养子女的义务。 因此，更多女性可以在工作和公共生活中发挥领导作用。 当然，经济发展水平尚不能与挪威相媲美的国家往往面临着与性别有关的其他挑战，包括获得的饮用水和教育机会不足。 令人遗憾的是，虽然许多国家在缩小小学入学率差距方面已经取得了进展，但在中学和大学层面还有许多工作要做。 只要这些差距依然存在，妇女就无法追求与男性同等的政治和经济权力。 除教育外，确保发展中国家女性融资权至关重要，因为这能使她们充分参与经济，包括成为企业家。 当妇女有权开办企业时，她们就可以推动创新并协助国家实现繁荣。 因为女性劳动力对经济增长尤为重要，像国际货币基金组织这样的机构正致力于与世界各国政府合作，实现在经济领域为女性授权的目标。 例如，国际货币基金组织在埃及和约旦支持的项目包括加大对公共托儿所和安全公共交通的投资力度。 除具体政策外，今天的对话越来越关注对大范围社会变革的需求。 而现在像#薪酬平等和#我也是这样的运动已经引发了如此大的反响，看起来这样的变化可能即将到来了。 看到这么多妇女、女童 — — 还有男性 — — 公然抨击对女性的落后态度确实令人鼓舞，因为这样的态度一直在阻止我们发展进步。 随着全球经济复苏，各国政府现在必须通过为各国妇女充分发挥潜能创造条件，从而为长期经济增长奠定基础。 对妇女的歧视和虐待决不能继续存在。 现在是时候让妇女实现繁荣。"

            "The Pandemic Threat to Female Leadership STANFORD – One in four. That’s the proportion of American women who are considering downshifting their careers or leaving the workforce due to the impact of COVID-19. In just one year, the pandemic has driven more than two million women in the United States out of the workplace, resulting in the largest male-female unemployment gap in two decades. Working mothers, more than 40% of whom are their family’s primary breadwinner, have been especially hit hard. Many simply are unable to balance their careers with overwhelming increases in household responsibilities at home. This mirrors similar trends globally – across all regions, women lost jobs at a greater rate than men in 2020, as they took on an average of 30 more hours of childcare per week. COVID-19 is causing women to leave the workforce in droves just when we urgently need to elevate more of them into leadership positions across sectors, including in our own field of global health. Without women’s expertise, leadership talents, and unique perspectives, the road to recovery could be far longer, and we risk being underprepared for the next health crisis, particularly given the pandemic’s clear gendered effects. And having women in leadership positions has been shown to result in more policies that improve people’s quality of life and reflect the priorities of families and marginalized communities – the very groups disproportionately affected by this pandemic. In global health, women’s voices are crucial to driving intentional, holistic action on important challenges that too often are missed when the vast majority of decision-makers are men. When women are not at the table, the consequences are serious. This pandemic has led to increases in domestic violence and suspensions or delays in sexual and reproductive health services, often leaving unprepared governments struggling to respond. For too long, we lacked sex-disaggregated data, including on how both COVID-19 infection and vaccination affect pregnant women, simply because researchers do not routinely investigate these questions. We will continue to struggle with these and other issues unless women are better represented in decision-making. But as we rebuild from the devastation of COVID-19, we have an opportunity to embrace new and better ways of working so that parents do not have to choose between their careers and their family responsibilities – and so that women can thrive and lead. In global health, like in other fields, this starts with acknowledging and breaking down barriers and urging those in positions of power to embrace the necessary changes in policies, allocation of resources, and cultural norms. For starters, we must make our workplaces more family-friendly through measures such as flexible schedules, subsidized childcare, and family leave. We must also dismantle the sexist biases that hold back women in their careers, including false, negative assumptions about mothers that have adverse implications in hiring and promotion decisions. Furthermore, we need to recognize that pandemic-related challenges have not affected all women equally. In the US, like in many other countries, women who already face additional hurdles – whether because they are black, Hispanic, or unpartnered mothers – have shouldered an even heavier load. We must advocate for policies that can correct this imbalance. In particular, such policies should include universal childcare, which helps address inequalities faced by marginalized women. Women should not have to sacrifice their health, work, or leadership potential in the pursuit of the mythical “work-life balance.” The best leadership we can muster – drawing from all humankind, and not just 50% of it – is needed to improve health outcomes and the well-being of people around the world. Millions of women have already left the workforce during this pandemic, and many more are thinking of doing so. If we do not act now to reverse this trend, the gap may become insurmountable. We cannot afford to lose the very people who will help lead us out of this health emergency and future ones, too.",
            "妇女领导力的疫情威胁 斯坦福 – 四分之一。 这是美国妇女因为新冠影响而考虑因转行或离职的比例。 在短短一年内，疫情已使美国200多万妇女 离开职场，造成 20年来最大的男女失业差距。 职业母亲（40%以上 是家庭的主要收入源）受到的打击尤其严重。 许多人根本无法平衡事业和家庭责任的压倒性增加。 这也体现了类似的全球趋势 — — 所有地区2020年妇女失业率都高于男性，因为她们平均每周要多花30小时用于育儿。 新冠正导致妇女大量离开劳动大军，而与此同时，我们正迫切需要将更多的妇女提升到各部门领导岗位，包括两位作者所在的全球卫生领域。 如果没有妇女的专业知识、领导才能和独特视角，复苏的道路可能更加漫长，我们有可能无法为下一次健康危机做好准备，特别是考虑到新冠疫情显而易见对性别 影响差异。 事实证明，让妇女担任领导职务将产生更多改善生活质量，反映家庭和边缘化社区当务之急政策 — — 他们正是新冠疫情影响最大的群体。 在全球卫生方面，妇女的声音对于推动有意识的全面行动克服重要挑战至关重要，而当绝大多数决策者是男性时，这些挑战往往被遗漏。 妇女不参与决策后果很严重。 这场疫情导致家庭暴力增加，性和生殖健康服务 暂停或延迟，令许多措手不及的政府焦头烂额。 长期以来，我们缺乏性别分类数据，包括新冠感染和疫苗接种对孕妇的影响等，这完全是因为研究人员没有定期调查这些问题。 除非妇女能够在决策过程中得到更好的代表，否则我们将继续面临这样和那样的问题。 但是，当我们从新冠的废墟中重建时，我们有机会采用更好的新工作方式，让父母不必在事业和家庭责任之间做出选择 — — 妇女也可以出人头地。 与其他领域一样，在全球卫生领域，首先必须承认和打破壁垒，敦促当权者接受改变政策、资源分配和文化规范的重要性。 首先，我们必须通过弹性工作制、育儿补贴和探亲假等措施，让职场对家庭更加友好。 我们还必须消除阻碍妇女事业的性别歧视，包括对母亲的就业和晋升决定产生不利影响的错误、消极的假设。 此外，我们需要认识到，疫情相关的挑战对不同妇女影响不同。 像许多其他国家一样，在美国，已然需要面临额外阻碍的妇女 — — 无论是 黑人、西班牙裔，还是 单身母亲 — — 肩上的担子变得更加沉重了。 我们必须倡导能够纠正这种不平衡的政策。 特别是，这种政策应包括普及保育，这有助于解决 边缘化妇女面临的不平等问题。 女性在追求神话般的\"工作与生活平衡\"时，完全应该可以不必牺牲健康、工作或领导潜力。 我们需要能够实现的最好的领导力 — — 它来自全体人类，而不仅仅是其中的50 % — —来改善健康结果和全世界人民的福祉。 新冠疫情导致数百万妇女已经离开劳动大军，并且还有更多妇女正在考虑这样做。 如果我们现在不采取行动扭转这一趋势，差距就可能变得不可逾越。 我们也绝不能失去那些能够帮助我们这场和未来战胜卫生紧急状况的人。"

            "How Women Can Power the Green Transition BRASÍLIA – The world needs to shift from the current fossil-fuel-based energy system to carbon neutrality. Most obviously, this will require countries to roll out renewable energy and integrate it into the electricity grid, boost energy efficiency, upgrade infrastructure, and refine the governance of electricity and energy markets. Less apparent, success will require that women are able to contribute to the transition on an equal footing with men. Energy transitions will differ depending on countries’ development priorities, the proportion of the population with access to power grids, the current energy mix, and projected demand. Some transitions may involve simply retrofitting old, unsustainable assets in order to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, while others may be part of a multifaceted development strategy for societal transformation, including gender equality and inclusion. But all countries should commit to creating jobs and leaving no one behind. Although the available data vary considerably, women probably represent – at most – one-third of the global sustainable energy workforce. And their share typically is much lower in the so-called STEM professions (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) and in executive positions. Unsurprisingly, awareness of gender dynamics in the workplace also tends to be low. Moreover, policies that could help redress the current imbalance in the sector – such as flextime, parental leave, return-to-work schemes, bias-free recruitment and promotion, and gender-balanced boards and panels – are scarce. These barriers to the full participation of women are, first and foremost, an infringement of human rights, in particular women’s right to full and equal participation in the life of their communities. Governments therefore have a duty to eliminate discrimination against women and establish frameworks to help empower them and enable their advancement. In addition, the under-representation of women deprives energy transitions of diverse talent, and thus impedes the transformational change required to achieve global climate targets and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Conversely, the equal participation of women in the workforce is demonstrably good for business, the economy, social development, and the environment. These findings are not new. In its 2012 World Development Report, for example, the World Bank emphasized that gender equality not only is a core development objective in its own right, but also enhances an economy’s productivity and improves future generations’ prospects. And during the 2009 global economic downturn, a global survey by the consulting firm McKinsey & Company concluded that women leaders represent “a competitive edge in and after the crisis.” Likewise, having a higher percentage of women in decision-making positions increases innovation and profitability, decreases risk, and enhances sustainability practices. Green-energy transitions provide opportunities to tackle systemic gender discrimination and enable societies to reap the benefits of a more diverse workforce. That is partly because sustainable energy is a new and fast-growing field: the number of people employed worldwide in the sector is expected to increase from an estimated 11 million today to over 42 million in 2050. In addition, the scope of the transitions calls for a diverse range of skills, including civil engineering, environmental science, marketing, teaching, and community action. The good news is that governments, firms, and universities around the world are implementing a wide variety of strategies to make the green transition more diverse and inclusive. For example, Rwanda’s 2003 constitution sets a mandatory minimum female quota of 30% for all decision-making bodies, including those related to sustainable development and energy. The mandatory quota sent a powerful signal to society and was more than doubly filled in both the 2013 and 2018 parliamentary elections, in which women won more than 60% of the seats. In the business world, Turkish firm Polat Energy recently took out a $44 million “gender loan” to finance the construction of Turkey’s largest wind farm. The loan terms will improve if the company demonstrates further progress toward gender equality relative to an initial baseline. Elsewhere in the energy sector, Wind Denmark has gone beyond the country’s already generous parental leave policy for both women and men, while ScottishPower is championing a “return to work” program. Likewise, wind turbine manufacturer Siemens Gamesa promotes flexible work arrangements and transparent pay-gap analysis, leading the United Kingdom’s government to certify recently that the company’s female employees in the UK earn 95% of what their male colleagues do. Academic institutions and NGOs are also playing their part. The Australian university UNSW Sydney has reported a 78% increase in female first-year engineering enrollments since it launched its Women in Engineering Program in 2014. And the Global Women’s Network for the Energy Transition, an international NGO that offers networking, mentoring, and training programs for women working in the energy sector, recently published a study on how to make sustainable energy more gender-diverse. Energy transitions are essential to limit global warming and build a more sustainable future. Achieving them is in everyone’s interest. As countries everywhere embark on “building back better” after COVID-19, energy transition strategies should be a key element in any stimulus package. And they will be far more likely to succeed if women play a central role.",
            "妇女如何推动绿色转型 巴西利亚—世界需要从目前的化石燃料能源系统转化为碳中性。 最显而易见的是，这需要各国推出可再生能源并将这些能源并入电网，以提升能源效率、升级基础设施，同时完善电力和能源市场的治理工作。 不那么显而易见的是，要想在上述领域取得成功，就需要女性在与男性平等的基础上为转型做工作。 能源转型将取决于各国的发展重点、接入电网的人口比例、目前的能源结构以及预期需求等方面的不同。 有些转型可能只涉及对原有不可持续资产的改造，从而减少二氧化碳排放，但还有一些转型可能成为社会转型多方面发展战略的组成部分，其中也包括性别平等和包容。 但所有国家均应致力于创造就业机会，并且惠及所有人。 尽管现有数据差别很大，但女性很有可能在全球可持续能源劳动人口中 — — 最多 — — 仅占1/3的份额。 而且在所谓的STEM专业（即科学、技术、工程和数学）以及行政岗位中，她们所占的份额往往要低得多。 毫不令人惊讶的是，工作场所对于性别动态的认识往往也非常滞后。 此外，能够有助于纠正当前行业不平衡的政策 — — 例如弹性工作时间、育儿假、返岗计划、摒弃偏见的招聘和晋升程序，以及性别平衡的董事会和专门委员会 — — 都是非常稀缺的。 上述阻止妇女全面参与的障碍首先属于侵犯人权，尤其是侵犯妇女全面平等参与社区生活的权利。 政府因此有责任消除对妇女的歧视并且建立框架，从而协助实现女性赋权并且促使她们进步。 此外，女性任职人数不足有损于能源转型人才实现多样化，从而阻碍了实现全球气候目标以及联合国可持续发展目标所需的转型性变革。 相反，妇女平等参与劳动显然对企业、经济、社会发展和环境都有好处。 这已经不是什么新成果。 例如在2012年的世界发展报告中，世界银行曾强调性别平等不仅本身就是核心发展目标，同时还可以提升经济效率及改善子孙后代的前途。 而在2009年全球经济衰退期间，咨询企业麦肯锡公司所做的一项全球调查显示，女性领袖代表着“危机期间及危机结束后的一种竞争优势 。 ” 同样，提高参与决策女性的百分比能够提升创新和盈利能力、降低风险并巩固可持续做法。 绿色能源转型为解决系统性性别歧视提供了机会，并使社会能够从更多样化的劳动人口中得到好处。 这部分因为可持续能源是一个快速增长的全新领域：该行业全球受雇人数预计将从今天的约1，100万增长到 2050年的超过4，200万。 此外，转型所涉及的领域要求员工具备多种多样的技能，其中包括土木工程、环境科学、市场营销、教育和社团行动。 好消息是，世界各地的政府、企业和大学正在实施多种多样的战略，从而使绿色转型更加多样化和包容。 例如，卢旺达2003年宪法为所有决策机构（其中包括可持续发展及能源相关决策机构）规定了30%的强制女性最低配额。 强制配额向社会发出了强有力的信号，而且2013和2018两年的议会选举都以女性获得60%以上席位的骄人战绩双倍实现了上述配额。 在商业领域，土耳其企业 Polat Energy最近拿到了一笔4，400亿美元的“性别贷款 ， ” 用于资助土耳其规模最大的风电厂建设。 该贷款条件还将进一步改善，前提是该公司证明，相对于初始基准在性别平等方面取得了更多进步。 在其他地方的能源行业，丹麦风力公司已经超越了该国本已十分慷慨的女性和男性育儿假政策 ，而苏格兰电力（Scottish Power）则正在推动一项“返岗”计划。 同样，风力涡轮机制造企业西门子歌美飒公司倡导灵活的工作安排和透明的薪酬差距分析，促使英国政府最近承认该公司在英国就职的女性员工收入是其男性同事的95 % 。 学术机构和非政府组织同样在发挥作用。 自2014年启动其工程项目女性参与计划以来，澳大利亚新南威尔士大学悉尼分校的女性一年级工程专业新生入学率报告增长了78 % 。 而国际非政府组织全球能源转型女性网络为能源行业就职的女性提供交流、辅导和培训服务，该机构最近公布了一项研究结果，揭示了如何让可持续能源行业更加性别多样化。 能源转型在限制全球变暖和建设更具持续性的未来方面所发挥的作用至关重要。 实现这一目标与所有人的利益相符。 随着世界各国在2019年新冠疫情结束后开始“更高质量的重建 ， ” 能源转型战略理应成为任何一揽子刺激计划中所必备的关键要素。 而且如果妇女能够发挥核心作用，那么他们将更有可能取得成功。"

            "Women on Top in the World’s Democracies MOSCOW – US President Donald Trump’s recent declaration that four Democratic congresswomen of color – Ayanna Pressley, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, and Rashida Tlaib – should “go back” to their countries was another reminder of his blatant racism and sexism. (Three of them were born in the United States, and the fourth became a US citizen as a teenager.) But it also highlighted the rising profiles of women in politics – a trend that will continue, no matter how much it terrifies insecure men like Trump. A century ago in Europe, leading suffragists – such as Inessa Armand, Rosa Luxemburg, and Clara Zetkin – had little choice but to seek powerful men to validate their aspirations. One such man was Soviet leader Vladimir Lenin, who advocated the elimination of “old laws which placed woman in inequality in relation to man.” Armand was (allegedly) romantically involved with Lenin, and Zetkin interviewed him on “the women’s question” in 1920, following his 1919 speech on the “tasks of the working women’s movement in the Soviet republic.” This approach was understandable, but it proved ineffective. Lenin insisted that only socialism – with its promise of equality for all – could liberate women. “Wherever the power of capital is preserved,” he declared in that speech, “the men retain their privileges.” But, while over 80% of women in the Soviet Union aged 15-54 had jobs (as of 1983), few had careers. During the Stalinist era, women were explicitly told to return to the “family front.” My own grandmother was forced to give up her position as an educator after my grandfather, Nikita Khrushchev, was appointed the head of Ukraine’s Communist Party in 1937. She was supposed to serve as an example for other working wives of political functionaries. Today, not only are there very few women in Russian President Vladimir Putin’s government; their roles are largely ceremonial. Tellingly, in a country where domestic abuse kills a woman every 40 minutes, on average, an amendment decriminalizing some forms of domestic violence sailed through the Duma (Russia’s parliament) in 2017, before being signed by Putin. By contrast, while many European democracies lagged behind the Soviets on women’s suffrage – Belgium, France, and Italy granted women full voting rights only in the 1940s – they have turned out to be far more conducive to women’s professional rise. Forty years ago, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, though often inflexible and dogmatic, helped to break the proverbial glass ceiling. And, in the last 15 years or so, the ladder has gotten higher – and more crowded – than ever. Angela Merkel has become Germany’s third-longest-serving chancellor since becoming the first woman to fill that post in 2005. Another woman, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, currently Germany’s defense minister, is likely to succeed her in 2021. The surge of women in politics spans Europe – and the political spectrum. Dalia Grybauskaitė, Lithuania’s own “Iron Lady,” who became her country’s first female president in 2009 (she left office this month), holds center-right views but is not affiliated with any political party. The conservative Erna Solberg, who became Norway’s prime minister in 2013, has managed to strike a balance between libertarianism and the welfare state. Yuliya Tymoshenko twice became Ukraine’s prime minister in a political environment saturated by male chauvinism. The liberal conservative Kersti Kaljulaid became Estonia’s first female head of state, and its youngest-ever president in 2016. And last month, the social democrat Mette Frederiksen was elected as Denmark’s youngest-ever prime minister, and the second woman to hold the office. Meanwhile, another powerful female politician, the nationalist Pia Kjærsgaard, who co-founded the Danish People’s Party, resigned as the speaker of Denmark’s parliament after holding that post for four years. Yet another far-right party, France’s National Rally (formerly the National Front), also has a woman leader, Marine Le Pen, who in 2011 succeeded her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, with the goal of making his extreme views more palatable and broadening the party’s appeal. Likewise, former British Prime Minister Theresa May was tasked with cleaning up the mess made by her male predecessor, David Cameron. Having called the Brexit referendum to appease the Euroskeptics in his Conservative Party, his only choice was to resign when the vote didn’t go his way. May, who also opposed leaving the European Union, was somehow supposed to make it work. (It couldn’t, so she didn’t.) Female representation is also on the rise at the European level. During her tenure as Europe’s competition commissioner, Denmark’s Margrethe Vestager took bold steps to rein in Big Tech. Former French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde, who became the International Monetary Fund’s first female managing director in 2011, is now set to be confirmed as the European Central Bank’s first female president. And Merkel’s protégé, Ursula von der Leyen, will take over as the European Commission’s first female president. As for the US, though former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton lost to Trump in 2016, she set an important precedent (and won more votes). The 2018 midterm elections brought a record number of women to the US Congress, including those four congresswomen who have been in Trump’s crosshairs. And two of the five frontrunners to take on Trump in the 2020 election are women. None of these women needs men’s validation. But that does not mean that they would not welcome men’s support, whether political, personal, or even artistic. For example, Philipp Stölzl is staging a contemporary adaptation of Giuseppe Verdi’s Rigoletto in Austria. In his view, Rigoletto – in which a court jester attempts to end the licentious activities of his powerful employer – is the ideal opera for the #MeToo era. Perhaps that is why a woman, Australian opera director Lindy Hume, is bringing her own adaptation of Rigoletto to Seattle next month. In today’s world, as in Rigoletto, men continue to hold disproportionate power, which they often use in ways that prevent women from gaining more. But, judging by the fast-growing number of women on the political stage – and given that they include fascists, liberals, greens, and socialists – the days of male supremacy are numbered. No wonder that we are witnessing a backlash from “alpha males” like Trump.",
            "在世界民主国家身居高位的女性 莫斯科—美国总统特朗普最近宣称四位民主党有色国会女议员—阿雅娜·佩雷斯利（Ayanna Pressley ） 、 亚历山德里亚·奥卡西奥-克尔特兹（Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez ） 、 伊尔汗·奥马尔（Ilhan Omar）和拉西达·塔莱布（Rashida Tlaib）应该“滚回”她们的国家，这再次证明了他赤裸裸的种族主义和性别歧视。 （其中三人出生于美国，另一位十几岁时成为美国公民。 ）但这也突显出妇女政治地位的日益显赫—这一趋势将继续保持下去，不论特朗普之流如何噤若寒蝉。 一个世纪前，在欧洲，妇女参政先锋 — — 如伊涅萨·埃尔曼德（Inessa Armand ） 、 罗莎·卢森堡（Rosa Luxemburg）和克拉拉·泽钦（Clara Zetkin）等 — — 别无选择，只能求助权势男性认可自己的雄心。 其中一位男性是苏联领导人列宁，他号召消灭“将妇女置于与男性不对等地位的就法律 。 ” 埃尔曼德（据说）与列宁有一段罗曼史，而泽钦在1920年就“妇女问题”访问了列宁。 在此之前的1919年，列宁发表了关于“苏维埃共和国的职业妇女运动的任务”的讲话。 这一策略不难理解，但收效甚微。 列宁认定只有社会主义 — — 及其人人平等的承诺 — — 能够解放妇女。 “只要资本的力量存在 ， ” 他在1919年的讲话中说 ， “ 男性就将保持特权 。 ” 但是尽管80%的15—54岁苏联妇女拥有工作（1983年 ） ， 却很少有妇女拥有事业。 在斯大林时期，妇女被明确要求回归 “家庭前线 ” 。 1937年我的祖父赫鲁晓夫被任命为乌克兰共产党总书记后，我的祖母便被迫放弃了教育家的职业。 她原本可以成为其他政界要人配偶成为职业妇女的榜样。 如今，俄罗斯总统普京政府内妇女凤毛麟角；角色也往往是充当花瓶。 显然，在这个家庭暴力平均每40分钟就要杀害一名妇女的国家，2017年杜马（俄罗斯议会）又通过了一份将某些家庭暴力去罪化的修正案，并交由普京签署。 相反，尽管许多欧洲民主国家在妇女参政权方面落后于苏联 — — 比利时、法国和意大利直到20世纪40年代才授予妇女完整的选举权 — — 但它们在妇女职业提升方面做得更好。 四十年前，英国首相撒切尔夫人 — — 尽管失之僵化和教条 — — 帮助打破了传说中的玻璃天花板。 在过去15年左右的时间里，妇女职位越来越高，数量也越来越众。 默克尔在2005年成为德国首位女总理，现已成为执政时间第三长的总理。 另一位妇女 — — 现任德国国防部长安妮格雷特·克朗普-卡伦鲍尔（Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer）有望在2021年接替她。 妇女在政界崛起已成为遍布整个政治谱系的欧洲普遍现象。 立陶宛“铁娘子”格里包斯凯特在2009年成为立陶宛首位女总统（已在本月卸任 ） ， 她持中右翼立场，但不隶属于任何政党。 保守派索尔伯格在2013年成为挪威首相，成功地在自由主义和福利国家之间达成平衡。 季莫申科在大男子主义盛行的政治环境中，两次成为乌克兰总理。 2016年，自由保守派卡尤莱德成为爱沙尼亚首位女国家元首，也是有史以来最年轻的爱沙尼亚总统。 上个月，社会民主党人弗雷德里克森当选丹麦有史以来最年轻的首相，也是第二位执政的妇女。 与此同时，另一位权势女政治家、民族主义者、丹麦人民党（Danish People’s Party）联合创始人皮娅·加尔斯加尔德（Pia Kjærsgaard）在任职四年后辞去了丹麦议会议长一职。 但另一个极右翼政党，法国的国民联盟（National Rally，即此前的国民阵线）也有一位女领导人 — — 玛琳娜·勒庞（Marine Le Pen ） ， 她在2011年接任其父让-马里·勒庞（Jean-Marie Le Pen ） ， 目标是要让他的极端思想更加吸引人，扩大本党的号召力。 类似地，英国前首相梅肩负着替前任卡梅伦收拾烂摊子的重任。 卡梅伦为了安抚保守党内的疑欧派而进行了脱欧公投，而当投票结果未如他意时，他唯一的选择便是辞职。 梅反对脱离欧盟，但要让脱欧成行。 （这是不可能的，因此她没有做到。 ） 欧洲层面的妇女地位也在提高。 在担任欧洲竞争委员期间，丹麦人玛格丽特·维斯塔格（Margrethe Vestager）在治理科技巨头方面采取了大胆的举措。 法国前财政部长拉加德在2011年成为国际货币基金组织首任女总裁，现在即将被确认为欧洲央行首任女行长。 而默克尔的门徒厄尔苏拉·冯德莱恩（Ursula von der Leyen）将接任欧盟委员会首任女主席。 之于美国，尽管前国务卿希拉里·克林顿（Hillary Clinton）在2016年输给了特朗普，但她已经树立了重要的先例（并赢得了更多的选票 ） 。 2018年中期选举中，进入美国国会的妇女人数创下了记录，其中包括这四名被特朗普枪口盯上的女议员。 2020年竞选的五位领跑者中也有两名妇女。 所有这些女性都不需要男性的批准。 但这并不意味着她们不欢迎男性的支持，不管是政治、个人甚至风度上的支持。 比如，菲利普·斯托泽尔（Philipp Stölzl）正在奥地利上演威尔第的《弄臣》的当代版本。 在他看来 ， 《 弄成 》 — —在这部戏剧中，宫廷小丑试图阻止他的权势雇主的放纵行为 — — 是#MeToo时代的理想戏剧。 也许正因如此，奥地利女剧场导演林迪·休谟（Lindy Hume）下个月将携自己所改编的《弄臣》在西雅图上演。 和《弄臣》戏剧中一样，当今世界，男性继续掌握着巨大的权力，并且常常用来阻止妇女得到更多权力。 但是，从政治舞台上的妇女人数的迅速增加看 — — 并且她们中间包括了法西斯主义者、自由主义者、绿党和社会主义者 — — 男性主宰的日子已经屈指可数。 毫不奇怪，我们正在目睹特朗普之类的“大男子主义”的强烈反对。"

            "Women on Top? What will G-8 summit meetings be like when American President Hillary Clinton and French President Ségolène Royal join German Chancellor Angela Merkel in a formidable triangle of women’s power? The scenario is not altogether unlikely. Indeed, in the United States and France, there are even alternative female candidates for the presidency (Condoleezza Rice in America, Michelle Alliot-Marie in France). Will this mean a new style of both domestic politics and international relations? The answer is not obvious. After all, some women have long had the strength and the will to make it to the top. Think of Indira Gandhi, Golda Meir, or Margaret Thatcher. All three were powerful prime ministers of their countries, though perhaps not the epitome of what might be regarded as feminine values. They all outdid men at their own game and had little time for what came to be called feminism. Indeed, another trend may be more significant as far as political leadership is concerned. When it comes to the formation of governments, women have managed to break out of the prison of their traditional domains, such as education and social affairs. Foreign policy in particular has become a female aspiration. Both the US and the European Union have women leading their foreign offices; so do half a dozen EU countries, including Britain. Has this changed the style, indeed, the substance of foreign policy? Undoubtedly, a shift in policy styles is occurring in many parts of the world. In a word, it appears that the Reagan-Thatcher period is over. While opponents of globalization still fight “neo-liberal” policies, political discourse has taken a new turn. Words like “justice” are back in fashion; there is concern about globalization’s losers and the “underclass.” Likewise, the leader of Britain’s Conservatives, David Cameron, startled more old-fashioned supporters of his party by saying that people released from prison “need, above all, love.” When Prime Minister Tony Blair described the next election as a fistfight in which the “flyweight” Cameron would be carried out and the “heavyweight” Brown victorious after a short bout, he got much applause from his supporters in the House of Commons, but the remark went down badly with voters. Somehow, people prefer “softer” values than were prevalent in the last two decades. Yet it is not the leading women who above all represent these values. Merkel may have been softened by having to preside over a grand coalition, but her original stance was more of the Reagan-Thatcher variety. Yuliya Tymoshenko was clearly the most stouthearted among the leaders of Ukraine’s Orange Revolution, and no one has ever described Hillary Clinton as particularly “soft.” On the contrary, her possible Republican opponent in 2009, Senator John McCain, while a war hero, is also a man who represents to many Americans the new soft values. Merkel had a difficult time in the run-up to her recent party conference, because Jürgen Rüttgers, the minister-president of the largest German state, North-Rhine Westphalia, reminded the Christian Democrats of their historical support for strong social-welfare policies. Only Royal may be said to represent softer lines against the hard-liner of the governing party, Nicolas Sarkozy. So, have women at or near the top made no real difference to politics? Whatever change they have brought has not been obvious. In a sense, women’s advance is simply the normal consequence of the gradual move to effective equality of opportunity that began in the 1960’s. It took decades to become real, and there are still countries that have a long way to go. Despite Tymoshenko’s leading role in Ukraine, it would be surprising to see Russian President Vladimir Putin replaced by a woman, and, while there is a female vice-president in China, there is no sign of a woman becoming Japanese prime minister soon. Even so, in many parts of the world, women have made considerable headway on the path to the top. Not infrequently this has been helped by explicit policies. David Cameron prides himself on a successful campaign to make 40% of all Conservative parliamentary candidates in Britain are women. But this is precisely the point. It is not the women at the top who have changed the scene. Rather, it is a more general trend, helped along by open-minded leaders of both sexes, that has changed the political climate in countries. No one, man or woman, can today aspire to setting the tone of public discourse without recognizing that politics is no longer only a man’s game. In other words, normalization by equal opportunity is itself the change. Whatever the particular values of leading candidates, this is undoubtedly progress.",
            "女子掌权? 如果美国总统希拉里·克林顿，法国总统塞格琳·罗雅尔以及德国总理默克尔这样一个令人生畏的女性领导铁三角聚首在八国峰会上会是怎样一种景象？ 这种情况的出现并不是完全不可能的。 事实上，在美国和法国，甚至还有另外一些女性的总统候选人，美国有赖斯，法国有阿里奥马里 。 这会不会意味着国内政治和国际关系的一种新模式呢？ 答案是并不明显。 不管怎样，一些女人早就拥有了实力以及问鼎的意志力，比如英迪拉·甘地，梅厄或者撒切尔夫人。 这三个人都成了她们国家强有力的总理，尽管这也许不能被看作是女权主义价值的一个缩影。 她们在她们各自的竞赛中都战胜了男人，但是却很少有时间去关注所谓的争取女权运动。 毫无疑问，世界上许多地方政治领导的模式正在发生转变。 当政府组建时，妇女已经能够打破其传统领域，例如教育和社会事务的束缚。 特别是，外交已经成为女性的向往。 美国和欧盟都是由妇女来掌管外交；其他众多欧盟国家也是如此，包括英国。 这是否改变了外交的风格，还是外交的实质？ 毫无疑问，在世界许多地方正在发生政策风格的转变。 简单地说，看上去里根-撒切尔的时代已经过去了。 当全球化的反对者还在与“新自由主义”的政策抗争之时，政治演讲的口气已经转向了一个新的方向。 像“公正”这样的词汇有重新成为了时尚；而对于全球化的失败者以及“下层社会”的人也有了更多的关切。 同样地，英国保守党领袖卡梅隆所谓从监狱里释放出来的人“最需要的是爱”的说法震动了他的党内更为古派的支持者。 当布莱尔首相把下一次大选描述为一场拳击比赛 ， “ 轻量级”的卡梅隆会在一个很短的回合后就被“重量级”的布朗轻松击败，他博得了他在下院的支持者巨大的欢呼，然而这种说法并没有被选民所接受。 就某种程度上讲，人们现在比过去二十年来更倾向于“软”价值。 然而并不是那些处于领导地位的女性最主要地代表了这些价值。 默克尔也许在建立一个大联合政府时会有所软化，但是她最初的立场更多地是里根-撒切尔类型的。 季莫申科显然是乌克兰橙色革命的领导人中最勇敢的一位，同样从来没有人把希拉里·克林顿描述为一个特别“软”的人。 恰恰相反，可能在2009年成为她的共和党对手的参议员麦凯恩作为一个战争英雄，在许多美国人眼里却代表了新的软价值。 默克尔在她前一次的党代会上走上前台也是颇费了一番周折，因为德国最大的州北莱茵-威斯特法伦州的州长约尔根·吕特格尔斯提醒基督教民主党注意他们在历史上一贯支持强有力的社会福利政策。 只有罗耶尔相对于执政党的代表萨尔科齐的强硬路线而言可能代表了软的价值。 那么，女性当权真的在政治上没有带来任何变化吗？ 至少这种变化并不明显。 某种程度上讲，女性所取得的进展只不过是二十世纪六十年代慢慢开始形成的给予男性和女性平等机会的运动的一个正常结果。 这个目标花了几十年时间才变成现实，但是依然还有一些国家距离实现这一目标还有很长的道路要走。 尽管季莫申科在乌克兰处于领导角色，但是如果俄罗斯总统普京被一名女性所取代的话那会令人非常惊讶，而尽管中国有一个女性的副总理，但是没有迹象表明日本会很快出现一名女首相。 尽管如此，在世界上许多地方，女性在走向权力顶峰的路上已经取得了巨大的进步。 明确的政策在这其中常常帮了很大的忙。 卡梅隆在一次成功的竞选活动上自豪地称英国40%的保守党议员候选人是女性。 但是这正是问题所在。 并不是处于权力顶峰的女性改变了这一现象。 这更多地是一种整体的趋势，在两种性别的开明的领导人的推动下，改变了许多国家的政治气候。 没有一个人，不管是女性还是男性，今天在寻求公开演讲的基调时会不认识到政治已经不再是单单男人的游戏。 换句话说，平等机会的正常化本身就是一种改变。 不管处于领先地位的候选人代表的是哪一种价值观，这毫无疑问就是一种进步。"

            "Where Women Stand BERKELEY – Despite a deep recession in 2008 and a slow recovery thereafter, the first two decades of the twenty-first century were generally a time of economic progress in most advanced economies. Real (inflation-adjusted) per capita GDP in the OECD grew at a compound annual rate of 1.15% between 2000 and 2018, and employment levels steadily increased, hitting record highs in some countries. But this growing prosperity was not shared evenly. Real average wage growth in this period was markedly slower than it was between 1995 and 2000, and real median wage growth was slower still. Work became less secure, and poverty rates (even after tax and transfer payments) rose. Moreover, gender gaps in employment and wages narrowed but remained large, and women continued to confront unique challenges as workers, consumers, and savers. Consider the track record for women workers. Total employment across 22 advanced economies was at a record high at the beginning of 2020 (before the COVID-19 pandemic.) There were 45 million more jobs in 2018 than there were in 2000, and women held around two-thirds of them. The female labor force participation rate has grown throughout the OECD, with the exception of Norway – where it was already above average – and the United States, where it fell from 60% in 2000 to 57% in 2018. A comparison of female employment trends in Europe and the US indicates that improvements in paid maternity and paternity leave in Europe have spurred higher female labor force participation, whereas gains in female employment in the US have been held back by the absence of such policies in many states. More broadly, rising female labor force participation was driven primarily by an increase in “non-standard” employment arrangements such as part-time and independent work. Both tend to be more family-friendly than full-time employment, but also more precarious, offering lower pay and fewer if any benefits. From 2000 to 2018, female part-time employment increased by 2.3 percentage points, which is larger than both the 0.7-point increase in full-time employment for women and the 2.1-point decrease in full-time employment for men. Although work opportunities expanded throughout the OECD, they stagnated or declined for middle-skill, middle-wage jobs, which is one reason why overall wage stagnation has become such a persistent challenge. Average (mean) real wages grew just 0.7% per year across 22 countries between 2000 and 2018, which was less than half the average annual GDP growth rate (1.6%). And as of 2017, the median wage was just 81-90% of the average wage across the OECD, reflecting uneven wage growth across income groups. From 2000 to 2018, the gender gap in earnings narrowed very slowly, and remains substantial in many advanced economies. The remaining gaps are the result of many factors, including gender differences in the incidence of part-time work and hours worked, and in occupations and senior roles, as well as overt discrimination and implicit biases against women. Still, there is considerable variance across the OECD: in Belgium, women earn 96 cents for every dollar a man earns; in South Korea, that figure falls to 65 cents; and in the US it is 82 cents. No country has achieved gender parity in wages. As consumers, women have experienced mixed results. Like men, they have benefited greatly from a sharp decline in the prices of many discretionary goods and services, including communications, clothing, furnishings, and recreation. The McKinsey Global Institute estimated that, holding all else constant, people could work six fewer weeks per year, on average, and still consume the same amount of goods and services as in 2000. Theoretically, this trend should have been particularly beneficial for working women, most of whom suffer from greater time poverty than men, because women continue to bear a disproportionate share of family-care responsibilities. Unfortunately, these potential consumer benefits were more than offset by the rising costs of housing, health care, and education, which have absorbed 54-107% of the average household’s income gains in Australia, France, the United Kingdom, and the US. Not surprisingly, single mothers – who head 60% of all US households living below the poverty line – were the most adversely affected by these trends. The outlook is also worrying for women as savers. While real mean individual net wealth recovered to pre-crisis levels in many countries by 2018, real median net wealth did not, leaving lower-income groups worse off. According to one recent study, although women’s median net wealth is higher overall than it was two decades ago, a large gender gap remains. In the eurozone, women’s median net wealth is 62% that of men. Moreover, owing to shifts in institutional pension arrangements, guaranteed pensions now cover just ten years of retirement (on average) in the countries studied, even though women at age 65 can expect to live for another 22 years, compared to 19 years for men. Saving for retirement thus weighs more heavily on women than it does on men. And while surveys show that women are more likely than men to save, they are also less likely to invest, thereby losing out on potential returns. As the economic and social conditions facing individuals and households change, so must the social contract between citizens and their governments. The trends identified here suggest a growing need for access to good jobs, essential goods like housing and health care, and adequate retirement income. For women, recent gains in employment opportunities, wages, and family benefits need to be sustained, and persistent gender gaps need to be closed. Of course, the COVID-19 crisis threatens to undermine many of the gains and aggravate many of the challenges documented here. As the advanced economies struggle to respond, the social contracts on which their citizens depend will be rewritten in ways that are difficult to predict. Whatever form they ultimately take, they must not overlook women workers.",
            "妇女所面临的局面 伯克利—尽管遇到过2008年深度衰退及其后的缓慢复苏，但对大部分发达经济体来说，二十一世纪的前二十年总体是一个经济进步的时代。 2000至2018年间，经合组织真实（经通胀调整的）人均GDP平均年复合增长率为1.15 % ， 就业水平稳步提升，一些国家创出新高。 但这一增长繁荣并不平均。 同时期真实平均工资增长显著低于1995-2000年，真实中位工资增长更加缓慢。 工作变得更不安稳，贫困率（即使在税收和转移支付之后）有所上升。 此外，就业和工资的性别差距有所缩小但仍然很大，妇女仍面临着工作、消费、储蓄等方面的独特挑战。 以妇女工作者的记录为例。 2020年初（COVID-19疫情爆发前 ） ， 22个发达经济体的总体就业位于创纪录的高点。 2018年的工作岗位数量比2000年多了4500万个，其中妇女占据了大约三分之二。 经合组织女性劳动力参与率也全面提高 — — 除了挪威，它的这一指标早已高于平均值；以及美国，从2000年的60%下降到2018年的57 % 。 比较欧洲和美国的女性就业趋势，可以看出欧洲带薪产假的改善刺激了更高的女性劳动力参与率，而美国的女性就业因为许多州没有这样的政策而落后。 总体而言，女性劳动力参与率的升高主要原因是“非标准”就业安排增加了，如兼职和独立执业。 两者都比全职就业更有利于家庭，但也比较不太稳定，薪酬耕地，福利（如有）也更少。 2000-2018年间，女性兼职就业增加了2.3个百分点，比女性全职就业增幅（0.7个百分点）和男性全职就业降幅（2.1个百分点）都要高。 尽管整个经合组织的工作机会扩大了，中等技能的中年工作岗位陷入了停滞或减少，这也是总体工资停滞挑战根深蒂固的原因之一。 2000-2018年间，22国平均（均值）真实工资每年只增长0.7 % ， 还不到平均年GDP增长率（1.6 % ） 的一半。 2017年，经合组织中位工资只有平均工资的81-90 % ， 表明不同收入群体之间工资增长的不平均。 2000-2018年，收入的性别差距缩小得十分缓慢，在许多发达经济体，这一差距仍然巨大。 差距依旧的原因是多样的，包括兼职率和工作时长的性别差异、高管岗位的性别差异，以及明显和潜在的性别歧视。 尽管如此，经合组织国家之间差异甚大：比利时妇女的收入达到了男性的96 % ； 韩国只有65 % ， 美国则是82 % 。 没有一个国家达到了男女同酬。 作为消费者，妇女的趋势也是喜忧参半。 和男性一样，她们大大受益于大量可选商品和服务价格的大幅下跌，包括通讯、服装、家具和娱乐。 麦肯锡全球研究所（McKinsey Global Institute）估算，保持其他因素不变，人们平均每年可以少工作六周而仍然保持与2000年相同的商品和服务消费量。 理论上，这一趋势对于职业妇女尤其有利，她们大部分人面临着比男性更缺少时间，因为妇女仍然需要承担绝大部分家庭义务。 不幸的是，这些潜在的消费福利因为家政、医疗和教育成本的升高而被完全抹煞，后三者占去了澳大利亚、法国、英国和美国平均家庭收入的54-107 % 。 毫不奇怪，单亲母亲 — — 她们构成了美国贫困线下家庭的60 % — —是这些趋势的最大受害者。 作为储蓄者的妇女前景也令人担忧。 到2018年，许多国家的真实平均个人净财富都已经恢复到前危机水平，但真实中位净财富还没有，这让低收入群体情况变得更差了。 一项最新研究表明，尽管妇女中位净财富总体而言比二十年前更高了，但仍存在巨大的性别差距。 在欧元区，妇女中位净财富只有男性的62 % 。 此外，由于机构退休金安排的转变，在受研究国家中，有保证的退休金（平均）仅仅覆盖了十年退休生活，而65岁妇女的预期剩余寿命高达22年，男性为19年。 因此，为退休而储蓄对妇女来说比男性更重要。 调查表明，妇女比男性更愿意储蓄，但她们的投资可能性更低，从而失去了潜在回报。 随着个体和家庭所面临的经济和社会条件的改变，公民与政府之间的社会契约也必须跟着改变。 从这方面的趋势看，我们需要更多的优质岗位、住房和医疗等必须商品，以及充足的退休收入。 对妇女而言，最近就业机会、工资和家庭福利等方面的收益需要保持，而根深蒂固的性别差距必须消除。 当然，COVID-19危机有可能会破坏本文所阐述的诸多进步，加剧诸多挑战。 发达经济体正在疲于应付，其公民的社会契约将以某种难以预测的方式重订。 不管最终的结果怎样，新的社会契约都不能忽视职业妇女。"

            "The Fight for Women’s Rights Beyond #MeToo BRIGHTON – For most people, the #MeToo movement has become synonymous with campaigns against sexual harassment. The movement – which went viral in October 2017 – undoubtedly mobilized women and spurred positive change. But its prominence in media coverage and political discussions of sexual harassment has also been problematic, overshadowing activism for women’s rights in other parts of the world that predates the emergence of #MeToo. In many countries, social movements had already been taking on sexual harassment and abuse for decades. Many of them, including campaigns like #MeshBasita in Lebanon, HarassMap in Egypt, and the “Shefarers” in the Philippines, emerged long before the rise of #MeToo, or were overshadowed by it. A new publication by the Institute of Development Studies brings together reports on women’s rights activism in countries including Benin, Burkina Faso, Egypt, India, Lebanon, Pakistan, the Philippines, and Uganda. The authors cover a wide spectrum of experiences, from well-defined and visible collective action to activism that happens behind the scenes in order to safeguard women’s lives. There is evidence that focusing on the #MeToo movement has in some ways impeded the worldwide struggle for women’s rights, particularly in the Global South. Some activists report that #MeToo has exacerbated existing prejudices with ultra‑nationalists and religious extremists vilifying the movement as a malign Western import. They claim either that local women are not interested in such causes, or that sexual harassment has been fabricated by the West to destroy family values. Consider Lebanon. In August 2017, reports Menaal Munshey, when #MeshBasita (“It’s not OK”) was launched on Lebanese social media, the government, private businesses, and NGOs engaged with the campaign. Then #MeToo happened. Subsequently, organizers experienced a backlash, including reactions like, “Why are you guys talking about it?” and, “This is an American thing, a European thing.” Laws against sexual harassment do exist in many of these places. But much of the legislation is dysfunctional, with women still not getting the accountability and justice they deserve. In Pakistan, for example, every workplace is now required to establish sexual-harassment inquiry procedures, including a committee to hear complaints. But research among female Pakistani politicians reveals that despite the legislation and the existence of Pakistan’s own #MeToo movement, #MainBhi, these requirements have yet to be implemented in their own workplaces (including national and provincial assemblies, local government, and political parties). And the struggle for women’s rights is not confined to physical spaces. In the past few years, online abuse has increased rapidly. This can take many forms, including “revenge porn” (sharing real or photoshopped nude or intimate images of women without their permission, for blackmail or shaming purposes). People worldwide now own smartphones and can capture, alter, and put these types of images online in minutes. Shame and embarrassment frequently stop women and girls from reporting crimes against them, even when they are protected by existing laws. Women in all countries share these feelings, but the situation is particularly severe for women marginalized by extreme inequality and subject to norms and values that hold them responsible for anything that can tarnish their reputation. Many never speak up, terrified of being blamed by others and ostracized by their families. Clearly, #MeToo doesn’t begin to capture the story of how women and men in diverse contexts mobilize against sexual harassment. Yes, collective action against sexual harassment did coalesce around the #MeToo campaign, and in some places it has undoubtedly energized existing movements. But if it hadn’t happened in the West, earlier campaigns in other countries – whether Egypt, India, or South Africa – might have been the spark that inspired solidarity. It is important to recognize diverse global movements and campaigns for women’s rights and to see them as sources of knowledge and inspiration. Learning from the hard-won successes of women’s rights activists worldwide can aid us in understanding and overcoming the obstacles women and men everywhere face in their struggle to address sexual harassment. It would of course be counterproductive to pit voices and perspectives from the Global South against those from the West. Instead, the goal should be to amplify voices, experiences, and insights from around the world to create learning opportunities and, ultimately, to establish the conditions for greater cooperation. Sexual harassment and abuse problems are universal problems. Only through global solidarity can we hope to overcome them.",
            "超越#MeToo的女权斗争 布莱顿—多大多数人来说 ， # MeToo运动已成为反性骚扰的同义词。 这场运动在2017年10月兴起，毫无疑问，它动员了广大妇女，刺激了积极变化。 但它在关于性骚扰的媒体报道和政治讨论的主导地位也很有问题，不利于在#MeToo运动出现之前便已存在的其他女权积极主义。 在许多国家，反对性骚扰和性虐待的社会运动已经存在了几十年。 其中许多运动，如黎巴嫩的#MeshBasita，埃及的HarassMap，以及菲律宾的“Shefarers ” ， 出现的时间远早于#MeToo，都因为#MeToo而暗淡无光。 发展研究所（Institute of Development Studies）的最新发布集合了包括贝宁、布基纳法索、埃及、印度、黎巴嫩、巴基斯坦、菲律宾和乌干达等国家在内的女权积极主义报告。 作者们拥有广泛的经验背景，既有定义明确的活跃的集体行动、也有为了保护妇女生命而退居幕后的积极主义。 有证据表明，专注于#MeToo运动在某种程度上阻碍了世界女权斗争，特别是在全球南方。 一些活动家报告 ， # MeToo加剧了现有偏见，激进民族主义者和宗教极端分子将该运动视为邪恶的西方势力入侵。 他们要么宣称本地妇女对这些运动不感兴趣，要么说性骚扰是西方编造出来用于摧毁家庭价值观的阴谋。 以黎巴嫩为例。 2017年8月，米纳尔·芒西（Menaal Munshey）报道说，当#MeshBasita （ “ 这并不好 ” ） 在黎巴嫩社交媒体上发起时，政府、私人企业和非政府组织都加入其中。 接着出现了#MeToo。 随后，组织者遇到了反攻，包括注入“为什么你们要谈论这些 ？ ” 以及“这是美国的东西，欧洲的东西 。 ” 在许多这些地区，反性骚扰法律确实是存在的。 但大部分形同虚设，妇女仍旧无法得到应有的问责和公正。 比如，在巴基斯坦，所有工作场所都必须制定性骚扰调查流程，包括一个处理投诉的委员会。 但对巴基斯坦女政客的研究表明，虽然有立法，并且巴基斯坦也有自己的#MeToo运动 — — #MainBhi，但这些要求在政客自己的工作场所也没有落实（包括国家和省级国民大会、地方政府和各政党 ） 。 而女权斗争也不局限于政治领域。 在过去几年中，在线攻击日益猖獗。 这种攻击形式众多，包括“泄恨不雅照 ” （ 出于敲诈或羞辱目的分享未经允许的真实或修图的不雅照片 ） 。 如今，世界各地的人们都有智能手机，只要耗费几分钟时间便可以抓取和修改这类图片并发布上网。 羞辱和骚扰常常会阻止妇女和女童报警，尽管她们受到现行法律的保护。 所有国家的妇女都有这样的感觉，而因为极端不平等被边缘化以及受制于女性污名化和有罪论范式和价值观的妇女处境尤其凶险。 许多人从未发声，害怕受到其他人的谴责并被家庭驱逐。 显然 ， # MeToo并没有开始收到各种环境下妇女和男性动员起来反对性骚扰的效果。 诚然 ， # MeToo运动周围确实出现了反性骚扰集体行动，在一些地方 ， # MeToo也确实刺激了现有运动。 但西方不出现#MeToo，其他国家 — — 不管是埃及、印度还是南非 — — 早先的运动可能已成燎原之势。 一个要点是要承认多样化的全球运动和妇女权利运动，将它们视为知识和志趣之源。 从全世界来之不易的妇女权利活动家的成功中汲取经验能够帮助我们理解和克服各地妇女和男性在反性骚扰斗争中所遇到的障碍。 当然，将全球南方的声音和视角与西方对立起来只能适得其反。 相反，目标应该是放大来自全世界的声音、经验和洞见，创造学习机会，最终为更大的合作奠定基础。 性骚扰和性虐待问题是普遍性问题。 只有通过全球团结才能克服。"

            "What Boosts Gender Equality in Developing Countries? WASHINGTON, DC – On March 8, the world will celebrate International Women’s Day, an annual opportunity to recommit to gender equality. This year’s observance comes at an important time for women’s rights, as global movements like #MeToo and #TimesUp are refocusing attention on the discriminatory practices that women confront in their social and professional lives. But while women in the developed world are waging big battles over gender bias, women and girls in developing countries remain focused on smaller victories. On this International Women’s Day, we must not forget that in the world’s poorest communities, poverty, hunger, domestic violence, and discrimination remain endemic obstacles to gender parity. I have studied gender and development in the Global South for 15 years. My research, which has included thousands of interviews with women from India to Burkina Faso, has centered on one question: How can the international community improve the welfare of the world’s poorest women? The answer, it turns out, is to help them do what they are already doing on their own. One of the most effective ways to empower women anywhere, but especially in the developing world, is by promoting financial independence. In many areas, that means supporting “informal savings groups,” networks of like-minded women who pay dues to build a shared pool of resources. This money can then be drawn on to fund any number of items, such as small business expenses, school fees, or health-care costs. Community-based savings groups – there are millions in Asia and Africa alone – are changing lives every day. I once met a woman in Burkina Faso whose son owes his life to the financial resources of a savings network. One evening, when the boy was violently ill with diarrhea, his mother called a taxi to take him to the nearest clinic. But taxis, like ambulances, must be paid for in advance, and the woman had no money. Fortunately, a neighbor who belonged to a health savings group was able to contribute and pay the fare. That immediate access to cash very likely saved the boy’s life. Most savings group loans are similarly small. In Benin, for example, the average loan size in one group is just $9. But, in a country where the average annual income is less than $800, small amounts can make a huge difference. Unfortunately, many savings groups, as important as they are, do not scale; most operate in isolation from official services, which weakens their effectiveness. Women in poor communities must rely on one another, but they also need access to government and international agencies if they are ever to escape from hunger and poverty. That is why my organization, the Grameen Foundation, is using digital technology and mobile phones to connect savings groups with other service providers. One of our largest projects is in Burkina Faso, a desperately poor country in West Africa where an estimated 55% of the population is food insecure for at least a portion of the year. Since 1993, we have worked with more than 73,000 women in nearly 3,300 savings groups, bringing services directly to the women who need them. Our average participant is 40 years old, illiterate, and earns just $7 a week selling crops like sesame and peanut. When we began the program, only about half of the women we worked with said they felt empowered in their homes; many feared their husbands. Today, those sentiments are slowly changing. By serving as a bridge between informal savings groups and banks, health centers, schools, and agricultural extension services, we are helping women make better decisions about food use, nutritional practices, and spending. Our goal is to reduce poverty rates by strengthening asset-management skills, which would give women a greater voice in their communities. “Gender dialogue sessions” that we host are also strengthening family bonds. During each of my field visits, I have been amazed at how these efforts are affecting women’s lives. On one recent trip, I met Rasmata, a young mother who told me that thanks to the safety net of her savings group, she was managing to support her family despite her husband’s emigration abroad, her father’s recent death, and a lingering drought. She was diversifying her income, managing her finances, and even adopting climate-smart farming techniques. The best part was that she described herself as a “hard-working, respectful, rigorous, and ambitious woman.” Those are adjectives that women everywhere, regardless of their financial situation or education, deserve to ascribe to themselves. So this week, as the world celebrates the incredible progress that women have made on the long march to parity, I will be thinking about women like Rasmata, who have accomplished so much despite having so little.",
            "什么促进了发展中国家的性别平等？ 华盛顿—3月8日，世界将迎来国际妇女节，这个节日是一年一度的重振性别平等的机会。 今年的三八妇女节正逢妇女权利的重要时刻 ， “ 我也是 ” （ #MeToo）和“抓紧时间 ” （ #TimesUp）等全球运动正在让人们的注意力重新集中于妇女在社会和职场生活中所遇到的歧视型对待上。 但是，尽管发达世界妇女向性别偏见发动了更大规模的进攻，但发展中国家的妇女和女童仍然着眼于小胜利。 在这个国际妇女节，我们切不可忘记在全球最贫穷的社会里，贫困、饥饿、家庭暴力和歧视仍是阻碍性别平等的巨大障碍。 我在全球南方研究性别和发展问题有15年之久。 在研究过程中，我访问过来自从印度到布基纳法索的数千名妇女，主要话题集中在一个问题上：国际社会如何改善世界最贫穷妇女的福利？ 答案是帮助她们从事她们自己已经在做的事。 不论在什么地区（尤其是发展中世界 ） ， 妇女赋权最有效的方法之一是促进财务独立。 在很多地区，这意味着支持“非正式储蓄组织 ” ， 即由意气相投的妇女组成一个网络，共同出资形成一个共享资源池。 这笔资金可以用来支持一切项目，比如小笔商务支出、学费、医药费等。 基于社区的储蓄组织 — — 光是在亚洲和非洲，这种组织就有数百万之多 — — 正在改变日常生活。 我曾经在布基纳法索遇见一位妇女，靠储蓄网络的金融资源救了自己儿子的性命。 一天晚上，她的儿子剧烈腹泻，她叫了一辆出租车把他送到最近的诊所。 但出租车和救护车一样，必须先付钱才提供服务，但她没有钱。 幸运的是，一位参加了一个医疗储蓄组织的邻居能够慷慨解囊。 立即能够获得现金很有可能是她的儿子能够活下来的主要原因。 大部分储蓄组织贷款都是类似的小额贷款。 比如，在贝宁，一个组织的平均贷款规模只有9美元。 但贝宁平均年收入不到800美元，一小笔钱就可以造成巨大的不同。 不幸的是，许多储蓄组织尽管十分重要，却没有实现规模；大部分此类组织脱离官方服务运转，这削弱了它们的效果。 贫穷社会的妇女必须“抱团取暖 ” ， 但要摆脱饥饿和贫困，她们还需要政府和国际机构的帮助。 因此，我的组织格雷米恩基金会（Grameen Foundation）运用数字技术和移动电话将储蓄组织和其他服务提供者联系在一起。 我们最大的项目之一在布基纳法索。 这是一个位于西非的极端贫穷国家，大约55%的人口一年总有一段时间口粮得不到保证。 自1993年以来，我们与近3,300个储蓄组织的73,000多位妇女进行了合作，为需要它们的妇女直接提供服务。 总体而言，我们的参与者平均年龄为40岁，文化程度为文盲，依靠出售芝麻和花生等农作物为生，每周只能挣7美元。 项目启动时，只有大约一半的参与妇女说感到在家里有得到赋权的感觉；许多人都害怕自己的丈夫。 如今，这些情绪正在慢慢改变。 我们充当了一座连接非正式储蓄组织与银行、医疗中心、学校和农技服务之间的桥梁，帮助妇女做出有关粮食使用、营养和支出的更好的决策。 我们的目标是通过加强资产管理技能让妇女在社区中发出更响亮的声音，从而降低贫困率。 我们主办的“性别对话大会”还加强了家庭关系。 在每一次实地访问中，我都会对这些措施如何影响妇女生活感到高兴。 在一次最近的访问中，我遇到了一位名叫拉斯马塔（Rasmata）的年轻母亲，他告诉我，在她的储蓄组织所提供的安全网的支持下，她得以在丈夫移居海外、父亲去世、干旱持续不退的情况下养活全家。 她正在设法实现收入多样化，进行财务管理，甚至用上了气候智能农作技术。 最令人欣喜的是，她自我定位为一个“努力工作、有礼貌、严格、有进取心的妇女 ” 。 不管身居何处、财务状况和教育程度如何，所有妇女都应该这样自我定位。 因此，在本周全世界庆祝妇女在通往平等的漫漫征途上所取得的巨大进步时，我会想到像拉斯马塔这样的妇女，她们几乎一无所有，但取得了如此不凡的成就。"

            "Climate Leadership Needs More Women FREETOWN – “The higher you go; the fewer women there are.” This observation by the Nobel Peace Prize laureate and environmental trailblazer Wangari Maathai, reflects a reality familiar to all women who have aspired to leadership positions, and it has gained a new meaning for me as the climate crisis has intensified. Though it is already clear that women and girls will face higher risks and greater burdens because of climate change, they remain significantly underrepresented in climate and environmental negotiations. In 2019, the United Nations Gender Composition Report noted that the number of women represented in UN Framework Convention on Climate Change bodies was not in line with efforts to create gender balance. In response, member states adopted a gender action plan at the UN Climate Change Conference (COP25) in 2019. The plan recognized that “full, meaningful, and equal participation and leadership of women in all aspects of the UNFCCC process and in national- and local-level climate policy and action is vital for achieving long-term climate goals.” And yet, by the time COP26 rolled around two years later, little had changed. The United Kingdom’s COP26 presidency was predominantly male-led, and just 11 of the 74 African national representatives were women. Moreover, the UN Convention on Biological Diversity appears to be exhibiting a similar tendency, with male negotiators outnumbering women negotiators by around 60. The failure to ensure equal representation and women’s participation in efforts to tackle climate change and biodiversity loss is short-sighted, at best, and potentially reckless. The problem is also increasingly urgent. Last month, delegates from around the world gathered in Geneva for one of the final rounds of negotiations to conclude the new UN Global Biodiversity Framework. With the aim of accelerating action to halt further species loss and tackle climate change, these gatherings will shape the global response to both crises for years to come. The latest reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change have demonstrated the scale of these crises. The IPCC has documented unequivocally that human activities are warming our planet’s surface, leading to rapidly changing weather systems, biodiversity loss, and increased resource insecurity. By 2100, 50% of Africa’s bird and mammal species could disappear. We are potentially entering a sixth mass extinction, and if the problem is left unchecked, our sources of food, water, and medicine will be increasingly at risk. Women comprise the majority of the world’s poor and are disproportionately affected by these crises. In the developing world, they are overwhelmingly responsible for sourcing food and water for their families, and they often take the lead in fuel collection and household management. Women also make up nearly half of the world’s smallholder farmers, producing 70% of Africa's food. As such, women and girls are often the first to experience the harsh realities of climate change. But, owing to pervasive inequalities that limited their access to education and health care, unequal employment rates, and low rates of representation in public office, they are less likely than men to be able to participate in decision-making processes. If the last two years have shown us anything, it is that women’s leadership is critical in tumultuous times. According to a recent study of 194 countries, the immediate responses to the COVID-19 pandemic were systematically better in countries with women leaders. Similarly, research has found that “female representation leads countries to adopt more stringent climate-change policies,” and that a high degree of female representation in parliament makes it more likely that a country will ratify international environmental treaties. Women bring not just ambition but also different perspectives and experiences to the table. As a result, their contributions ultimately lead to more nuanced and inclusive environmental policies. In Africa, the importance of women’s leadership in the face of climate change and biodiversity loss is evident to anyone who looks. In Nigeria, Minister of State for Environment Sharon Ikeazor has advocated for the High Ambition Coalition for Nature and People and pushed for fossil-fuel subsidies to be replaced by investments in sustainable, low-carbon development. In Rwanda, Minister of Environment Jeanne d’Arc Mujawamariya has won praise for her inclusive rainforest conservation efforts. In Chad, the environmental activist Hindou Oumarou Ibrahim continues to champion Africa’s local communities and indigenous peoples at the highest levels of the UN. And here in Freetown, we are planting one million trees over three rainy seasons to promote climate resilience and green job creation. All these women, including me, have championed “30x30,” the global campaign to protect 30% of the world’s surface by 2030. Meeting this objective would prevent further ecosystem destruction, and the effort could lead to the first-ever global agreement to halt the destruction of nature. Many more women are tackling biodiversity loss and climate change, including indigenous women who are using their unique knowledge of the land to farm more sustainably and protect fragile ecosystems, and aspiring politicians running on integrated policy platforms linking reproductive health, education, and environmental protection. Those who are already in leadership positions must ensure that these women are given a chance to contribute. Much has changed since 2004, when Maathai won the Nobel Peace Prize for her contributions to sustainable development, democracy, and peace. Emissions have surged, and extreme weather events have increased in frequency and intensity. But much has also stayed the same: women continue to be excluded from leadership positions, and the world continues to pay the price for it. As the final negotiations for the new Global Biodiversity Framework continue, and as we approach this year’s UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD COP15) in Kunming, China, we have a duty to address these failures. If we don’t bring more women to the table, a climate disaster is almost certainly guaranteed.",
            "气候领导层需要更多女性 弗里敦 — “ 职位越高；女性越少 。 ” 诺贝尔和平奖得主兼环境开拓者旺加里·马塔伊这项观察所得出的结论反应了所有渴望担任领导职务的女性们都熟悉的现实，而随着气候危机的不断加剧，这对我而言已经有了新的意义。 尽管妇女和女童将因气候变化而面临更高风险和更大负担的现实已经显而易见，但在气候和环境谈判中，她们所享有的代表性依然严重不足。 2019年，联合国性别构成报告指出，联合国气候变化框架公约（UNFCC）中的女性代表人数严重不符合创造性别平衡的努力。 作为回应，一项性别行动计划由各成员国在2019年联合国气候变化框架公约第25次缔约大会上（COP25）通过。 该计划承认“女性充分、有意义且平等参与并领导联合国气候变化框架公约进程的方方面面及国家和地方层面的气候政策和行动对实现长期气候目标有着至关重要的意义 。 ” 但当联合国气候变化框架公约第26次缔约方大会在两年后召开时，情况几乎没有发生任何变化。 由英国为主席国的第26次缔约方大会仍主要由男性所主导，而74名非洲国家代表中仅有11位女性。 此外，联合国生物多样性公约似乎也表现出同样的趋势，男性谈判代表比女性谈判代表多60人左右。 未能确保平等代表和女性参与应对气候变化及生物多样性丧失的工作可能是一种冒险，充其量也极为短视。 而且问题也越来越迫切。 上个月，来自世界各地的代表齐聚日内瓦，参与确定全新联合国全球生物多样性框架公约最后轮次的谈判。 为加速行动以阻止进一步物种丧失并应对气候变化，上述会议将决定未来几年人类对两大危机所采取的全球策略。 政府间气候变化专门委员会所发表的最新报告显示了上述危机的影响范围。 政府间气候变化专门委员会明确记录了人类活动正在导致地球表面变暖，引发天气系统快速变化、生物多样性丧失以及资源不安全加剧。 截止2100年，50%的非洲鸟类和哺乳动物物种均可能消失。 我们很有可能正在进入第6次大灭绝，而且，如果对问题未能加以控制，我们的食物、水和药物来源将面临越来越大的威胁。 女性构成了世界穷人的绝大多数，而且，她们受到上述危机的影响不成比例。 在发展中国家，她们主要负责为家人采集食物和水，而且往往主导燃料收集和家庭管理。 女性还占到全球小农户数的近一半，生产了非洲70%的粮食。 因此，妇女和女童往往最先体验到气候变化所带来的严酷现实。 但由于普遍不平等限制了她们获得教育和医疗的机会、就业率不平等和公职代表率极低，导致与男性相比，她们参与决策过程的可能性更低。 如果说过去两年教会了我们任何经验教训，那就是，在动荡时期能发挥关键作用的往往是女性领导力。 最近对194个国家的研究结果显示，由女性领导的国家其对2019年新冠疫情的直接反应普遍更加优越。 同样，研究发现 ， “ 女性代表引导国家采取更严格的气候变化政策 ， ” 而女性在议会中的代表程度更高导致相关国家更有可能批准国际环境公约。 女性谈判者所带来的不仅仅是雄心壮志，还有不同的视角和经历。 因此，她们参与意见最终会导致更细致入微、也更具包容性的环境政策。 在非洲，面对气候变化和生物多样性的丧失，女性领导力的重要性对任何人而言都是显而易见的。 在尼日利亚，环境国务部长沙龙·伊凯佐一直倡导建立雄心勃勃的自然和人类联盟，并推动以可持续、低碳发展投资取代化石燃料补贴的政策。 在卢旺达，环境部长珍妮·德阿尔克·穆贾瓦玛利亚因其包容性雨林保护工作而备受赞誉。 在乍得，环境活动人士欣杜·乌马鲁·易朴拉欣继续在联合国最高层级支持非洲当地群体和土著民众。 这里，也就是我所在的弗里敦，我们在三个雨季时间里种植了100万棵树，以提高气候适应性并创造绿色就业岗位。 所有这些女性，包括我在内，都倡导截止2030年保护30%地表面积的“30x30”全球运动。 实现该目标将防止进一步生态系统破坏，而且这项工作可能导致有史以来首个停止破坏自然全球协议的达成。 包括土著妇女在内的越来越多女性正在应对生物多样性丧失和气候变化，她们正运用自己独特的土地知识提高耕作方式的可持续性并保护脆弱的生态系统，并激励政治家倡导综合性政策平台，将生殖健康、教育和环境保护联系在一起。 那些已经占据领导岗位的人必须确保这些女性有机会作出贡献。 自2004年马塔伊因对可持续发展民主及和平所作出的贡献而荣获诺贝尔和平奖以来，情况已经发生了很大变化。 不但排放量激增、而且极端天气事件的频率和强度增加。 但又有很多事情从未发生改变：女性仍然被排除在领导岗位之外，而且世界将继续为此付出代价。 随着新全球生物多样性框架最后阶段谈判的进行，同时随着今年在中国昆明召开的联合国生物多样性公约会议（CBD COP15）的不断临近，我们有责任解决这些问题。 如果不让更多女性参与进来，那么一场气候灾难几乎是注定要发生的。"

            "How Women Can Break the Bias MONROVIA – Since 1911, societies around the world have dedicated days, months, and even decades (in Africa’s case) to celebrating women’s achievements and promoting solutions to new and persistent challenges. But over the past two years, the COVID-19 pandemic has expanded the plight of women to outsize proportions, sharply highlighting the urgency of this year’s International Women’s Day theme: “Break the Bias.” The onus is on us, the world’s women, to fulfill this charge. Relying on our own ingenuity, we must shift our focus, refresh our global discourse, and usher in a new era for women’s leadership. There is no doubt that women have borne the brunt of the pandemic’s costs. Many were forced to shelter from a silent enemy that we now know to be less lethal than their own closest kin. Many women were victims of what UN Women calls the “shadow pandemic,” suffering beatings, rape, insults, and psychological trauma in what should have been a safe haven from a biological scourge. Among the more staggering statistics from this period is one documenting the number of women who didn’t suffer or witness domestic violence: one in ten. You read that right: In Liberia, just one in ten survey respondents reported not witnessing sexual or gender-based violence, and only two in ten reported not experiencing it, during the COVID lockdown. There is a clear inverse correlation between education and susceptibility to sexual and gender-based violence. Less-educated cohorts are generally more vulnerable, because they tend to have low economic and political agency and scant access to the health systems that could detect and address risks. These women suffer alone but together, listening to each other’s cries through windows and walls. Despite the structural disadvantages we face, women have risen to the occasion. In government, we have swiftly established unpopular but undoubtedly effective measures to curb the spread of COVID-19. New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern is but one of the many women leaders stretching the bounds of ingenuity and determination to save lives. From Ethiopia, Germany, and Slovakia to Denmark, Namibia, and Finland, the world’s 21 women heads of state and government serving when the pandemic erupted led the charge against it with transparency and integrity, outstripping their male counterparts with effective public-health policies. Health systems, too, benefited from women’s leadership. Liberia’s director-general of the General Services Agency, Mary Broh, has shown unshakeable tenacity, setting up web-based tracking tools to take stock of COVID-19 cases, treatments, vaccinations, and supplies, and running a city-wide cleanup drive in Monrovia ahead of the country’s bicentennial celebrations. Liberian women broke protocols and traditions to save lives, bridging the gaps between time-honored systems and the needs of the moment. While others were focused solely on the pandemic, women leaders took the initiative to set up maternal centers at COVID-19 points of care, minimizing infant mortality. They also enlisted religious communities’ support to establish testing centers, widening the net of outbreak control points. Throughout the pandemic, women have shattered the myth that strategies based on compassion and consensus-building are weak and ineffectual. Adaptable and sensitive to the demands of the moment, women leaders have used these qualities to build unity and support for lifesaving behaviors. Rather than being defeated by the double standards held against us, women leaders have remained humble, diligent, and collegial. But above all, they have been consistent and decisive. Moreover, we have been learning from our experiences to assess accurately the uneven social and political terrain on which we operate, so that we can approach our conditions more strategically. In addition to sharpening our awareness of the difference between pandemic and endemic, COVID-19 and flu, we have also directed more attention to sexual and gender-based violence. This problem has long been considered endemic – a cyclical scourge flowing from the honeymoon to the hospital. We should now treat it the same way we do a virus. That means isolating perpetrators and bringing them to justice, establishing systems to detect and address cases, and engaging with communities to stop the spread. We must devise curative and preventive measures that include men and boys, so that a lasting cultural transformation occurs. The post-pandemic road ahead is long. Navigating it demands women’s perseverance and strategic acumen. We must target and reform the justice and social systems that have left women to the wolves, and we must harness the indirect, outsize force that politically and economically empowered women can bring to bear against violence. We must crowd legislatures and government offices with women, creating a critical mass that can shift the paradigm on justice, peace, security, and health. Breaking the bias may not lead to an immediate ceasefire in domestic settings. But with more women leading at every level and in every sector, we will gradually increase our collective access to education, gainful employment, and all the other resources needed to help women escape violence. If you are a woman reading this, we challenge you to consider pursuing a public leadership role, starting in your own community. We dare you, and we believe in you. The world is yours to win.",
            "妇女如何打破偏见 蒙罗维亚—1911 年以来，世界各地的社会花费了数天、数月甚至数十年（如非洲）来庆祝妇女的成就，推动解决新的和持续存在的挑战。 但在过去两年中，新冠大流行大大放大了女性的困境，突显出今年国际妇女节主题 “打破偏见”的紧迫性。 我们，全世界的女性，有责任履行这一职责。 我们必须依靠自身的聪明才智，转移注意力，刷新全球话语权，开创女性领导力的新时代。 毫无疑问，女性首当其冲地承受了这场大流行的代价。 许多人被迫躲避一个沉默的敌人，而现在我们知道，这个敌人的杀伤力不如她们最亲近的人。 许多妇女是联合国妇女署所谓的“影子疫情”的受害者，妇女在本应远离生物灾难避风港遭受殴打、强奸、侮辱和心理创伤。 这一时期最惊人的统计数据之一是没有遭受或目睹家庭暴力的女性人数：十分之一。 你没看错：在利比里亚，只有十分之一的受访者报告说没有目睹性或性别暴力，只有十分之二的人报告说在新冠封锁期间没有经历过性或性别暴力。 教育与对性和性别暴力的易感性之间存在明显的负相关。 受教育程度较低的人群通常更容易受到伤害，因为他们往往缺乏经济和政治能力，也很少能够接触可以检测和解决风险的卫生系统。 这些妇女既独自受苦，也集体遭难，隔着窗户和墙壁倾听彼此的哭声。 尽管我们面临结构性劣势，但妇女已经迎难而上。 在政府中，我们迅速制定了不受欢迎但无疑是有效的措施来遏制 新冠的传播。 新西兰总理阿德恩是众多展现智慧和拯救生命决心的女性领导人之一。 从埃塞俄比亚、德国和斯洛伐克到丹麦、纳米比亚和芬兰，全球 21 位在大流行爆发时任职的女性国家元首和政府首脑以透明和正直的态度领导了抗疫，以有效的公共卫生政策不让须眉。 卫生系统也受益于女性的领导。 利比里亚总务署署长玛丽·布罗（Mary Broh）表现出不可动摇的坚韧，建立了基于网络的跟踪工具来盘点 新冠 病例、治疗、疫苗接种和供给，并在蒙罗维亚全市范围内开展清扫运动迎接国家两百周年庆典。 利比里亚妇女打破教条和传统拯救生命，跨越历史悠久的制度与当下的需要之间的鸿沟。 当其他人只关注大流行时，女性领导人主动在新冠 护理点建立母婴中心，最大限度地降低婴儿死亡率。 她们还争取宗教界的支持，建立检测中心，扩大疫情控制点网络。 在整个大流行期间，女性打破了一个神话，即基于同情和建立共识的战略是软弱和无效的。 女性领导人表现出对当下的需求的适应力和敏感性，女性领导者利用这些品质构建凝聚力，支持拯救生命的行为。 女性领导人没有被不利于我们的双重标准所击败，而是保持谦虚、勤奋和合议。 但最重要的是，她们始终如一且果断。 此外，我们一直在从我们的经验中学习，以准确评估我们所处的不平衡的社会和政治领域，从而更加策略性地处理我们的条件。 除了提高我们对流行病和地方病、新冠和流感之间的区别的认识之外，我们还更加关注性和性别暴力。 这个问题长期以来一直被认为是地方病 — — 从蜜月到医院的周期性祸害。 我们现在应该像对待病毒一样对待它。 这意味着隔离肇事者并将他们绳之以法，建立发现和处理案件的系统，并与社区合作以阻止传播。 我们必须制定包括男性和男孩在内的治疗和预防措施，促进持久的文化转变。 疫情后的路还很长。 驾驭它需要女性的毅力和战略敏锐度。 我们必须瞄准和改革那些让女性陷入困境的司法和社会制度，我们必须利用在政治和经济上赋权的女性可以用来对抗暴力的间接而巨大的力量。 我们必须在立法机构和政府办公室中大量增加女性，形成可以改变正义、和平、安全和健康范式的临界量。 打破偏见可能不会导致国内环境立即熄火。 但随着越来越多的女性在各个层面和各个部门发挥领导作用，我们将逐步增加我们集体获得教育、带薪就业以及帮助女性摆脱暴力所需的所有其他资源的机会。 如果你是阅读本文的女性，我们要求你考虑追求公共领导角色，就从你自己的社区开始。 我们赋予你胆量，我们相信你。 你可以赢得世界。"

            "The Myth of the Women’s Vote WASHINGTON, DC – Among the clichés that deserve to be thrown out after the recent presidential election in the United States is the idea of a “women’s vote.” It may seem surprising that only 54% of the female electorate voted for Hillary Clinton, the first woman nominated for president by a major party. But while gender is a strong marker for how Americans think about certain issues, it is not the best predictor of how they will vote. It turns out that female candidates do not face a single gender gap, but rather multiple gender gaps. To be sure, a superficial look at past election results reveals an enormous and persistent difference between men and women voters overall. According to Pew Research, the last presidential election in which men and women voted the same was the 1976 contest between Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford. In this year’s election, women favored Clinton by 12 percentage points, and men favored Trump by the same margin. Men favored George W. Bush by 11 points in 2000, and women favored Obama by 13 points and 11 points in 2008 and 2012, respectively; but until now we have never seen double-digit gaps in both directions simultaneously. But this still does not mean that the gender gap tells us much as a first-order factor, especially if we consider other gaps among demographic groups. If we sort by race or ethnicity, we find that white Americans favored Trump by 21 points, while Hispanics and African-Americans favored Clinton by 36 points and 80 points, respectively. Meanwhile, voters with different education levels were further apart than in any election since 1980. College-educated voters backed Clinton by a nine-point margin, while people without a college degree backed Trump by an eight-point margin. A New York Times analysis of exit polls found that voters with annual incomes below $50,000 backed Clinton by about a ten-point margin, while voters with incomes above that level split evenly between the two candidates. This indicates that, at least in this year’s election, ethnicity and education were much more predictive than income. As it happens, they were also more predictive than gender. Ninety-three percent of African-American women and 80% of African-American men voted for Clinton. But 53% of white women and 63% of white men voted for Trump, while only 43% of white women and 31% of white men voted for Clinton. Similarly, Clinton won the support of white, college-educated women by six points; but she lost white non-college-educated women by 28 points and white non-college-educated men by 49 points. And if we look just at Republican voters, the gender gap vanishes almost entirely: 91% of Republican women and 92% of Republican men voted for Trump. This all points not to a single gender dynamic, but to one refracted through multiple social and economic lenses. For example, as CBS News noted, Clinton’s failure to match President Barack Obama’s performance with African-American voters was “entirely due to black men” not voting for her – though why this was the case remains unexplained. And, despite her candidacy’s historic significance, Clinton’s performance with white women voters was no better than Obama’s performance in 2012. We know that Republican women voted according to their party affiliation and not their gender. But Trump also seems to have reached white women not affiliated with a political party, perhaps owing to his campaign’s strategy of hyping women’s anxiety. This strategy’s success indicates one way that gender can play a role in voter decision-making. Voter data going back 50 years suggests that women, more than men, are moved by the anxiety of changing circumstances and external threats. For example, in the 1964 presidential election, Lyndon B. Johnson’s campaign aired the now-famous “Daisy” advertisement that suggested that his opponent, Barry Goldwater, would pull the US into a nuclear war; a week later, polls found that 45% of men, but 53% of women, shared that concern. Similarly, George W. Bush performed 30% better with women voters in his 2004 re-election campaign than he did in his 2000 campaign, which many political analysts attribute to anxieties among white middle-class “security moms” in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Still more recently, in the 2014 US midterm elections, Republicans emphasized the US’s vulnerabilities, and aired advertisements hinting that the Islamic State was directing Ebola-infected agents to kill Americans. Experts ridiculed these claims, but polling suggests that the advertisements were nevertheless effective, and a number of Democratic incumbents, and women in particular, lost elections that year. The Democrats’ focus on reproductive rights had done little to sway women who were already worrying about the Islamic State and Ebola. As I warned at the time, the 2014 election was a trial run for a 2016 strategy to defeat a woman candidate. Many political observers assumed that this strategy could not possibly work for a Republican candidate who had suggested that a debate moderator was menstruating, joked about dating his daughter, was caught on tape boasting about groping women, and was publicly accused by several women of sexual harassment and assault. But, just as in the 2014 election, Republican-leaning voters in 2016 were far more concerned about terrorism, crime, illegal immigration, and economic security than they were about issues such as sexism, racism, and inequality. Where does this leave American women? A female US presidential candidate has now won a majority of women’s votes, and more total votes than her male opponent, and yet her strategy failed to deliver enough votes to secure a victory. In America’s polarized political culture, appeals to one group simply alienate other groups. As long as female candidates are forced to meet multiple, contradictory gender expectations, the US will never close the most prominent gap of all: that between America and the many countries that have already chosen a woman to lead them.",
            "女性选票传说 华盛顿—在应该从最近的美国总统大选中消灭的糟粕中，有一个是“女性选票”的概念。 看起来好像很奇怪，只有54%的女选民把票投给了历史上第一位主要政党总统提名人希拉里·克林顿。 然而，尽管性别是美国人看待某些问题的重要标记，但它并非如何投票的最佳指标。 看起来，女候选人面临的不是单一性别差距，而是多重性别差距。 诚然，肤浅地研究过去的选举结果表明，男性和女性选民之间总体而言存在巨大且持久的差异。 据皮尤研究公司（Pew Research ） ， 最近一次男性和女性选民投票结果相同的总统选举时1976年吉米·卡特与杰拉德·福特之间的竞争。 在今年的选举中，女性以12个百分点的优势更支持克林顿，而男性以同样的优势更支持特朗普。 2000年，男性支持小布什的优势为11个百分点，2008年和2012年，女性支持奥巴马的优势分别为13和11个百分点；但到目前为止，我们从未发现两个方向同时出现两位数差距。 但这仍然不意味着性别差距可以作为第一等因素，特别是如果我们考虑人群之间的其他差距的话。 如果我们用种族或民族分类，就会发现美国白人支持特朗普的优势为21个百分点，而西班牙裔和非洲裔美国人支持克林顿的优势分别为36和80个百分点。 与此同时，不同教育水平的选民之间的分歧为1980年以来之最。 具有大学文化的选民以九个百分点的优势支持克林顿，而没有大学文凭的选民支持特朗普的优势为八个百分点。 《纽约时报》的口民调分析发现，年收入50,000美元以下的选民以十个百分点的优势支持克林顿，而年收入50,000美元以上的选民对两位候选人的支持不分伯仲。 这表明，至少在今年的选举中，种族和教育比收入更有预测意义。 是的，它们也比性别更具有预测意义。 百分之九十三的非洲裔女性和80%的非洲裔男性把票投给了克林顿。 但53%的白人女性和63的白人男性支持特朗普，而只有43%的白人女性和31的白人男性把票投给了克林顿。 类似地，克林顿以六个百分点的优势赢得受过大学教育的白人女性的支持，但她在未上过大学的白人女性上输掉了28个百分点，在未上过大学的白人男性上输掉了49个百分点。 而如果我们只看共和党选民，性别差距几乎完全消失：91%的共和党女性和92%的共和党男性把票投给了特朗普。 所有这些都不支持单一的性别动态，而指向多重社会和经济滤镜的深度折射。 比如，CBS新闻台指出，克林顿没有取得奥巴马总统在非洲裔选民中的表现“完全可以归因于黑人男性”没有投票给她 — — 尽管为什么会这样没有得到解释。 此外，尽管她在提名竞争中取得空前大胜，但克林顿在白人女选民中的表现并未优于2012年的奥巴马。 我们知道，共和党女性投票是根据政党属性，而不是性别。 但特朗普似乎也赢得了不属于某个正当的白人女性，也许这是因为他的竞选战略直击女性的焦虑点。 这一战略的成功表明，性别在某种程度上可以影响投票决策。 回溯50年的选民数据表明，女性比男性更受环境变化和外部威胁所带来的焦虑的驱动。 比如，在1964年的总统选举中，林登·约翰逊竞选班子制作了如今大名鼎鼎的“黛西”广告，暗示他的对手巴里·戈德华特（Barry Goldwater）将把美国拖入核战争；一周后，民调显示45%的男性表示感同身受，但女性的这一比例达到了53 % 。 类似地，小布什在2004年的连任选战中的女性选民表现比2000年更好，许多政治分析家将此归因于白人中产阶级“安全妈妈”因为2001年9月11日的恐怖袭击而引起焦虑。 更近一些的2014年美国中期选举中，共和党强调美国的弱点，并制作广告暗示伊斯兰国派出感染埃博拉病毒的特工杀死美国人。 专家对这样的宣传嗤之以鼻，但民调显示这些广告是有效的，而在那一年的选举中，许多民主党在任者 — — 特别是女性 — — 败走麦城。 民主党对生育权的强调几乎无法动摇已经开始担忧伊斯兰国和埃博拉的女性。 当时我警告说，2014年选举是2016年击败女性候选人策略的试验场。 许多政治观察家认为这一策略对于一位表示电视辩论主持人来“大姨妈 ” 、 打趣约会他女儿、吹嘘“咸猪手”被人拍下、被多位女性公开谴责性骚扰的共和党候选人来说根本没有作用。 但是，一如2014年选举，2016年倾向于共和党的选民更加担心的是恐怖主义、犯罪、非法移民和经济安全，而不是性别歧视、种族主义和不平等性等问题。 这对美国女性意味着什么？ 一位女美国总统候选人赢得了多数女性选票，总票数也多于她的男性对手，但她的策略没有吸引足够选票以保证胜利。 在极化的美国政治文化中，吸引一个群体等于疏远其他群体。 美国永远无法填补最显眼的差距：美国和许多已经选择女性来领导他们的许多国家之间差距。"

            "Helping Women Crack the “Export Code” NEW YORK – When I first met the Accra-based fashion designer Chiedza Makonnen in 2014, her sales beyond Ghana were minimal. Yet today, Makonnen’s brand, Afrodesiac Worldwide, is featured on the red carpets of Hollywood and the stages of the Essence Festival in New Orleans. Because Makonnen cracked the “export code,” her company has scaled up production, tripled its staff, and vastly expanded its media profile. Cracking the export code means overcoming the notion that businesses owned and managed by women cannot be global, because meeting the standards required for cross-border trade is too challenging and expensive. It is widely assumed (albeit not stated outright) that women-owned businesses are riskier and therefore less attractive to investors. But just as women 50 years ago burned their bras to destroy a symbol of oppression, women today must remove the barriers preventing them from trading freely in the global economy. To be sure, on this International Women’s Day, women in many countries are better off and enjoy more opportunities than their mothers and grandmothers did, owing to significant improvements in access to education and health care. But major gaps remain, and, given the slow and uneven pace of progress, there is no room for complacency. According to the World Economic Forum, closing the overall gender gap across 106 countries will take 108 years if we continue at the current pace of change; in Sub-Saharan Africa, where the problem is most acute, it will take at least 135 years. And the single largest gap is economic; closing it will take an estimated 202 years. Gender inequality is a truly global problem that persists even in the most gender-equal countries. Still, there are bright spots that can guide others. In Norway, for example, women now hold the three highest government positions (prime minister, finance minister, foreign affairs minister) for the first time in the country’s history. In Rwanda, ministerial positions are perfectly balanced between genders, and 61% of parliamentarians are women. And in Barbados, a woman now serves as prime minister for the first time. Unfortunately, trade and business seem to be lagging behind politics. Despite Norway’s groundbreaking 2007 law requiring that women hold 40% of corporate board seats, women still occupy disproportionately fewer top management positions. Across the Norwegian public and private sectors, fewer than one-quarter of senior executives are women; and in 2017, a mere 15 out of 213 publicly listed companies were run by women. True, Bloomberg’s 2019 Gender-Equality Index of companies in 36 countries suggests that businesses are doing more to ensure that women make it to the C-suite and boardroom. Yet the grim truth is that women remain on the economic fringes in most countries around the world. Women’s economic marginalization is a problem for everyone. According to the World Bank, men’s lifetime earnings are more than $23,000 above those women, on average, implying that $160 trillion in human-capital wealth – the equivalent of two years of global GDP – is simply being left on the table. Including the one billion women who remain on the margins in the formal economy worldwide would be like adding another China and another United States. As I and many other gender-equality advocates have been saying repeatedly in recent years, “You cannot win the match with half the team on the bench.” At the International Trade Center, we are working to enable women to crack the export code and join men as equal players on the global economic playing field. Our research from 25 countries finds that only one in five exporting companies are owned by women, owing to significant gender-based discrimination. With the ITC’s SheTrades Initiative, we hope to connect three million women entrepreneurs to global markets. Makonnen is just one of many women who have already benefited from the program. Others include Sonia Mugabo in Rwanda, whom Forbes Africa has included on its list of promising young entrepreneurs, and Anyango Mpinga, who is now one of Kenya’s leading designers. Success in fashion design is not the only thing these three women have in common. Before signing up to the SheTrades Initiative, they all encountered gender-related barriers when trying to scale up their businesses. But millions of other women entrepreneurs still need to crack the export code. If the barriers they face are not addressed, we will never achieve gender equality within our lifetimes. Enabling women’s full participation in global trade is not just a moral issue. It is also an economic imperative, because thriving export sectors improve competitiveness and create better-paid jobs. And while there is no magic solution, the SheTrades Initiative and similar programs show that it can be done. With the right policies in place, men and women alike will be better off. The first step is to equip women entrepreneurs with the tools, skills, and confidence needed to crack the export code. Once they’ve done that, there is no limit to what they can achieve.",
            "帮助妇女破解“出口密码” 纽约—2014年，我第一次见到阿克拉时装设计师齐扎·马柯南（Chiedza Makonnen）时，她在加纳国外几乎没有市场。 但如今，马柯南的品牌Afrodesiac Worldwide已经走上了好莱坞红地毯和新奥尔良大节日（Essence Festival）等舞台。 由于马柯南解密了“出口密码 ” ， 她的公司产量扩大，人员增加了两倍，媒体报道也大大增加。 解密出口密码意味着克服一个观念 — — 妇女拥有和管理的企业无法成为全球企业，因为满足跨境交易所要求的标准过于困难和昂贵。 人们广泛认为（不过没有直言 ） ， 妇女所有的企业风险更高，因此对投资者吸引力较低。 但正如50年前的妇女烧掉胸罩以示摧毁压迫象征，今天的妇女也必须消除阻止她们在全球经济中自由交易的壁垒。 平心而论，在这个国际妇女节，许多国家的妇女都能够比她们的母亲和祖母享受到更多的机会，境遇也有所改善，这是教育和医疗普及的大幅改善所带来的。 但仍然存在巨大的差距，进步缓慢由不一，我们绝无理由自满。 据世界经济论坛，按当前变化速度计算，填补106个国家的总体性别差距需要108年时间；在问题最为突出的撒哈拉以南非洲，至少需要135年时间。 而最大的差距是经济差距，填补这个差距预计需要202年时间。 性别不平等是一个真正的全球问题，哪怕在性别最平等的国家，这一问题也存在。 尽管如此，一些闪光点可以成为其他人的指引。 比如，在挪威，妇女在历史上第一次占据三个政府最高岗位（首相、财政部长、外交部长 ） 。 在卢旺达，部长岗位实现了完美性别平衡，61%的议会议员为妇女。 在巴巴多斯，历史上第一次有妇女成为总理。 不幸的是，贸易和商业似乎落后于政治。 尽管挪威在2007年实现了立法突破，要求公司董事会岗位必须有40%为女性，但跻身最高管理岗位的妇女人数仍然非常少。 在挪威公共和私营部门，只有不到四分之一的高官为妇女；2017年，213家上市公司中只有15家为妇女领导。 诚然，2019年彭博（Bloomberg）公司性别平等指数表明，36个国家的妇女跻身首席职位和董事会。 但惨淡的现实是，妇女在全球大部分国家仍处于边缘地位。 妇女经济边缘化是一个影响到所有人的问题。 据世界银行，平均而言男性终身收入比妇女高23,000美元以上，这意味着160万亿美元人力资本财富 — — 相当于两年的全球GDP — — 没有流向应该得到的人。 再加上全球还有十亿妇女仍徘徊在正式经济的边缘，等于世界浪费了一个中国外加一个美国。 我和其他性别平等活动家在近几年中一直指出 ， “ 放着一半队员不用，你无法赢得比赛 。 ” 在国际贸易中心（International Trade Center ） ， 我们致力于赋能妇女解密出口密码，与男性一起成为全球经济竞技场的平等选手。 我们的来自25个国家的研究发现，拜严重的性别歧视所赐，只有五分之一的出口公司为妇女所有。 国际贸易中心推出了她贸易计划（SheTrades Initiative ） ， 希望让三百万女性企业家进入全球市场。 马柯南只是从该项目中获益的众多妇女之一。 其他人包括卢旺达的索尼娅·穆加博（Sonia Mugabo）和安严格·姆蓬加（Anyango Mpinga ） ， 前者是被《福布斯非洲》杂志列为最有前途的年轻企业家之一，后者是肯尼亚最著名的设计师之一。 时装设计行业的成功不是这三位妇女唯一的共同点。 在签约她贸易计划前，她们都在试图扩大业务时遇到了性别相关壁垒。 但还有数百万其他妇女仍然需要解密出口密码。 如果她们所面临的额壁垒无法解决，我们就无法在有生之年实现性别平等。 赋能妇女，让她们充分参与全球贸易不仅仅是一个道德问题。 这也是一个经济任务，因为繁荣的出口部门能够改善竞争力，创造更优渥的就业岗位。 魔力方案固然不存在，但她贸易计划和类似项目证明了我们可以做什么。 只要有正确的政策，男性和女性的境遇都能变好。 第一步是要用工具、技能和信心武装女性企业家，让她们破解出口密码。 一旦实现了这一点，就没有什么能够限制她们的成就。"

            "Making “Women’s Work” Count ISTANBUL – Over the next few months, the 12,000 employees based at Apple’s headquarters in Cupertino, California will complete their move to an extravagant new campus. The “spaceship,” covering 2.8 million square feet, includes a two-story yoga studio, running paths, and even revolutionary pizza boxes that keep slices crisp. One thing it does not have, however, is daycare. When it comes to ignoring the importance of childcare for working parents, Apple is far from unique. And that omission places a powerful drag on parents’ ability to achieve their economic potential, with women suffering the most. Worldwide, women carry out twice as much unpaid domestic and care work – including raising children, caring for sick or elderly family members, and managing the household – as men do. In Mexico, India, and Turkey, women do three times more care work than men. This “gender chore gap” limits women’s choices, as it impedes their ability to obtain formal education, secure good jobs, and achieve equal pay. Indeed, though women around the world actually work more than men in total (including both paid and unpaid work), they earn one quarter less, on average, hold only one quarter of executive positions in the private sector, and occupy less than one quarter of all seats in national parliaments. Only half of working-age women worldwide are in the paid labor force, compared to more than three quarters of men. This situation is slowly beginning to change. Unpaid household and care work is gradually shedding its reputation as “women’s work,” and men today are assuming more household responsibilities than their fathers and grandfathers did. Some countries, particularly in Europe, are revising traditional leave policies so that parents can choose how to allocate time off after the birth of a child. More broadly, the value of unpaid household and care work – not just for children and family members, but also for the long-term health of societies and economies – is increasingly being recognized. Efforts to measure the contribution of care work to national economies have produced estimates ranging from 20% to 60% of GDP. In 2015, United Nations member states adopted the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which call for recognizing, reducing, and redistributing unpaid care work – a measure long proposed by feminist economists and gender-equality advocates. The question now is what can actually be done to meet this objective. The responsibility will lie, first and foremost, with governments. After all, while businesses or neighborhood associations may offer childcare options to working parents, costs and quality vary widely. Government action is needed to ensure that care services cover all who need them – from preschool children to the sick, the disabled, and the elderly – and that they are universally accessible and affordable. Beyond services, however, achieving the SDGs’ targets will require policy change. Most important, governments must establish requirements for parental and family leave programs. Together with private companies, they can also provide monetary incentives for men and women to share household and care work more equally. Such policies have proved effective not only in Northern Europe – the most commonly cited model – but also in Eastern European countries like Lithuania, Estonia, and even Hungary, demonstrating that they can be applied anywhere. At a time when many governments, particularly in the developing world, are faced with severe fiscal constraints, such interventions may seem farfetched. But spending on the care sector should be viewed as an investment, not a cost. A recent study in Turkey showed that one dollar of public money invested in the care sector could create 2.5 times as many jobs as a dollar invested in the construction industry. More than half of those jobs – decent jobs that could raise incomes and living standards, particularly for poor households – would go to women. International institutions can play an important role in helping governments to seize the opportunities presented by investment in the care sector. In the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the United Nations Development Programme undertook an initiative that helped women who had mostly worked at home their entire lives to find jobs in the care sector, enabling them to make use of their skills, by caring for children and for young adults with disabilities, while earning an income. As populations grow and age, the care sector will only increase in importance. Adapting to these new circumstances now will give countries a considerable advantage, as it bolsters women’s rights and freedoms, generates jobs, and make societies more equal. So what are we waiting for?",
            "让“女性的工作”创造价值 伊斯坦布尔 — — 接下来的几个月，加利福尼亚州库比蒂诺市苹果总部的12,000名员工将要完成向豪华新址的搬迁工作。 占地280万平方英尺的新址“宇宙飞船”包括一座两层的瑜伽工作室、跑道甚至是能保持比萨饼酥脆的革命性的比萨盒。 但新址却没有日间托儿所。 在无视托儿工作对职业父母的重要性方面，苹果绝不是独一无二的。 这样的忽视对父母发挥其经济潜力造成了巨大的拖累，其中尤以女性受损最多。 世界范围内，女性所从事的不计薪酬的家务和护理工作是男性的两倍 — — 其中包括抚养子女、照顾患病或年老的家庭成员，以及承担家庭管理工作。 在墨西哥、印度和土耳其，女性承担了超过男性三倍的护理工作。 这样的“性别家务差距”限制了女性的选择，因为它导致女性无法接受正规教育、寻找良好工作并获取同等报酬。 事实上，尽管全世界的女性实际付出的劳动多于男性（包括付费及无偿劳动 ） ， 但她们的平均收入却比男性低1/4，仅仅占据1/4的私营部门管理岗位，并且在全部国家议会席位中仅占不到1/4的份额。 全世界仅半数工作年龄女性参与有偿劳动，而男性这一比例则超过3/4。 这种情况正在慢慢发生变化。 无偿的家务和护理工作正逐渐褪去“女性工作”的名声，而今天的男性与他们的父辈和祖辈相比正在承担更多的家务职责。 某些国家，尤其是欧洲国家，正在修改传统的休假政策，以便有孩子的家长可以选择在孩子降生后如何分配休假时间。 更广义地讲，无偿家务和护理工作的价值 — — 不仅针对子女和家庭成员，而且针对长期社会和经济健康 — — 正在越来越多地被人们所认识到。 据衡量护理工作对国家经济贡献的项目估计，护理工作创造了20~60%的GDP。 2015年，联合国成员国通过了可持续发展目标（SDGs ） ， 要求承认、减少和重新分配无偿护理工作 — — 这是一项女权主义经济学家和性别平等倡导者长期以来积极建议的举措。 现在的问题是人们可以为实现这一目标做些什么。 责任首先在于政府。 归根结底，虽然企业或社区协会可以向职业父母提供育儿选择，但成本和质量差别很大。 只有政府采取行动才能确保所有需求者都能得到护理服务 — — 从学龄前儿童到病人、残疾人和老年人 — — 而且这些服务必须经济实惠、随处可得。 不过除服务外，实现可持续发展目标将需要改变政策。 最重要的是，政府必须制定家长和家庭假的硬性规则。 政府可以与私营企业合作为平均分担家务和护理工作的男性和女性提供货币奖励。 事实证明这样的政策不仅在最常被用作范例的北欧地区有效 — — 而且在立陶宛、爱沙尼亚甚至匈牙利等东欧国家也取得了很好的效果，事实表明这样的政策在地域上是普适的。 在许多国家政府，尤其是发展中国家政府，普遍面临严重财政困难的时刻，这样的干预措施或许看起来是不切实际的。 但护理行业的开支应当被视为一种投资，而不是一种代价。 近期土耳其的一项研究表明对护理行业投入一美元的公共资金可以创造建筑业单位投资2.5倍的工作。 这些工作中有超过半数 — — 这些体面的工作可以提高贫困家庭的收入和生活水平 — — 主要分配给女性求职者。 国际机构可以在协助政府抓住护理行业投资机遇方面发挥重要的作用。 在前南斯拉夫马其顿共和国，联合国开发计划署采取了一项举措，协助多数时间在家工作的妇女在护理行业寻找工作，促使她们能够运用自己的技能，照顾儿童和残疾青年，并同时赚取收入。 随着人口数量和年龄的增长，护理行业的重要性只会不断增加。 现在适应这样的新情况将赋予国家相当大的竞争优势，因为它增强了女性的自由和权利、创造了就业机会并且提高了社会的平等度。 既然如此，我们还在等什么？"

            "Worker Protests In China: Plentiful But Preempted The last annualized figure for labor protests that Beijing was willing to announce publicly was 100,000 for the year 1999. But a 2001 internal report from the Ministry of Public Security disclosed that the numbers \"began a rise like a violent wind\" from 1997, the year of the Communist Party's Fifteenth Congress, which pressed for factory firings in the name of \"efficiency.\" While the government is determined to keep news of all disturbances out of the media--or at least downplay their size and disruptiveness--it has been possible to collect information on nearly 200 separate events occurring between 1994 and 2004, some from news sources in Hong Kong, some from the Western media, and a few from Chinese publications. They all exhibit the same, unchanging pattern: the government, whether in Beijing or the localities, tolerates the low-decibel, smaller-scale, relatively non-disruptive marches and sit-ins by demonstrators bearing petitions and posters, especially if they appear to be spontaneous, un-organized, localized and leaderless. The incidents loom substantially more dangerous to the political elite if they seem to have been mobilized by dissidents, are marked by some measure of violence, threaten to spread, or entail the obstruction of major transport trunklines. Indeed, the episodes that make it into the media beyond the Mainland are usually such protests. What is sparking so much unrest in a country usually depicted as daily growing more affluent? Generally the causes are these: unpaid wages and pensions; sudden and massive job terminations; and management corruption held responsible for the bankruptcy of industrial enterprises--where discharged workers were secure, enjoying privileges and benefits, since the 1950s. Job losses in the range of 60 million have suddenly rendered nearly an eighth of the urban populace indigent. Often without a dependable channel for airing their grievances, hordes of laid-off workers and retired folk have filled the avenues over the past decade or so. Doesn't the government mind if so much of its urban populace is sinking into poverty and becoming disaffected? Why is this stability-obsessed regime allowing so much instability? In fact, the leaders are terribly uneasy about the situation and discuss it frequently. Some of the response has been coldly coercive. But there is also a compensatory effort that has absorbed much of the energy of the bureaucracies for labor and social security, and for civil affairs. For 2004, the central government allocated some 78 billion yuan for laid-off workers and the poor, with localities also upping their outlays. But the sad truth is that probably only about a quarter of those pushed out of their plants ever received assistance. For those who have, however, this policy has nipped discontent in the bud. Additionally, there have been attempts to create new posts, develop labor-intensive industries and small and medium sized firms, promote the private sector, and encourage service jobs, plus offering occupational training: the government allocated an additional 4.7 billion yuan expressly for job creation in 2004. These policies mitigate the pain of job loss for their recipients. Promotion of the law also aims at alleviating anger. As workers' consciousness of their rights increases, they are gradually more and more apt to appeal grievances to the courts: from 1995 to 2001, adjudicated labor disputes rose from 28,000 to 101,000. Offering workers legal redress has turned their attention temporarily from the streets to mediation and may well have reduced the number of street demonstrations. Other initiatives are a program of allowances, training and placement for the laid-off; unemployment insurance (which, unfortunately, depends on the economic health of the firm to which a worker was once attached); and pension reform--having similar problems. There is also a scheme to supply a \"minimum livelihood guarantee\" to the desperately poor. Recipients numbered over 20 million as of early 2004, when 15 billion yuan was budgeted for the program (with the central government contributing a full 60%). These programs are noticed at the grassroots, with the indigent feeling grateful for them. Protest in China has spun upward dramatically in recent years, in numbers, scale, and organization. But by the means listed above the regime has become adept at suppressing opposition. Its power to intimidate and punish may trump all its other moves to stay ahead of the discontent. But overall, increasing responsiveness--if clearly not in a democratic mode--has managed to maintain the instability that does exist at a level and within a scope that marks a game of unwritten rules -- one of complainants confining their choler within understood bounds and of the government watchful over an ever-simmering stew.",
            "中国的工人抗议：众而不力？ 中国官方愿意公布的上一个关于年度劳工抗议活动的数字是1999年的100000起。 而据公安部2001年的一份内部报告披露，该数字自1997年以来“如疾风般增长 ” 。 虽然中国政府决意对媒体封锁一切可能引发骚动的消息—或至少轻描淡写地报道其规模和破坏性—但我们仍然能够从发生在1994至2004年间的200多次不同事件中收集到信息。 这些事件只是在这期间实际发生而却未被报道的数千起事件的冰山一角。 这些报道反映了同一种普遍增强之中的模式：各级政府，不论是北京还是地方，一般而言都容忍由手持请愿书和标语的农民和工人参与的，声势和规模较小且非破坏性的游行和静坐。 如果示威者们只是自发、无组织、地方性和无领袖的，政府对其态度则更为宽容。 政治精英层对于那些可能由持不同政见者发动的，带有明显暴力性质的，体现出某种组织性的，以扩大化相威胁的或造成交通主动脉堵塞的动乱则不那么包容了。 的确，在中国大陆之外得以报道的少数事件往往都包含抗议者卧轨或阻塞城市主干道，攻击权力机关或与之发生冲突，拘留和逮捕等因素。 在这么一个通常被描绘为发展日新月异和高度强调“稳定”的国家，是什么在诱发这些不安定因素呢？ 原因是：拖欠工资和养老金；突然和大量地终止劳动合同；造成一些工业企业破产的腐败官员；以及绝大多数从1950年代共产党政权早期就一直得以保证的社会主义权益的终结。 的确，在许多中国人日渐富裕的同时，失业让许多大城市近八分之一的正式登记居民直接陷入贫困。 为了废止被后毛泽东时代的领导人们认为是过度和浪费的社会主义计划经济，自1990年代早期以来就有6000万国有企业职工因工厂效益差而被解雇。 这些国有企业难以为继的原因是缺乏先进的技术和设备，管理不善或资产侵占，沉重的社会福利负担，或是来自国内外更为现代化和更有成本效率的非国有企业的竞争。 由于没有真正可靠的渠道申诉不平，在过去的十年里，许许多多被解雇的工人和被迫下岗（只拿部分养老金）的工人正向政府发起挑战。 难道这个自我标榜为“人民的”政府不在乎如此之多的城市平民陷入贫困，不满情绪与日俱增吗？ 为什么这个重视稳定多于一切的政权允许这么多的不稳定因素存在呢？ 事实是，虽然党的领导人们对这样的情况甚为不安并频繁商议对策，但在中国两种制度的过渡时期他们能有所作为的空间是有限的。 共产党对“社会不稳定”的危险紧箍咒般的强调，和不遗余力地掌握政权，使得其官员们被迫以有限的手段来应对这些爆发性的不安定的现实及其背后的原因。 同时这些动乱也使共产党蒙羞，它本应代表无产阶级的最高利益。 但它也采取了一些补偿性的措施，让劳动、社会保障和民政部门的官僚们忙得不亦乐乎。 他们都必须为平息社会动荡而划拨数目可观的应急资金。 该计划在为下岗职工提供基本的生活费、医疗保险和养老金方面起到了临时管理者的作用。 同时，它也试图为下岗工人寻找新的就业机会或为他们自己创业提供优惠的条件。 实际上，中央政府在2004年共划拨779亿元巨款用于下岗工人和贫困人口，各级地方政府也同时加大了拨款力度。 但悲哀的是可能只有约四分之一的下岗工人曾得到过任何有实际意义的帮助。 而对于那些成千上万未能受惠的工人，这项政策已将他们的不满掐灭在萌芽状态。 随着广大工人的维权意识日渐加强，他们更倾向于向法庭申诉冤情。 的确，在1995至2001年间，法院裁决的劳资纠纷从28000件增加到了101000件。 诚然，工人们时常发现由于受贿和被告的经理人们更大的影响力，仲裁并没有起到多大作用。 但法律途径至少将一部分心怀不满的工人的注意力暂时从走上街头转移到法律调解，而这就有助于减少对抗性的街头示威。 虽然如此，在过去几年里，中国城市抗议活动的数量还是大幅增加，而且据警方的报告称，它们的规模更大也更有组织了。 到目前为止，政府通过控制媒体（从而防止一个抗议运动了解另一个并与之串联 ） ， 通过发放临时津贴安抚失业工人，和镇压及关押不听劝阻的人等方式成功地保持了总体的稳定。 然而，与由苛捐杂税、官员腐败和肆意征地引发的农民抗议活动联系起来考量，以上所为也不过是权宜之计。 共产党的领导人们发现自己正面临着一种令他们极为不安的情况。 因为现在中国共产党所面临的政治威胁不再像1989年时那样由学生和知识分子构成，而是由工人和农民构成。 荒谬的是，毛泽东正是以这两个被剥削阶级为基础建立了他的革命，而中国共产党以正是以他们的名义进行着一直以来的一党专政。"

            "Workers’ Paradise? CAMBRIDGE -- Will the political resurgence of labor unions throw a wrench into the wheels of globalization? Or will their growing strength serve to make globalization more sustainable by fostering great equality and fairness? One way or the other, unions stand as a major wild card for the evolution of our economic system in 2008 and beyond. Unions’ rising influence is evident in many recent events: German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s controversial deal to raise minimum wages for postal employees; several American presidential candidates’ open misgivings about trade and immigration; and the Chinese leadership’s nascent concerns about labor standards. Along with their political clout, unions’ intellectual respectability is also experiencing a renaissance. After decades of vilification by economists for raising unemployment and strangling growth, the union movement is now receiving backing from thought leaders such as Paul Krugman, who argues that stronger unions are needed to counter globalization’s worst excesses. The sudden emergence of unions as a political force is particularly surprising in the United States, where private-sector union membership has fallen from 25% in 1975 to 8% today. From high-tech Google to mass retailer Wal-Mart, US companies have found ways to keep their shops union-free. Only the public sector, where the membership rate is 35%, has remained a union bastion. One of my best friends from childhood married a union organizer who found it so difficult to land a job in the US that he eventually moved his family to strike-happy Canada. Today, US political leaders such as Congressman Barney Frank want to bring back unions. But there is good reason to be skeptical. For a relatively poor country like China, real unions could help balance employers’ power, bringing quality-of-life benefits that outweigh the growth costs. Factory conditions in parts of China are all too reminiscent of the early twentieth-century, pre-union US. Thousands of Chinese workers die each year in coal mines that sometimes lack basic safety precautions. But, for the US and rich countries in Europe, the argument that stronger unions would bring more benefits than costs is far more dubious. Nowadays, most workers already have legal and statutory rights that cover the basic protections that unions originally fought for a century ago. Instead, union influence today all too often serves to promulgate inflexible work practices and flat salary structures that do not adequately reward work effort and skill. It is no surprise that the public sector, where productivity is low and fiscal constraints soft, typically has the greatest union concentration. Teachers’ unions, especially, are a catastrophe, blocking any rationalization or improvement of many countries’ education systems. Before the modern globalization era, unions could thrive by organizing on a national scale, giving them enormous bargaining power vis-à-vis both employers and consumers. Now, after the explosive post-war expansion of global trade, most unions have seen their monopoly power eroded, if not shattered. That is why unions throughout much of the developed world have been fighting so hard to block free-trade negotiations that might erode their position further. Some of the issues that unions are promoting, such as human rights and environmental quality, are unassailable. When they try to connect these issues with trade, however, their motives become questionable. A case in point is union lobbying against the US-Colombia free-trade agreement, ratification of which would greatly advance US-Latin American relations. Legitimate questions about how the Colombian government conducted its epic civil war with drug-financed rebels do not trump broader issues. So anti-pact activists have complained that Colombia is anti-union because it does not protect union members from rebel violence. Yet the Colombian government notes that all Colombians suffer from rebel violence – union members actually experience less of it than the rest of the population. Unfortunately, this play is being re-enacted across a host of trade issues, including many involving China. For rich countries, income redistribution is much better handled through taxes and benefits system, rather than by government edicts to strengthen unions. The rich today pay so little in taxes in many countries, that it would be a big improvement simply to move to a flat tax, with a very high exemption level so that lower-income families pay nothing. For middle-income countries, it is a tougher call. But here, too, increasing workers’ legal and statutory rights, while allowing most unions to fade away, seems like the right approach. Unfortunately, we are far more likely to see unions’ growing political influence become a major destabilizing force in trade and growth, with highly uncertain consequences. When we see political leaders in many rich countries pander to unions by bashing each other on free trade and immigration, there is every reason to worry about trouble ahead. That is why unions will be one of the main economic wild cards in 2008.",
            "是工人们的天堂吗？ 剑桥 - - 众多工会组织在政治上东山再起是否会阻碍全球化的进展呢？ 或者其日益增长的实力通过促进平等和公平而让全球化更为可以持续呢？ 不管怎样，工会在2008年及其今后将会成为我们的经济制度演进中的一个难以琢磨的因素。 工会日盛的影响力在最近许多事件中都昭然若揭。 德国总理默克尔为邮政职工提高最低工资引发了争议；几个美国总统侯选人对贸易和移民公开表示担忧；而中国领导人最近则对劳工标准表示关切。 工会在智识上的受尊敬程度与其政治影响力一样在复苏。 几十年来，经济学家们诽谤说工会增加了失业并限制增长。 现在，工会运动则得到了思想界人士例如格鲁格曼的支持。 他们说人们需要更为强大的工会来对抗全球化最为糟糕的方面。 在美国，工会突然间作为一支政治力量显现尤其令人惊讶。 美国私营部门工会成员人数从1975年的25%下降到今天的8 % 。 从高技数的谷歌到大型零售店沃尔玛，美国的公司有办法把工会组织拒之门外。 公共部门的成员比例达到35 % ， 也只有它才继续保持成为工会的堡垒。 我儿时最好的一个朋友嫁给了一个工会组织者。 他发现在美国根本难以找到工作，于是最终举家搬到了罢工快乐的加拿大。 今天，美国的政治领导人例如国会议员富兰克想要恢复工会的风光。 但是人们有充足的理由对此表示怀疑。 对于一个类似中国那样相对较穷的国家，真正的工会可以制约雇主的权力并且带来超过经济增长代价的生活质量的利益。 在中国的一些地方，工厂的条件让人想起二十世纪早期工会发展之前的美国。 中国每年有几千名煤矿工人死亡，这些煤矿有时缺乏基本的安全保护措施。 但是，对于美国和欧洲的富国们来说，更为强大的工会带来的利益大于代价，这一论点是难以令人信服的。 当今，大多数工人已经有了法律和法定权利，这些权利包含了工会在一个世纪前所争取的基本保护措施。 相反，如今工会的影响力过多地用来公布不能足以奖励工作干劲和技能的僵化的工作实务以及划一的工资结构。 公共部门效率低下，没有太多的财政限制，通常工会组织最为集中，这也就不足为奇了。 教师工会特别是一个灾难，它们阻碍许多国家教育体系中任何合理化和改进。 现代全球化时代之前，工会可以通过在全国范围内组织而发展壮大，从而在对雇主和消费者上给了它们巨大的讨价还价的实力。 现在，全球贸易在战后爆炸式发展，大多数工会发现其垄断实力要么瓦解，要么受到侵蚀。 这就是为何发达国家中的工会不遗余力地阻碍可能进一步侵蚀其实力的自由贸易谈判。 工会所促进得某些问题，例如人权和环境质量是无可非议的。 但是，当它们企图把这些问题与贸易挂钩的时候，它们的动机就变得可疑了。 其中一个事例就是工会游说反对美国和哥伦比亚的自由贸易协议。 批准这一协议将会大大增进美国和拉美国家的关系。 哥伦比亚支付与贩毒组织支持的反叛力量进行了艰苦卓绝的内战，对于其如何进行这一内战的合理的问题并不让更为广泛的问题消失殆尽。 因此，反对这一协议的活动份子们抱怨说哥伦比亚反对工会，因为它并不保护工会成员免于反叛者的暴力。 但是哥伦比亚政府注意到，所有的哥伦比亚人都受到反叛者暴力之苦，而工会成员实际上要比国内其他人经���的要少。 不幸的是，在许多贸易问题上这一闹剧都在重演，包括中国在内。 对于富国而言，通过税收和福利制度可以更好地处理收入重新分配，而非通过政府法令来加强工会组织。 如今，许多国家的富人纳税很少，倒不如干脆转向免税额度很高的单一税，这样低收入家庭就不必纳税。 对于中等收入国家而言，这是难以做出的决定。 但是在这一问题上还是这样，也就是增加工人们的法律和法定权利，同时让大多数工会自生自灭似乎是一个正确的办法。 不幸的是，我们更有可能发现工会不断增长的政治影响力成为贸易和经济增长的一个主要不稳定力量，其后果令人难以预料。 当我们看到富有国家中的许多政治领导人通过在自由贸易和移民问题上相互抨击对方而取悦于工会之时，人们就有理由担心今后的麻烦。 这就是为何工会将会成为2008年主要的一个不可知的经济因素之一。"

            "The Evolution of Work CAMBRIDGE – In mid-December, the United Nations will launch the latest of its annual landmark Human Development Reports. This year’s report focuses on the nature of work: how the way we earn a living is being transformed by economic globalization, new technologies, and innovations in social organization. The outlook for developing countries, in particular, is decidedly mixed. For most people most of the time, work is mostly unpleasant. Historically, doing lots of backbreaking work is how countries have become rich. And being rich is how some people get the chance to do more pleasant work. Thanks to the Industrial Revolution, new technologies in cotton textiles, iron and steel, and transportation delivered steadily rising levels of labor productivity for the first time in history. First in Britain in the mid-eighteenth century, and then in Western Europe and North America, men and women flocked from the countryside to towns to satisfy factories’ growing demand for labor. But, for decades, workers gained few of the benefits of rising productivity. They worked long hours in stifling conditions, lived in overcrowded and unsanitary housing, and experienced little growth in earnings. Some indicators, such as workers’ average height, suggest that standards of living may have even declined for a while. Eventually, capitalism transformed itself and its gains began to be shared more widely. This was partly because wages naturally began to rise as the surplus of rural workers dried up. But, equally important, workers organized themselves to defend their interests. Fearing revolution, the industrialists compromised. Civil and political rights were extended to the working class. Democracy, in turn, tamed capitalism further. Employment conditions improved as state-mandated or negotiated arrangements led to reduced working hours, greater safety, and family, health, and other benefits. Public investment in education and training made workers both more productive and freer to exercise choice. As a result, labor’s share of the enterprise surplus rose. While factory jobs never became pleasant, blue-collar occupations now enabled a middle-class standard of living, with all its consumption possibilities and lifestyle opportunities. Eventually, technological progress undermined industrial capitalism. Labor productivity in manufacturing industries rose much faster than in the rest of the economy: The same or higher quantity of steel, cars, and electronics could be produced with far fewer workers. So the “excess” workers moved to service industries – education, health, finance, entertainment, and public administration, for example. Thus was born the post-industrial economy. Work became more pleasant for some, but not for all. For those with the skills, capital, and savvy to prosper in the post-industrial age, services offered inordinate opportunities. Bankers, consultants, and engineers earned much higher wages than their industrial-age forebears. Equally important, office work allowed a degree of freedom and personal autonomy that factory work never provided. Notwithstanding long hours (perhaps longer than in factory jobs), service professionals enjoyed much greater control over their daily lives and workplace decisions. Teachers, nurses, and waiters were not paid nearly as well, but they, too, were released from the humdrum mechanical drudgery of the shop floor. For less skilled workers, however, service-sector jobs meant giving up the negotiated benefits of industrial capitalism. The transition to a service economy often went hand in hand with the decline of unions, employment protections, and norms of pay equity, greatly weakening workers’ bargaining power and job security. So the post-industrial economy opened up a new chasm in the labor market, between those with stable, high-paid, and fulfilling services jobs and those with fleeting, low-paid, and unsatisfying jobs. Two factors determined the share of each type of job – and thus the extent of inequality produced by the post-industrial transition: the education and skill level of the workforce, and the degree of institutionalization of labor markets in services (in addition to manufacturing). Inequality, exclusion, and duality became more marked in countries where skills were poorly distributed and many services approximated the textbook “ideal” of spot markets. The United States, where many workers are forced to hold multiple jobs in order to make an adequate living, remains the canonical example of this model. The vast majority of workers still live in low- and middle-income countries and have yet to go through these transformations. There are two reasons to believe that their future path will (or need) not unfold in quite the same way. First, there is no reason that safe working conditions, freedom of association, and collective bargaining cannot be introduced at earlier stages of development than has occurred historically. Just as political democracy need not wait for incomes to rise, strong labor standards need not lag behind economic development. Workers in low-income countries should not be deprived of fundamental rights for the sake of industrial development and export performance. Second, the forces of globalization and technological progress have combined to alter the nature of manufacturing work in a way that makes it very difficult, if not impossible, for newcomers to emulate the industrialization experience of the Four Asian Tigers, or the European and North American economies before them. Many (if not most) developing countries are becoming service economies without having developed a large manufacturing sector – a process I have called “premature de-industrialization.” Could premature de-industrialization be a blessing in disguise, enabling workers in the developing world to bypass the drudgery of manufacturing? If so, how such a future could be constructed is not at all clear. A society in which most workers are self-proprietors – shopkeepers, independent professionals, or artists – and set their own terms of employment while making an adequate living is feasible only when economy-wide productivity is already very high. High-productivity services – such as IT or finance – require well-trained workers, not the unskilled kind that poor countries have in abundance. So there is both good and bad news for the future of work in developing countries. Thanks to social policy and labor rights, workers can become full stakeholders in the economy much earlier in the process of development. At the same time, the traditional engine of economic development – industrialization – is likely to operate at much lower capacity. The resulting combination of high public expectations and low income-producing capacity will be a major challenge for developing economies everywhere.",
            "工作的演化 坎布里奇—12月中旬，联合国将发布最新一期标志性的年度人权发展报告。 今年的报告关注焦点是工作的性质：我们讨生活的方式如何被经济全球化、新科技和社会组织方面的创新所改变。 特别是，发展中国家的前景十分模糊。 对大部分时间里的大部分人来说，工作大多是不令人愉快的。 历史上，辛苦勤劳地工作是国家致富的源泉。 而变富是一些人有机会做比较令人愉快的工作的原因。 拜工业革命所赐，棉花纺织、钢铁和交通方面的新科技给我们带来了历史上第一次劳动生产率水平的稳步提高。 先是十九世纪中叶的英国，然后是西欧和北美，男男女女从乡村涌向城镇以满足工厂对劳动力的不断增长的需求。 但是，在几十年的时间里，工人几乎没有得到任何生产率提高所带来的好处。 他们在令人窒息的环境中长时间工作，住在没有卫生设施的拥挤的宿舍中，收入也几乎没有增长。 一些指标，如工人平均体重，表明生活质量可能下降了一段时间。 最终，资本主义改变了它自己，其收益得到了更加广泛的分享。 这部分是因为，随着农村剩余工人数量的枯竭，工资自然开始上涨。 但是，同样重要的是，工人们开始自发组织起来捍卫自己的利益。 产业家害怕革命，只能妥协。 公民和政治权利扩大到工人阶级。 民主反过来进一步制约了资本主义。 国家规定或劳资双方商定的安排降低了工作时长，增加了安全度，提高了家庭、医疗和其他福利，就业环境有了改善。 教育和培训方面的公共投资提高了工人的生产率，也让他们能够更自由地进行选择。 于是，劳动力占企业盈余的份额开始上升。 工厂工作仍然不令人愉快，但蓝领岗位已能够让人过上中产阶级的生活，拥有中产阶级的消费能力和生活方式机会。 最终，科技进步打破了产业资本主义。 制造业的劳动生产率增长远远快于经济的其他部分：质量相同或更高的钢材、汽车和电子产品，只需要少得多的工人就可以生产出来。 因此“过剩”的工人们进入服务业 — — 教育、医疗、金融、娱乐和公共管理等。 后工业经济诞生了。 对一些人来说，工作变得更加令人愉快了，但并非所有人都是如此。 对拥有技能、资本和见识，能够在后工业时代实现发达的人来说，服务业带来了超乎想象的机会。 银行家、咨询师和工程师的收入远远高于他们工业时代的前辈。 同样重要的是，办公室工作提供了工厂工作所不具备的一定程度的自由和自主性。 尽管工作时间很长（可能比工厂岗位更长 ） ， 但服务业专业人士能更好地控制日常生活和决定工作场合。 教师、护士和侍应生的薪酬并不是很高，但他们可以摆脱商场中单调乏味的机械式工作。 但是，对于技能较弱的工人来说，服务业岗位意味着放弃与产业资本主义商定的福利。 转向服务经济常常与工会、就业保护、薪酬平等性规范的式微一起发生，大大削弱了工人的议价能力和岗位安全度。 因此，后工业经济开启了劳动力市场的新差异，一端是稳定、高薪、有满足感的服务业岗位，一端是动荡、低薪、的满意度的岗��。 两大因素决定了每一种类型岗位的比重 — — 也决定了后工业转型所带来的不平等程度：劳动力的教育和技能水平，以及（制造业以外的）服务业劳动力市场的制度化水平。 在技能分布情况糟糕、许多服务类似于教科书上的“理想”现货市场的国家，不平等、排斥和二元性日益显著。 在美国，许多工人被迫打多份工才能维持体面的生活，堪称这一模式的经典案例。 仍然生活在中低收入国家的绝大部分工人尚未完成这些转型。 基于两个原因，可以认为他们的未来路径不会（或不必）一样。 首先，没有理由认为安全的工作环境、结社自由和集体议价必须遵循历史模式，而不能在发展的较早阶段就引入。 正如政治民主必须要等待收入上升才能开始，提高劳动标准也不一定要落后于经济发展。 低收入国家的工人不应该为了工业发展和出口表现而被剥夺基本权利。 其次，全球化和科技进步的力量已经形成合力，改变了制造业工作的性质，后进者很难甚至不可能模仿亚洲四小龙或更早的欧洲和北美经济体的工业化经验。 许多（甚至大部分）发展中国家在没有发展出巨大的制造业的情况下就开始转向服务经济 — — 我称之为“早产去工业化”过程。 早产去工业化可能是一种伪装的福音，让发展中世界的工人直接跳过枯燥乏味的制造业吗？ 如果答案是肯定的，那么未来可能怎样尚不清楚。 一个社会中的大部分工人都自我就业 — — 成为店主、独立专业人士或艺术家 — — 有各自的就业条件，同时能够过上体面的生活，这种社会只有在全经济生产率相当高的情况下才可行。 高生产率服务业 — — 如IT和金融 — — 需要受过良好训练的工人，而不是穷国遍地都是的低技能工人。 因此，对于发展中国家的工作的未来来说，既有好消息，也有坏消息。 拜社会政策和劳动权利所赐，工人能够在发展过程的较早阶段就成为经济的完全相关利益方。 与此同时，传统社会发展引擎 — — 工业化 — — 可能动力较低。 由此产生的高公共预期和低收入产生能力的组合可能成为所有发展中经济体的主要挑战。"

            "The Unfinished Business of Gender Parity DAVOS – When it comes to the importance of gender equality in the workplace, the message has clearly gotten through to those at the top. Surveys – including those conducted by my own organization – consistently show that business leaders understand the need for equal treatment of men and women in the workforce. Indeed, my own conversations with senior businesspeople around the world confirm that progress clearly is being made. The vast majority recognize the issue as imperative to their companies’ success and have implemented measures to promote gender parity in their organizations. And yet, for all the fine words, much more remains to be done before gender parity is actually achieved. The facts speak for themselves. There is still a pay gap in every country in the world, with men earning more than women for similar jobs. Likewise, the percentage of seats on corporate boards occupied by women appears to have stalled at just over 17%. This bias has not gone unnoticed – especially among female employees. In a 2015 PwC global survey of female millennials born between 1980 and 1995, half of those working in financial services said they believed that men received more favorable treatment when it came to promotions. More than 70% said that as much as their organizations talk about diversity, in reality, opportunities remain unequal. Interestingly, other studies conclude that when women are provided with the opportunity to perform on an equal footing with men, they more often than not come out on top. A recent ten-year analysis of 300 start-up investments backed by venture capitalists in the United States showed that companies with a female founder performed 63% better than those with all-male founding teams. And another of PwC’s research programs, examining the changing faces of billionaires worldwide, discovered what we called the “Athena Factor.” The increase in the number of female billionaires significantly outpaces that among men, with Asia registering the fastest growth in the ranks of self-made female billionaires. Where women have the opportunity to capitalize on their talents, they are doing so successfully and with gusto. Meanwhile, there is growing recognition of the positive contribution that greater workforce diversity makes to business performance. And yet, as reflected in the stubborn persistence of the pay gap, barriers to women’s progress remain. What is now needed is a genuine and permanent shift in attitudes and behavior. Many of the biases holding women back are unconscious; and, by their very nature, these blind spots cannot be tackled by statements of intent alone. Tackling gender inequality will require us to identify where, how, and why these biases materialize, and to develop systematic strategies and interventions to root them out. In order to accomplish this, businesses must actively challenge men to help advance women in the workforce. That is why I am proud to be a founding Corporate Impact Champion of the UN Women’s HeForShe movement. Creating real and lasting change will require helping men and women work together. The business case for doing so is incontrovertible. Not only do women make up half the global population; the same skills needed to work through differences in gender – open-mindedness, humility, empathy – can be used to work across other types of differences, be they cultural, physical, or personal. It is important, of course, to reassure male skeptics who view gender parity as a threat. In June 2015, I hosted a HeForShe chat on Twitter , and while the conversation was overwhelmingly positive, an obvious concern surfaced: Why should men help promote women to positions for which they themselves are aiming? Addressing such concerns will require us to show that we are not promoting some people at the expense of others; gender parity must be win-win, not zero-sum. At PwC, this is being addressed by hosting conversations in which men and women discuss gender issues collaboratively and respectfully, and by working with both genders to challenge double standards and acknowledge potential blind spots. Recent research suggests that, at the current rate of progress, it will take another 80 years to reach gender parity. That is not good enough. Let us all commit to achieving it in our lifetimes – for the benefit of everyone.",
            "性别平等的未竟事业 达沃斯 — — 高层人士已经明确开始关注在工作场所实现性别平等的重要性等问题。 包括我本人所在机构进行的各项调查结果一致表明，企业领导人对于必须平等对待男女劳动者已经有了明确的认识。 事实上，我与世界各地资深商务人士的对话证实在这方面正在取得显著的进步。 绝大部分人认识到这对企业的成功必不可少，并已着手采取措施提高所在机构的性别平等程度。 但尽管态度非常积极，真正实现性别平等还要进行很多工作。 事实是不言自明的。 工资差距仍在世界每一个国家从事类似工作的男女员工间现实存在着。 同样，女性担任公司董事的比例似乎一直徘徊在17%左右。 这样的偏见并未受到人们 — — 特别是女性员工的忽视。 2015年普华永道对生于1980和1995年间的千禧女性全球调查结果显示，从事金融服务工作的女性近半数表示她们认为男性在升职方面得到的待遇更加优越。 超过70%的女性表示尽管其所在机构提倡多样性，但在现实中她们仍然得不到平等的机会。 有趣的是，其他研究得出结论，当为女性和男性提供同等机会时，往往女性能够拔得头筹。 近期一份由美国风投人士出资进行的针对300家初创企业的投资分析表明，有女性创业者的企业业绩较之全是男性团队的企业高63%左右。 普华永道另一项研究结果显示，世界各地亿万富翁的变化体现出我们所谓的“雅典娜因素 ” 。 女性富豪人数增加明显快于男性，其中增长速度最快的首推亚洲自主创业的女性富豪。 在女性有机会发挥才华时，她们对此满怀激情并取得了成功。 与此同时，劳动力多元化对企业绩效的积极贡献越来越被人们所认识到。 不过，长期存在的工资差距显示依然存在阻碍女性进步的因素。 现在需要的是态度和行为真正的永久性变化。 阻碍女性进步的很多是无意识因素；而且，其本身性质决定了仅靠明确目的来解决这些盲区还远远不够。 改变性别不平等需要我们明确上述偏见在哪里、为什么和怎样付诸实施，并制定系统的战略和干预措施来加以铲除。 为实现上述目标，企业必须积极要求男性协助女性争取职业进步。 因此我为成为联合国女性他为她运动最初的企业影响创始者而感到自豪。 男女必须竭诚合作才能实现真正的永久性变化。 这样做有着不容置疑的商业理由。 不仅女性占到全球人口的一半；而且克服性别歧视所需的同样素质 — — 即开放、谦逊、同情 — — 同样可以克服文化、生理或人性等其他类型的不同。 当然，让怀疑性别平等是某种威胁的男性放心非常重要。 2015年6月，我在推特上主持了他��她计划的聊天活动。 虽然谈话从总体来看非常积极，但仍然出现了某种显著的担忧：男性为什么要帮助女性得到他们自己都希望得到的职务？ 安抚这些担忧需要明确我们不是要以牺牲某些人为代价来抬高另一些人；性别平等必须达到双赢、而非零和的效果。 普华永道正组织男女员工在合作和相互尊敬的基础上探讨性别问题，并与两性合作挑战双重标准、寻找潜在盲点。 近期的研究表明按照目前的发展速度，还要再过80年才能实现两性平等的目标。 这样的速度远远不够。 让我们所有人致力于在有生之年实现 — — 这对我们每个人都有好处。"

            "Four Ways to Beat HIV/AIDS PITTSBURGH – In the fight against HIV/AIDS, some stories illuminate the long road to global eradication more than others. In 2009, I heard one such story in Tanzania. I was visiting a remote village when I spoke to a woman who knew that she was HIV-positive. She told me that the established health guidelines at the time indicated that she could not receive treatment until her count of CD4 T-helper cells, a type of white blood cell used by the immune system, had dropped below a certain threshold. After walking several miles to get her count checked, she arrived at the clinic only to find its testing machine broken. The machine was still inoperative the second time she made the long journey. Only months later, after her third trip to the clinic on foot, did she receive her cell count: her levels were far below the necessary threshold. Her treatment should have begun months before. Since HIV/AIDS was first identified in 1984, it has killed more than 35 million people. Although the number of AIDS-related deaths has fallen by almost half since peaking in 2005, there are still far too many people dying from this preventable condition. In 2016 alone, one million people around the world died from HIV-related causes, while 1.8 million more became infected. Contrary to popular myth, we have not turned the corner on AIDS – not by a long shot. World AIDS Day, on December 1, is an occasion to honor the millions of victims, and to recommit to ending this devastating disease. According to UNAIDS, just 54% of HIV-positive adults, and only 43% of HIV-positive children, are currently receiving the antiretroviral therapies that save lives and prevent new infections. With so many untreated patients, the virus will continue to spread. As CEO of a global pharmaceutical company, I’m proud of the work we have done to fight HIV/AIDS around the world. Today, more than eight million people – nearly half of all patients receiving treatment for HIV in developing countries – depend on the antiretroviral treatments that we produce. But for those of us on the front lines of this struggle, our work is far from over. The pharmaceutical industry has a responsibility to expand access to testing and treatment, and to help stop the spread of HIV once and for all. Fulfilling four key commitments will make this goal achievable. For starters, pharmaceutical companies should do more to increase the availability of low-cost, generic medicines. My company, Mylan, introduced the first generic once-daily pill for developing countries in 2009, and we have continually reduced its price to make it more accessible to more people. With this treatment alone, Mylan and other generic manufacturers save the US government, international donors, and national health programs more than $4.5 billion a year. Still, treatment options could be expanded further. In September, Mylan announced a collaboration with UNAIDS, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the Clinton Health Access Initiative, and other partners to provide the next-generation single-pill HIV regimen to patients in more than 90 low- and middle-income countries for less than $75 per year. These drugs are widely used in high-income countries because they produce fewer side effects. Affordability initiatives like this one should be replicated. Next, drug makers must continue investing in capacity and supply-chain reliability. Since 2005, the number of people on antiretroviral therapies worldwide has grown by a factor of ten, to 21 million. But roughly twice as many people are currently infected with HIV. Over the last decade, Mylan has invested more than $250 million in expanding production capacity, and we now produce four billion tablets and capsules each year. But further investments are needed if we are to provide access to the other 21 million people still not on treatment. A third urgently needed commitment is to increase support for research that accelerates the development of new innovations in effective and efficient treatment delivery. For example, Mylan provides study medications to research trials, like the MaxART trial in Swaziland, which demonstrated that providing treatment to all HIV-positive people is the best way to slow the disease’s spread. We also supported the Kirby Institute’s ENCORE1 trial, to develop a reduced-dose version of the most commonly used HIV treatment regimen. And we are currently working with the US Agency for International Development as part of a partnership called OPTIMIZE, which aims to accelerate access to new therapies. We do not support trials like these because we hope to gain any marketable intellectual property – we won’t. Rather, we support them because it is the right way to advance science and improve treatment. Finally, real gains in the fight against HIV/AIDS will require drug makers to account for the limitations of health-care systems and distribution networks in the developing countries they serve. Antiretroviral therapies for children are a good example of these challenges. Drugs for young people produced in the West are often liquids that require refrigeration. But developing countries often have limited cold-storage capacities or an inability to transport liquid in bulk. That’s why Mylan has developed heat-stable, taste-masked, dispersible tablets that can easily be incorporated into food. Our scientists are now working on the next-generation formula, which comes in the equivalent of a sugar packet that even newborns can take. More innovations like these will be needed to solve the country-specific issues that patients face. The global health community has made remarkable progress in turning the tide on HIV/AIDS, introducing new products and advocating for earlier treatment. But when I think back to the woman I met in Tanzania, I am reminded of how much work remains to be done. Makers of generic medicines have an important role to play in this fight, and we will not stop working until treatment is available to every patient in the world who needs it.",
            "消灭艾滋病的四个办法 匹兹堡—在与艾滋病的战争中，一些故事更能说明通往全球消灭艾滋病的漫漫长路。 2009年，我在坦桑尼亚就听说了这样一个故事。 我访问了一个偏远村庄，和一位获知自己艾滋病毒阳性的妇女对话。 她告诉我，当时的卫生指南说，在她的CD4 辅助性T细胞（一种免疫系统中的白血球）下降到一定阈值以下之间，她不会得到治疗。 她跋涉数英里去检查CD4 辅助性T细胞，到了才发现测试机器坏掉了。 过了一段时间，她又跋涉数英里去做检查，但机器仍然坏着。 过了几个月，她第三次步行前往这家医院才成功地做了检查，她的细胞数量已经远远低于阈值。 她应该在几个月前就开始获得治疗。 自1984年艾滋病第一次被识别以来，它已经杀死了3,500万多人。 艾滋病相关死亡人数在2005年达到峰值，随后下降了近一半，但仍有太多的人因为这个可预防的疾病而失去生命。 光是在2016年，全球就有一百万人死于与艾滋病毒有关的状况，另有180万人被感染。 与流行的故事相反，我们并没有能够扭转艾滋病形势 — — 至少从长期看没有。 12月1日是世界艾滋病日，设立这个日子是为了纪念数百万受害者和鼓励人们消灭这个可怕的疾病。 据联合国艾滋病规划署的数据，目前只有54%的艾滋病毒阳性成年人，以及43%的艾滋病毒阳性儿童，正在接受能够拯救生命和阻止传染的抗逆转录疗法。 得不到治疗的患者如此之多，艾滋病毒必然还在继续传播。 作为一家全球制药公司的首席执行官，我对于我们在消灭艾滋病的全球战争中所做出的贡献深感自豪。 如今，超过八百万人 — — 相当于发展中国家接受艾滋病治疗的所有患者的近一半 — — 需要依靠我们所生产的抗逆转录治疗手段。 但对于我们这些站在这场战争最前线的人来说，我们的工作还远没有结束。 制药业有责任扩大测试和治疗的普及度，帮助一劳永逸地阻止艾滋病毒传播。 兑现四项关键承诺能够助我们实现这一目标。 首先，制药公司应该做更多的事增加低成本通用药物的普及度。 我的公司 — — 迈兰制药公司在2009年推出了第一种面向发展中国家的一日一次普通药，此后我们一直在调降药价，让它走近更多的人。 光是通过这种药，迈兰和其他通用药制造商每年都能为美国政府、国际捐助人和国家卫生计划节省45亿多美元。 尽管如此，治疗选择可以进一步扩大。 9月，迈兰宣布与联合国艾滋病规划署、比尔和梅琳达·盖茨基金会、克林顿健康倡议计划（Clinton Health Access Initiative）和其他合作者携手为90多个中低收入国家以每年不到75美元的价格提供新一代单一药物艾滋病疗法。 这些药品因其副作用更小而在高收入国家广泛使用。 此类平价计划应该被广泛复制。 其次，制药商必须继续投资于产能和供给链可靠性建设。 自2005年以来，全世界接受抗逆转录治疗的人数增加了十倍，达到了2,100万人。 但目前被艾滋病毒感染的人数两倍于此。 在过去十年中，迈兰公司投入了2.5亿多美元用于扩大产能，目前我们每年都要生产四十亿片药片和胶囊。 但如果要为另外2,100万仍然得不到治疗的人提供药物，还需要更多投资。 第三项继续做出的承诺是增加研究支持和加快高效治疗实现的新创新的开发。 比如，迈兰公司为研究实验提供研究药品，比如斯威士兰的MaxART试验，该试验发现，向所有艾滋病毒阳性人员提供治疗是遏制艾滋病蔓延的最佳办法。 我们还支持科尔比研究所（Kirby Institute）的ENCORE1测试，该测试要开发最常用艾滋病疗法的减剂量版。 目前，我们还与美国国际开发署进行合作，这是一个叫作“优化 ” （ OPTIMIZE）的合作项目的一部分，其目的是加快新疗法的普及。 我们支持此类试验不是因为我们向获得可以待价而沽的知识产权。 相反，我们支持这些试验是因为这是推动科学、改进疗法的正确方法。 最后，艾滋病战争的真正收益需要制药公司顾及它们所服务的发展中国的医疗体系和分销网络的极限。 儿童抗逆转录治疗是这类挑战的一个显例。 西方所生产的年轻人用药通常为液态，需要冷藏。 但发展中国家常常冷藏能力不足，也不具备大量运输液体的能力。 因此，迈兰公司开发了一种热稳定的矫味分散片，可以方便地掺在食品中。 我们的科学家正在开发新一代配方，将采用糖包，即使是新生儿也可以服用。 我们需要更多类似的创新来解决具体国家患者所面临的问题。 全球医疗界在扭转艾滋病趋势方面做出了重大进步，引入了新产品，推动了提早治疗。 但每当我回想起在坦桑尼亚遇到的那位妇女，我就会想起还有很多工作等着我们完成。 通用药制造商在这场战争中扮演着重要角色，我们会一直致力于此，直到全世界所有需要的患者都能得到治疗。"

            "The World Bank Needs to Return to Its Mission NEW YORK – The World Bank declares that its mission is to end extreme poverty within a generation and to boost shared prosperity. These goals are universally agreed as part of the Sustainable Development Goals. But the World Bank lacks an SDG strategy, and now it is turning to Wall Street to please its political masters in Washington. The Bank’s president, Jim Yong Kim, should find a better way forward, and he can do so by revisiting one of his own great successes. Kim and I worked closely together from 2000 to 2005, to scale up the world’s response to the AIDS epidemic. Partners in Health, the NGO led by Kim and his colleague, Harvard University’s Paul Farmer, had used antiretroviral medicines (ARVs) to treat around 1,000 impoverished HIV-infected rural residents in Haiti, and had restored them to health and hope. I pointed out to Kim and Farmer 18 years ago that their success in Haiti could be expanded to reach millions of people at low cost and with very high social benefits. I recommended a new multilateral funding mechanism, a global fund, to fight AIDS, and a new funding effort by the United States. In early 2001, UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan launched the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria, and in 2003 US President George W. Bush launched the PEPFAR program. The World Health Organization, led by the Director-General Gro Harlem Brundtland, recruited Kim to lead the WHO’s scale-up effort. Kim did a fantastic job, and his efforts provided the groundwork for bringing ARVs to millions, saving lives, livelihoods, and families. There are four lessons of that great success. First, the private sector was an important partner, by offering patent-protected drugs at production cost. Drug companies eschewed profits in the poorest countries out of decency and for the sake of their reputations. They recognized that patent rights, if exercised to excess, would be a death warrant for millions of poor people. Second, the effort was supported by private philanthropy, led by Bill Gates, who inspired others to contribute as well. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation backed the new Global Fund, the WHO, and the Commission on Macroeconomics and Health, which I led for the WHO in 2000-2001 (and which successfully campaigned for increased donor funding to fight AIDS and other killer diseases). Third, the funding to fight AIDS took the form of outright grants, not Wall Street loans. Fighting AIDS in poor countries was not viewed as a revenue-generating investment needing fancy financial engineering. It was regarded as a vital public good that required philanthropists and high-income countries to fund life-saving treatment for poor and dying people. Fourth, trained public health specialists led the entire effort, with Kim and Farmer serving as models of professionalism and rectitude. The Global Fund does not stuff the pockets of corrupt ministers, or trade funding for oil concessions or arms deals. The Global Fund applies rigorous, technical standards of public health, and holds recipient countries accountable – including through transparency and co-financing requirements – for delivering services. The World Bank needs to return to its mission. The SDGs call for, among other things, ending extreme poverty and hunger, instituting universal health coverage, and universal primary and upper secondary education by 2030. But, despite making only slow progress toward these goals, the Bank shows no alarm or strategy to help get the SDGs on track for 2030. On the contrary, rather than embrace the SDGs, the Bank is practically mute, and its officials have even been heard to mutter negatively about them in the corridors of power. Perhaps US President Donald Trump doesn’t want to hear about his government’s responsibilities vis-à-vis the SDGs. But it is Kim’s job to remind him and the US Congress of those obligations – and that it was a Republican president, George W. Bush who creatively and successfully pursued the battle against AIDS. Wall Street may help to structure the financing of large-scale renewable energy projects, public transport, highways, and other infrastructure that can pay its way with tolls and user fees. A World Bank-Wall Street partnership could help to ensure that such projects are environmentally sound and fair to the affected communities. That would be all for the good. Yet such projects, designed for profit or at least direct cost recovery, are not even remotely sufficient to end extreme poverty. Poor countries need grants, not loans, for basic needs like health and education. Kim should draw on his experience as the global health champion who successfully battled against AIDS, rather than embracing an approach that would only bury poor countries in debt. We need the World Bank’s voice and strenuous efforts to mobilize grant financing for the SDGs. Health care for the poor requires systematic training and deployment of community health workers, diagnostics, medicines, and information systems. Education for the poor requires trained teachers, safe and modern classrooms, and connectivity to other schools and to online curricula. These SDGs can be achieved, but only if there is a clear strategy, grant financing, and clear delivery mechanisms. The World Bank should develop the expertise to help donors and recipient governments make these programs work. Kim knows just how to do this, from his own experience. Trump and other world leaders are personally accountable for the SDGs. They need to do vastly more. So, too, do the world’s super-rich, whose degree of wealth is historically unprecedented. The super-rich have received round after round of tax cuts and special tax breaks, easy credits from central banks, and exceptional gains from technologies that are boosting profits while lowering unskilled workers’ wages. Even with stock markets’ recent softness, the world’s 2000+ billionaires have around $10 trillion in wealth – enough to fund fully the incremental effort needed to end extreme poverty, if the governments also do their part. When going to Wall Street, or Davos, or other centers of wealth, the World Bank should inspire the billionaires to put their surging wealth into personal philanthropy to support the SDGs. Bill Gates is doing this, with historic results, for public health. Which billionaires will champion the SDGs for education, renewable energy, fresh water and sanitation, and sustainable agriculture? With a clear SDG plan, the World Bank would find partners to help it fulfill its core, historic, and vital mission.",
            "世界银行需要回归其使命 纽约 — — 世界银行宣称在一代人的时间里消除赤贫、促进共同繁荣是其使命。 上述目标被普遍认为是可持续发展目标的组成部分。 但世界银行缺乏可持续发展战略，而现在它正在转向华尔街，以取悦华盛顿的政治领袖。 世行行长金墉应当通过回顾自己曾经取得的重大成功找到一条更好的前进之路。 2000到2005年金墉和我曾密切合作，以推广世界各国对艾滋病疫情的应对之策。 由金及其同事，哈佛大学的保罗·法莫共同领导的非政府组织“健康伙伴 ” （ Health in Health）一直在使用抗逆转录病毒的药物（AVR）来治疗约1，000名被艾滋病毒感染的贫困的海地乡村居民，并使他们的健康和希望得以恢复。 18年前我就曾对金和法默指出可以对他们在海地的成功进行推广，以较低的代价和非常高的社会效益惠及成百上千万民众。 我推荐了一种新的多边投资机制，一支抗击艾滋病的全球基金，以及促使美国开展新的投资项目。 2001年初，联合国秘书长安南发起了抗击艾滋病、结核病和疟疾的全球基金，2003年，美国总统乔治·W·布什牵头发起了总统防治艾滋病紧急援助（PEPFAR）计划。 由总干事布伦特兰夫人领导的世界卫生组织招募金墉来领导世卫组织的扩大工作。 金出色的完成了这项任务，他通过努力将抗逆转录病毒药物带给成百上千万人，为挽救生命、生计和无数家庭奠定了基础。 这一伟大的成功有四条经验可以汲取。 首先，私营部门是重要的合作伙伴，以生产成本提供具有专利保护的药物。 药品企业为了顾全声誉和体面放弃了最贫困国家的利润。 他们认识到如果过度行使专利保护，就会成为成百上千万贫困民众的催命符。 其次，由比尔·盖茨领导的私人慈善机构支持开展这项工作，并激励其他人也这么做。 比尔和梅林达·盖茨基金会支持新全球基金、世卫组织以及2000到2001年我所领导的宏观经济与医疗委员会（该委员会成功地争取了抗击艾滋病和其他致命疾病捐助资金的增加 ） 。 第三，抗击艾滋病的基金采用的形式是直接赠款而非华尔街贷款。 在贫穷国家抗击艾滋病并没有被视为需要复杂金融操作的创收型投资。 这项事业被认为是需要慈善家和高收入国家为贫困和垂死民众提供救命治疗的至关重要的公共服务。 第四，由受过专业培训的公共卫生专家来领导这项工作，职业和诚实的典型代表就是金和法莫。 全球基金并没有流向腐败部长们的口袋，也没有用卫生资金来交换石油特许权或武器协定。 全球基金采用严格的纯技术公共卫生标准，并通过账目透明和联合出资等规定对资金接受国的服务提供情况进行问责。 世行需要回归自己的使命。 可持续发展目标要求在2030年之前结束极端贫困和饥饿、实现全民健康覆盖和普及小学和高中教育的目标。 但尽管在实现上述目标方面进展非常缓慢，但世行却并未引起警惕、也没有制定相应的策略以求实现2030年可持续发展目标。 事实上，世行不但没有拥抱可持续发展目标，反而装聋作哑，而有人甚至听到世行官员在权力走廊上消极抱怨可持续发展目标。 也许美国总统唐纳德·特朗普并不想听到有关美国政府在可持续发展目标方面的责任。 但金有义务提醒他和美国国会 — — 恰恰是共和党总统乔治·W·布什创造性地成功支持了抗击艾滋病的战斗。 华尔街或许有助于安排能靠收取通行费和使用费偿还贷款的大规模可再生能源项目、公共交通、高速公路和其他基础设施项目的融资工作。 世行与华尔街合作有助于确保这些项目不损害环境，并确保这些项目对不同群体的影响是公平的。 这些都是好的结果。 但这些旨在牟取利润或至少收回直接成本的项目就连消除极端贫困都远远不够。 贫困国家需要拨款而非贷款，以满足医疗和教育方面的基本需求。 金应该借鉴他成功主导抗艾滋病斗争的全球健康经验，而不是只会把贫困国家淹没在债务当中。 我们需要世行积极宣传并致力引导为实现可持续发展目标筹集援助资金的工作。 为穷人提供医疗服务需要全面培训和部署社区卫生工作者，并建立诊断、药物和信息系统。 为穷人提供教育需要训练有素的教师、安全现代的教室，并连接其他学校以及在线课程。 上述可持续发展目标可以实现，但前提是必须要有明确的战略、拨款资助和明确的分配机制。 世界银行应当发展专业能力，协助捐助者和受援国政府取得这些项目的成功。 金在这方面有着丰富的经验，他知道怎样做才能实现目标。 特朗普和其他世界领袖均对可持续发展目标负有个人义务。 他们需要付出比现在多得多的努力。 全世界超富阶层也是一样，他们所掌握的财富比例从历史上来看可谓前所未有。 超级富豪已经获得了一轮又一轮的减税和特别税收优惠，他们能够轻松得到央行贷款，并在推高利润的同时获得非技术工人薪酬降低带来的巨大好处。 即使近来股票市场疲软，全球2000多位亿万富豪也拥有约10万亿美元左右的财富 — — 如果政府也能够尽其所能，这些财富足以为消除极端贫困所需的渐进式努力提供资金援助。 在访问华尔街、达沃斯或其他财富中心时，世界银行应当鼓励亿万富翁将他们激增的财富投入个人慈善，用于支持实现可持续发展目标。 比尔·盖茨正在从事这项事业，并在公共卫生领域取得了历史性的成果。 哪些亿万富翁将主导教育、可再生能源、淡水及卫生设备以及可持续农业等领域的可持续发展目标？ 凭借明确的可持续发展目标计划，世行将找到合作伙伴，协助其完成历史性且至关重要的核心任务。"

            "How World Bank Arbitrators Mugged Pakistan NEW YORK – Wall Street hedge funds and lawyers have turned an arcane procedure of international treaties into a money machine, at the cost of the world’s poorest people. The latest shakedown is a $5.9 billion award against Pakistan’s government in favor of two global mining companies – Antofagasta PLC of Chile and Barrick Gold Corporation of Canada – for a project that was never approved by Pakistan and never carried out. Here are the facts. In 1993, a US-incorporated mining company, BHP, entered into a joint venture (JV) with the Balochistan Development Authority (BDA), a public corporation in Pakistan’s impoverished Balochistan province. The JV was set up to prospect for gold and copper, and in the event of favorable discoveries, to seek a mining license. BHP was not optimistic about the project’s profitability and dragged its feet on exploration. In the early 2000s, it assigned the prospecting rights to an Australian company, which created Tethyan Copper Company (TCC) for the project. In 2006, Antofagasta acquired TCC for $167 million, and sold half to Barrick Gold. Soon after the purchase, however, the original JV agreement with BHP was challenged in Pakistan’s courts. In 2013, the Pakistan Supreme Court found that the JV’s terms violated Pakistan’s mining and contract laws in several ways and declared the agreement – and thus the rights claimed by TCC – to be null and void. Specifically, the Court ruled that the BDA did not have authority to bind Balochistan to the terms of the JV agreement; that it awarded the contract without competition or transparency; and that it had greatly exceeded its authority and violated the law by promising extensive deviations from the rules normally applicable to mining projects. Moreover, the JV failed to obtain, and even to pursue, many mandatory approvals from the state and federal governments, and BHP failed to undertake prospecting in a timely manner required under the mining law. The Supreme Court’s decision came after years of public-interest litigation challenging the deal for violations of domestic law and the rights of the public. In the meantime, the BDA’s chairman was found to have conflicts of interest and to be living beyond the means afforded by his official salary, which in the Court’s words was tantamount to corruption. In a normal world, the Court’s judgment would be respected absent proven evidence of corruption or other wrongdoing against the justices. But in the world we actually inhabit, the so-called international rule of law enables rich companies to exploit poor countries with impunity and disregard their laws and courts. When TCC lost its case in Pakistan’s Supreme Court, it simply turned to the World Bank’s International Center for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), in complete disregard of Pakistan’s laws and institutions. A panel of three arbitrators with no expertise in or respect for Pakistan’s legal system ruled that TCC deserved compensation for all future profits that it allegedly would have earned if the non-existent project, based on a voided agreement, had gone forward! Because there was no actual project, and no agreement for one, the arbitrators had no basis to say what terms – royalties, corporate taxes, environmental standards, land area, and other basic provisions – the governments of Balochistan and Pakistan would have set. In fact, disagreement on many of those terms had stalled negotiations for years. Nonetheless, the ICSID panel arbitrarily decided that TCC would have had the right to mine 1,000 square kilometers, though the mining law forbade licensing such a vast area. The arbitrators ruled that TCC would have received a tax holiday for 15 years, even though there is no evidence that such a tax holiday was in the offing – or even legal. The arbitrators decided that TCC would have benefited from a royalty rate several percentage points below the mandatory statutory rate, though there is no reason why Pakistan would have set such a low rate. The arbitrators also ruled that TCC would have met all environmental standards, or that the government would have exempted TCC from relevant requirements, though the mining area is in a desert region subject to extreme water stress, and the mining project would have demanded vast amounts of water. And the arbitrators ruled that to obtain the land needed for TCC’s pipeline, the government would have taken it from its owners and inhabitants. The arbitration ruling is utterly capricious. An illegal project, declared null and void by Pakistan’s Supreme Court and never pursued, was found by the World Bank’s arbitration panel to be worth more than $4 billion to TCC’s owners, who had paid $167 million for it in 2006. Moreover, the tribunal declared that Pakistan must compensate TCC in full, with back interest, and cover its legal fees, raising the bill to $5.9 billion, or roughly 2% of Pakistan’s GDP. It is more than twice Pakistan’s entire public spending on health care for 200 million people, in a country where 7% of children die before their fifth birthday. For many Pakistanis, the World Bank’s arbitration ruling is a death sentence. The ICSID is not an honest broker. One of the tribunal members in the TCC case is using the same expert put forward by TCC for another case in which the arbitrator is acting as counsel! When challenged about this obvious conflict of interest, the arbitrator refused to step down and the ICSID proceeded as if all were normal. Thanks to the World Bank’s arbitrators, the rich are making a fortune at the expense of poor countries. Multinational companies are feasting on unapproved, non-existent projects. Fixing the broken arbitration system should start with a reversal of the outrageous ruling against Pakistan and a thorough investigation of the flawed and corrupt process that made it possible.",
            "世界银行仲裁员莫须有抢劫巴基斯坦 纽约—华尔街对冲基金与律师们已将国际条约中的某项程序当成了一个印钞机，以世界上最穷苦的人民的生命为燃料残忍运作着。 最近，两家全球矿业公司（即智利安托法加斯塔（Antofagasta PLC of Chile）与加拿大巴里克黄金公司（Barrick Gold Corporation of Canada ） ） 针对巴基斯坦政府勒索了高达59亿美元的赔偿，而关于该赔偿所涉及到的那个项目，却是巴基斯坦官方是从未批准，也从未开展过的。 事实依据如下。 1993年，美国矿业公司必和必拓公司（BHP）与巴基斯坦贫困省份俾路支省的上市公司俾路支省发展局（BDA）合作成立了一家合资公司（joint venture; JV ） 。 双方此次合作是为勘探金矿与铜矿为目的，且在矿物含量乐观的情况下进一步申请采矿许可证。 然而，必和必拓公司对于该项目的盈利其实根本不抱乐观态度，因而拖延了勘探进度。 2000年代初，必和必拓公司将探矿权转让给了一家澳大利亚的公司，而后专门为此项目组建了TETHYAN铜业公司（Tethyan Copper Company; TCC ） 。 2006年，安托法加斯塔矿业公司（Antofagasta）以1.67亿美元收购了TETHYAN铜业公司（TCC ） ， 并将一半股份出售给了加拿大巴里克黄金公司。 然而，收购后不久，必和必拓公司（BHP）的原始合资协议受到了巴基斯坦法院的质疑。 2013年，经巴基斯坦最高法院判定，该合资公司的条款在许多方面违反了巴基斯坦采矿法与合同法，因此宣告TETHYAN铜业公司（TCC）的采矿协议无效，无权采矿。 具体地说，法院裁定俾路支省发展局（BDA）无权将合资协议与俾路支省政府相捆绑；换言之，关于这份合同，当地矿业公司完全不知情，不具备任何的透明度可言。 此外，该项目并未遵守一般采矿项目所必须遵守的法律规则，严重超出了作为矿业公司的权力范围且违背了法律。 此外，该合资公司也并未获得，甚至根本未申请所需的来自州和联邦政府的多项法律批准，而必和必拓公司（BHP）也未能依照采矿法及时开展勘探工作。 实际上，在此次最高法院的裁决的前几年，该项目就已经受到了公益诉讼，质疑采矿协议违反了国家法律与公众利益。 于此同时，法院还发现俾路支省发展局（BDA）主席涉及到多起利益冲突，且个人生活的奢侈程度大大超出了官方所发放的薪水所能给予的程度。 经法院判定，此行为属于贪污腐败。 一般情况下，即使不具备证据表明存在贪污货其它违法行为，案件一律遵从法院的判决。 然而在我们所生活的血淋淋的现实世界中，所谓的国际法律偏偏让财大气粗的企业无休止地剥削贫穷国家，同时还能免于国家法律与法院的惩罚与制裁。 TETHYAN铜业公司（TCC）于巴基斯坦最高法院败诉，而后申请了世界银行的解决投资争端国际中心（International Center for the Settlement of Investment Disputes; ICSID）进行干涉，无视巴基斯坦的法律与政府机关。 解决投资争端国际中心组成了一个三人小组，经过判定：如果巴基斯坦最高法院裁定协议无效，项目解散不存在，那么TETHYAN铜业公司（TCC）有权就未来可能获得的一切利润获得赔偿。 因为在这条件下，没有实际的项目，也没有相关协议，那么仲裁员可以宣判巴基斯坦和俾路支省政府无法对于“项目”附加任何的条款，如矿区使用费，企业税，环境保护标准，用地面积规定，以及其它基本规定。 实际上，关于此类条款的争议，解决投资争端国际中心早已拖延数年时间不去理会，如今搬上台面。 无论怎样，解决投资争端国际中心小组最终仍是蛮横地宣称TETHYAN铜业公司（TCC）有权针对该面积高达1,000平方公里的项目进行采矿工作，即使采矿法明确禁止为开采面积如此广大的矿业项目颁发许可证书。 经仲裁员判定，TETHYAN铜业公司（TCC）将获得一个长达15年的免税期，而事实是根本没有证据表明世界上竟然存在这样的一个免税期，甚至无法证明其合法性。 更甚者，仲裁员还判定，TETHYAN铜业公司（TCC）应享受优待，其矿区使用费应低于法定费率好几个百分点，也许就连巴基斯坦政府也不明白自己为什么需要给予如此惊人的优待政策吧。 解决投资争端国际中心的仲裁员还判定TETHYAN铜业公司（TCC）符合所有环境保护标准，或要么巴基斯坦政府应针对TETHYAN铜业公司（TCC）免除所有的环境保护相关要求，即使事实情况完全是该项目涉及到的采矿区域处于沙漠地带，极度缺水，而采矿项目需要大量的水资源。 对于该情况，经仲裁员规定，TETHYAN铜业公司（TCC）修建输水管道所需要的土地资源，政府应协助从土地所有者和居民处获取。 如此的仲裁裁决完全无合情理。 一个本身就不合法项目，经巴基斯坦最高法院宣判为无效，而且从未追究其责任。 而到了世界银行仲裁小组这边，却变成了一个对于TETHYAN铜业公司（TCC）的超过40亿美元的项目，前期于2006年已经投入了1.67亿美元。 此外，仲裁法庭竟判定巴基斯坦须以全额连本带利对TETHYAN铜业公司（TCC）的损失进行赔偿，甚至把仲裁所用的诉讼费也算在了里面，总金额高达59亿美元，约占巴基斯坦GDP的2 % 。 在这个国家中，有7%的孩子未能活过5岁生日，而这个数字（59亿美元）已是巴基斯坦政府在全国2亿人民身上花费的总公共医疗保健开支的两倍。 对于许多巴基斯坦人来说，世界银行这样的仲裁裁决完全等于向他们判了死刑。 解决投资争端国际中心不是一个公平光明的调解机构。 在TETHYAN铜业公司（TCC）这个案件中，其中有一名法庭成员正是该公司另一案件中所雇佣的律师，也是此次调解中的仲裁员。 当时提到明显的利益冲突时，该仲裁员是无理也不让人，而解决投资争端国际中心当然也是当利益冲突不存在似的继续执行其程序。 多亏了世界银行的大恩大德，那些富人才能以贫困国家的血肉为代价，走向辉煌的未来。 那么多跨国公司正在享受着这种未经批准，法律层面上根本不存在的项目所带来的利益。 而要使这个腐败的仲裁系统重归正义，应从撤销针对巴基斯坦的不公平裁决开始，对腐败堕落的仲裁程序进行严苛调查，才能使之成为可能。"

            "The ABCs of Doing Business NEW YORK – The World Bank’s annual Doing Business (DB) report is probably its most-cited publication. It is also the Bank’s most contentious, and with the release of Doing Business 2018 last October, the controversy surrounding the report has reached new heights, with some critics accusing it of obfuscation, data rigging, and political manipulation. I was closely involved with the DB report from 2012 to 2016, so I had to restrain myself from jumping into the debate on the topic. But now, a review of the DB index and annual report seems worthwhile. I first became familiar with the DB report when I was an adviser to the Indian government and would look to it for ideas about how to cut India’s notoriously cumbersome bureaucratic red tape. So, when I moved to the World Bank and learned that I would be overseeing the DB team, it was like a regular restaurant patron suddenly being asked to supervise the kitchen. The upshot was that I learned all that went on behind the scenes. And although I had some conceptual disagreements, I was impressed by the integrity of the process. The DB index aims to measure, across countries, the ease of starting a business, obtaining the relevant permits, accessing essential infrastructure, and so forth. It comprises ten indicators, each of which is based on various sub-indicators, and all of which are aggregated, according to a fixed rule, into a final score that determines a country’s ranking among 190 economies. According to the 2018 report, New Zealand and Singapore are the world’s best and second-best places to do business, and Eritrea and Somalia are the worst, at 189 and 190, respectively. Although there were aspects of the DB rankings that I did not like, I do not find the recent charges of data rigging to be credible. Having personally supervised much of the process, which involves a very large team compiling economic data from around the world, I can vouch for the multiple layers of checks and balances that are in place. Nevertheless, there certainly are ways to influence the rankings without cooking up data. With any big operation – whether it is the DB or an effort to measure GDP – one occasionally discovers conceptual flaws. For example, when I first took over the process, I disagreed with the prevailing assumption that a higher tax rate is necessarily worse for an economy. After all, the same logic dictates that the lower the tax rate, the better, which implies that a tax rate of zero is optimal. But that is obviously absurd. Even if one ignores the moral dimensions, a very low tax rate leaves a country more exposed to the threat of severe fiscal crises, which are a nightmare for business. Steps were taken to make some minimal corrections that would not be too disruptive. Still, recognizing such problems poses a dilemma. It is never ideal to have to change a yardstick that has been used to track changes over time; but nor is it right to rely on an assumption that one knows to be flawed. At the end of the day, it’s a judgment call. For my part, I mitigated against possible biases by not even looking at the final result until I had first decided, using abstract reasoning, which changes were essential. In this year’s DB, the two big controversies concern India’s rise and Chile’s fall. Between 2016 and 2017, India moved from 130th to 100th place. I no longer have inside information on the data, but I can see two reasons why this could occur. First, if a country is determined to move up the ranking, it can do so by focusing on the ten indicators that determine the final score, though this is not a national economic strategy that I would recommend. Second, any change in ranking can be driven either by what a country does relative to other countries, or by measurement changes that the DB may have instituted in a given year – changes like those mentioned above. For example, when India moved from 142nd to 130th place between 2014 and 2015, the DB team and I computed that only four of the 12 positions that India had climbed reflected changes India had made, with the remainder attributable to changes in the DB methodology. As for Chile, which slipped from 48th to 57th place between 2015 and 2016, and is now ranked 55th, it is worth noting that there is a lot of cheek-by-jowl competition at the higher end of the ranking. Small changes by countries that neighbor one another in the index can result in a sharp reordering. But it is also true that Chilean President Michelle Bachelet’s government has placed greater emphasis on social indicators than on economic indicators. To my mind, that is a cause for praise, not criticism. Having worked with Bachelet on the World Bank’s 2018 World Development Report on education, I know that she is that rare politician who is genuinely committed to improving social welfare. Many countries and political leaders make the mistake of equating the DB ranking with overall welfare. But the DB merely measures what it says it measures: the ease of doing business. That is certainly important for an economy, but it isn’t everything. In fact, one of the first lessons of economics is that all good things in life involve tradeoffs. It would be a pity to see more countries focusing only on “doing business” to the exclusion of other indicators of wellbeing.",
            "关于《营商环境》的基本点 纽约—世界银行年度《营商环境 》 （ Doing Business）报告也许是被援引最多的出版物。 它也是世界银行最有争议的报告，去年10月《2018年营商环境报告 》 （ Doing Business 2018）发布后，围绕该报告的争议达到了新高度，一些批评指责报告含义模糊，玩弄数据，还受到政治操纵。 我深度参与了2012—2016年间的营商报告，因此一直没有加入争论。 但如今，对营商报告指数和年报做一番评论似乎是有意义的。 我熟悉营商报告是在印度政府顾问任上，我从中寻找关于如何削减印度臭名昭著的繁文缛节和官样文章的思维。 因此，当我来到世界银行任职，并获知将领导营商报告团队时，我就像是一位突然被任命负责厨房的饭店常客。 结果是我了解到关于营商报告背后的一切。 而尽管我有一些概念上的不同见解，仍对整个过程的完整性印象深刻。 营商指数的目标是衡量各国创办企业、获得相关许可、获得必要基础设施等方面的容易程度。 它包括十个指标，每一个都基于众多次级指标。 所有次级指标根据固定规则加总后得出一个分数，决定了一国在190个国家中的排位。 根据2018年报告，新西兰和新加坡是全球排名第一和第二的营商目的地，厄立特里亚和索马里情况最遭，分列第189和190位。 尽管我不太喜欢营商环境排名中的某些指标，但我也不认为最近关于玩弄数据的指控可信。 从我个人经验出发，我负责过整个过程的大部分，其中包括一支庞大的团队负责搜集全球经济数据，我可以证明，我们有多层次的制衡机制。 尽管如此，肯定有办法再不操纵数据的情况下影响排名。 任何大操作 — — 不管是营商报告还是衡量GDP数字 — — 都会出现偶尔的概念性漏洞。 比如，我第一次主管营商报告时就有过分歧：我不同意高税率一定不利于经济的假设。 毕竟，同样的逻辑意味着税率越低越好，进而零税率最好。 但这显然是荒谬的。 即使忽略道德因素，极低的利率也让一国更加容易面临严重财政危机，而财政危机对企业来说是一场噩梦。 我们采取了一些措施，做了一些影响不会太大的小修正。 尽管如此，认识到这些问题仍然带来了一个困境。 不得不改变用于追踪随时间发生的变化的基准绝非理想情况；但依靠已知有缺陷的假设也不正确。 最终需要进行一些调整。 对我来说，我减少可能的偏见的办法是着眼于最终结果，直至我通过抽象推理做出关于必须做出哪些改变的初步决定。 在今年的营商报告中，两项较大争议是印度排名上升和智利排名下降。 2016—2017年间，印度从第130名上升至第100名。 我现在不清楚关于数据的内幕，但我认为有两个原因。 首先，如果一国决心要提高排名，可以专注于决定最终分数的十个指标，尽管我并不推荐将此作为国家经济战略。 其次，排名的变化可以由一国相对另一国做了什么决定，也可以由营商报告在某个年度所进行的衡量指标变化决定 — — 比如上文所提及的变化。 比如，2014—2015年间印度从第142名上升到第130名，期间营商报告团队和我测算，在这12个位次的攀升中，只有四个是因为印度所做出的改变，其他都可以归因为营商数据指标方法的改变。 智利则在2015—2016年间从第48名下滑到第57名，目前排在第55名。 其中值得关注的是，较高排名区间竞争非常激烈。 在排名中彼此接近的国家指标的微小变化就有可能产生剧烈的升降。 但智利总统巴切莱特政府更加强调社会指标而非经济指标也是事实。 在我看来，这值得赞扬而不是批评。 我和巴切莱特一起参与了世界银行2018年《世界发展报告 》 （ World Development Report）教育篇，深知她是那种罕见的真正致力于改善社会福利的政治家。 许多国家和政治领导人都犯了一个错误：将营商环境排名等同于总体福利。 但营商环境只衡量它明言试图衡量的东西：营商的容易程度。 这对于经济来说当然很重要，但并非全部。 事实上，经济学的第一课就教育我们，生活中的一切好东西都包含了权衡。 更多国家只关注“营商 ” ， 而不顾其他福利指标，这是令人遗憾的现象。"

            "The Bretton Woods Credibility Crisis WASHINGTON, DC – Despite setbacks like the Great Recession and the COVID-19 pandemic, the world economy has had a massively successful run since World War II. That success was underpinned by the post-war global economic system and its central institutions: the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the World Trade Organization (previously the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade). In joining the Bretton Woods institutions, countries around the world agreed to subject their economic behavior to an international rule of law. These institutions all have governing bodies with representatives from member states, as well as highly qualified technocratic staff to carry out their work. The periodic reports they produce have been essential sources of information and analyses. But one of these reports, the World Bank’s annual Doing Business index, has become the source of enormous controversy. The point of Doing Business was to report on each member state’s regulatory environment, elements of which include legal procedures, wait times, start-up costs, the efficiency of the judicial system, and the accessibility and reliability of basic utilities like electricity. These and many other factors determined each country’s overall ranking. In the 2018 report, for example, New Zealand ranked highest, and Somalia the lowest. While no measure is perfect, the procedure for determining the rankings was transparent, and the indicators in each report were as objective as possible, even if they did rely also on anecdotal evidence. The Doing Business reports were highly respected and thus widely used, not only by national policymakers as an indication of how their country’s regulations and performance compared with others’, but also by independent researchers and firms and financial institutions contemplating investments abroad. It was not uncommon for a head of government to instruct his ministers to pursue policies geared toward climbing the rankings. Many observers, including me, regarded the Doing Business reports as the World Bank’s single most important publication. The Bank published the individual results alongside the overall ranking, so anyone who questioned the weights could apply her own. While some governments instituted Potemkin reforms – all façade and no substance – there were many more instances of Doing Business-inspired policies that reduced costs and increased productivity. As with all publications from international economic institutions, Doing Business’s credibility was the key to its success. But following the 2018 report, there were complaints about the data that had been used, leading the World Bank to commission the highly regarded law firm WilmerHale to investigate. Its report, issued last month, found serious irregularities with respect to China’s ranking in the 2018 report. The investigators report that Kristalina Georgieva, the Bank’s then-CEO (second in command) who has since become managing director of the IMF, urged staff to reconsider the results for China, and then “explored … ways to change the methodology to raise China’s ranking.” The report also points out that the Bank had an interest in placating China, because it was seeking Chinese support for a capital increase at the time. All told, the investigators provided sufficient evidence of Georgieva’s involvement to raise serious doubts about Doing Business’s credibility and integrity. The current president of the World Bank, David Malpass, has suspended publication of the 2021 report and discontinued future ones. The Bank will surely examine and amend its procedures to prevent similar efforts at manipulation in the future. Credibility is essential for the critical work the IMF and World Bank do. Both employ highly respected researchers, world-class economists and statisticians, and dedicated officials. They know they are civil servants and not politicians; all are highly committed to their jobs. True, in some cases (some of which are known to me), there has been pressure at the political level to support a certain lending program or policy position. But a central part of the leadership’s job is to shield staff from undue interference in their reports and analyses. Attempting to massage the ranking for one country in a cross-country report is egregious not only because it undermines the credibility of the report but also because it harms the other countries whose rankings are changed as a result. When a country falls in the rankings, its ability to attract foreign investors and businesses can be diminished. Like Caesar’s wife, IMF and World Bank leaders must be well above suspicion in overseeing these institutions’ work and safeguarding the integrity of the data on which that work relies. Georgieva’s reported actions certainly raise serious doubts about her commitment to the integrity of the data, including in the context of her new role. If an IMF managing director is thought to be amenable to pressures to alter data and analyses, the credibility of the Fund’s work will be greatly diminished, if it is believed at all. It is one thing for the managing director to urge the Board to approve a program of questionable merit based on a report providing an honest account of the situation. It is quite another thing to pressure staff to alter the numbers. Should Georgieva remain in her position, she and her staff will surely be pressured to alter other countries’ data and rankings. And even if they resist, the reports they produce will be suspect. The entire institution’s work will be devalued. That prospect alone should be enough for the IMF’s political masters to find a new managing director whose commitment to the integrity of the work is not in question.",
            "布雷顿森林信誉危机 华盛顿—尽管经历了大衰退和新冠肺炎疫情等挫折，但二战以来世界经济仍取得了巨大成功。 这一成功植根于战后全球经济体系及其中央机构：国际货币基金组织（IMF ） 、 世界银行和世界贸易组织（前身为关税和贸易总协定 ） 。 在加入布雷顿森林机构时，世界各国同意其经济行为受国际法治约束。 这些机构都有由成员国代表组成的理事机构，开展工作的人手也都是高质量技术官僚。 他们制作的定期报告一直是信息和分析的重要来源。 但其中一份报告，即世界银行的年度营商环境指数，却成为了巨大争议的根源。 营商环境报告的重点是报告每个成员国的监管环境，其中的要素包括法律程序、等待时间、启动成本、司法系统的效率，以及电力等基本公用事业的可及性和可靠性。 这些和许多其他因素决定了每个国家的整体排名。 例如，在 2018 年的报告中，新西兰排名最高，索马里最低。 虽然没有完美的衡量标准，但确定排名的程序是透明的，每份报告中的指标都尽可能客观，即使它们确实也依赖于轶闻证据。 营商环境报告受到高度尊重，并因此被广泛使用，不仅被国家政策制定者用来表明其国家的法规和绩效与其他国家相比如何，而且还被独立研究人员和考虑进行海外投资的公司和金融机构使用。 政府首脑指示有关部门采取措施以提高营商环境报告排名的情况屡见不鲜。 许多观察者，包括我在内，都认为营商环境报告是世界银行最为重要的出版物。 世界银行将个别结果与整体排名一起发布，因此任何质疑权重的人都可以自取所需。 虽然一些政府实施了波将金改革 — — 即表面文章 — — 但还有更多通过营商环境报告所刺激的政策来降低成本和提高生产力的例子。 与国际经济机构的所有出版物一样，营商环境报告的信誉是其成功的关键。 但在 2018 年的报告之后，人们对使用的数据颇有怨言，导致世界银行委托备受推崇的WilmerHale律师事务所 进行调查。 其上个月发布的报告发现，中国在 2018 年报告中的排名存在严重违规行为。 调查人员报告说，世界银行当时的首席执行官（二把手）克里斯塔琳娜·格奥尔基耶娃（Kristalina Georgieva）敦促工作人员重新考虑中国的结果，然后“探索 … … 改变方法以提高中国的排名 ” 。 ” 报告还指出，世行有兴趣安抚中国是因为当时它正在寻求中国支持增资。 总而言之，调查人员提供了足够的证据证明格奥尔基耶娃参与其中，从而对营商环境报告的信誉和诚信提出了严重怀疑。 世界银行现任行长戴维·马尔帕斯 (David Malpass) 已叫停发布 2021 年报告，并停止发布未来的报告。 世行肯定会审查和修改其程序，以防止将来发生类似的操纵行为。 信誉是国际货币基金组织和世界银行的关键工作的基础。 两者都聘请了备受尊敬的研究人员、世界一流的经济学家和统计学家，以及敬业的官员。 他们知道自己是公务员而不是政客；所有人都高度致力于他们的工作。 确实，在某些情况下（其中一些我知道 ） ， 存在一些政治层面的压力要你支持某笔贷款项目或某个政策立场。 但领导层工作的一个核心部分是保护员工的报告和分析不受不当干扰。 试图在一份跨国报告中篡改一个国家的排名是令人震惊的，不仅因为它破坏了报告的信誉，还因为它损害了排名因此而改变的其他国家。 当一个国家的排名下降时，它吸引外国投资者和企业的能力就会减弱。 就像凯撒的妻子一样，国际货币基金组织和世界银行的领导人在监督这些机构的工作和保护这些工作所依赖的数据的诚信方面必须无可置疑。 据报的格奥尔基耶娃的行为无疑将导致人们严重质疑她对于数据诚信的承诺，包括在她履新的情况下。 如果认为国际货币基金组织总裁能够承受改动数据和分析的压力，那么该组织工作的可信度将大大降低乃至彻底破产。 总裁根据如实陈述情况的报告敦促理董事会批准一项有问题的计划是一回事。 向员工施压以改动数字是完全不同的另一回事。 如果格奥尔基耶娃不下台，她和她的工作人员一定会遇到改动其他国家数据和排名的压力。 即使他们抵抗住了这些压力，他们撰写的报告也会受到怀疑。 整个机构的工作都将因此而贬值。 光是这样的前景，就足以促使国际货币基金组织的政治主人们物色工作诚信绝无可疑的新总裁。"

            "The Right Investments to Address the Human Capital Crisis WASHINGTON, DC – For 75 years, the World Bank has been at the forefront of development, helping countries make smart investments to prepare their citizens for the future. It has been particularly focused on the poorest and most vulnerable – their access to infrastructure, health, education, assets, jobs, and markets. In recent years, it has embraced policies and investment in areas critical for the world’s future, such as combating climate change and making technology work for the poor. Everywhere I travel – from Rwanda to Zambia, or from Indonesia to my home country, Bulgaria – I see the difference that technology can make in people’s lives. The impact is apparent in a multitude of ways, such as digital payment systems or the emerging gig economy, leading to remarkable success stories. But just as technology is improving the lives of millions around the world, it is also changing the nature of work. Our 2019 World Development Report focused on how innovation is changing or doing away with existing jobs and launching entirely new fields of employment that didn’t exist a few years ago. This raises some difficult questions: What jobs are people going to do? How will they support their families? How will they fulfill their potential in an increasingly complex world? We have powerful new tools to help developing countries answer those questions. At the World Bank Group-IMF Annual Meetings in Bali in October, we launched the Human Capital Index. Initially covering 157 countries, the Index is a summary measure of the human capital that a child born today can expect to attain by age 18, given the risks of poor health and education where he or she lives. The Index focuses on outcomes in three key areas. First, survival: What is the probability that a child born today will survive to age five? Second, health: Will children be stunted before age five? Will they be healthy into adulthood, ready for work, with a foundation for lifelong learning? And third, education: How much schooling will children complete, and more importantly, how much will they learn? The Human Capital Index is unique because it focuses on productivity-linked indicators such as child survival, stunting, learning-adjusted years of school, and adult survival, and it draws a direct line between future economic growth and better health and education outcomes. Above all, it paints a clear picture for leaders of how much more productive their workers could be when they are healthy, educated, and equipped with the skills needed for a rapidly changing labor market. A country can score between 0 and 1 on the index, with 1 representing the best possible frontier of complete education and full health. In our first index, the average value for the world was just 0.56. This means that, across the 157 countries covered, children born today will grow up to be roughly half as productive as they could be. The implications for growth – and therefore poverty reduction – are enormous. If a country has a score of 0.50, its future GDP per worker could be twice as high if that country reached the frontier. Over a half-century, this works out to 1.4 percentage points of GDP growth every year. Investing in people is even more urgent because of two challenging global trends. First, global growth is slowing. Our Global Economic Prospects report, released earlier this month, is appropriately titled Darkening Skies. Global growth has moderated – in 2019, it is expected to slow to 2.9%, from 3% in 2018. And growth in emerging markets and developing economies is expected to stall at 4.2%, the same pace as in 2018. Second, the pace of poverty reduction is slowing. Our Poverty and Shared Prosperity report found that in 2015, the most recent year with robust data, extreme poverty reached 10%, the lowest level in recorded history. But the 736 million people still living in extreme poverty will be harder to reach. The poverty rate in areas suffering from fragility, conflict, and violence climbed to 36% in 2015, up from a low of 34.4% in 2011, and that share will likely increase. Investment in human capital can help drive inclusive, sustainable economic growth. But this is not just the domain of health and education ministers. Heads of state, finance ministers, CEOs, and investors need to make these investments an urgent priority. If we act now, we can create a world where all children arrive at school well-nourished and ready to learn; where they can grow up to be healthy, skilled, productive adults; and where they have a chance to fulfil their potential. The children of today deserve this future. The employers of tomorrow will demand it. The leaders of the world owe it to them to act now.",
            "解决人力资本危机的正确投资 华盛顿—75年来，世界银行一直站在发展前沿，帮助各国进行明智的投资，为公民做好面向未来的准备。 世界银行尤其注重最贫困和最脆弱群体 — — 让他们能够获得基础设施、医疗、教育、资产、就业岗位和市场。 近几年来，世界银行出台世界未来的关键领域政策和投资，如遏制气候变化、让科技为穷人服务等。 我所到之处 — — 从卢旺达到赞比亚，从印度尼西亚到我的祖国保加利亚 — — 无不目睹科技给人们的生活所带来的不同。 各方面的影响清晰可见，如数字支付系统和新兴的零工经济，可观的成功故事层出不穷。 但科技在改善全世界数百万人的生活的同时，也在改变工作的性质。 我们的2019年《世界发展报告》聚焦于创新如何改变或消灭现有岗位，又如何带来了几年前还不存在的全新的就业领域。 这引出了一些难题：人们将要去做什么工作？ 他们如何支撑起家庭？ 他们如何在日益复杂的世界中实现潜力？ 我们有强大的新工具帮助发展中国家回答这些问题。 在10月的世界银行集团-国际货币基金组织巴厘岛年会上，我们发布了人力资本指数。 该指数最初包括157个国家，是总结性的人力资本指标哦，描述了在给定了拙劣的医疗和教育条件的风险的情况下，今天出生的儿童能够预期在18岁时取得什么成就。 指数聚焦于三个关键领域的结果。 首先是生存：今天出生的儿童，活到5岁的概率是多少？ 其次是健康：5岁之前会发生营养不良吗？ 能健康地生长成人，准备好工作，并打好终身学习的基础吗？ 第三是教育：儿童能完成多少学校教育，以及，更重要的是，能学到多少东西？ 人力资本指数是独一无二的，因为它聚焦于与生产力有关的指标，如儿童生存率、营养不良、根据学力调整的教育年限，以及成年生存，其结论是未来经济增长与更好的医疗和教育结果之间存在直接关系。 最重要的是，它为领导人勾勒了一幅清晰的图景，说明了当工人能够更健康、接受更多教育，并配备迅速变化的劳动力市场所要求的技能时，生产力能够提高多少。 每个国家在指数中的得分为0到1之间，1代表最佳可能性前沿，即完整的教育和充分的医疗。 在第一项指数中，世界平均值只有0.56。 这意味着，在我们所覆盖的157个国家中，今天出生的儿童长大后只能实现他们能够实现的生产力的大约一半。 对增长的影响 — — 对减贫的影响亦然 — — 是巨大的。 如果一国分数为0.5，那么其未来每名工人所创造的GDP可能比国家达到前沿高度的情形低一半。 如果以半个世纪来衡量，这意味着全球GDP增长每年损失1.4个百分点。 拜两大全球趋势所赐，投资于人的任务变得更加紧迫。 首先，全球增长正在放缓，本月早些时候发布的我们的全球经济前景报告有一个恰如其分的标题 ： 《 暮日 》 （ Darkening Skies ） 。 全球增长有所放缓 — — 2019年预计将从2018年的3%下降至2.9 % 。 而新兴市场和发展中经济体的增长预计将停留在4.2 % ， 与2018年持平。 其次，减贫的速度在放缓。 我们的《贫困和共同繁荣》报告发现，2015年，即有鲁棒数据的最近一年，极端贫困来到了有历史记录以来的最低值10 % 。 但7.36亿人仍然生活在极端贫困中，并且更加难以触及。 饱受脆弱性、冲突和暴力影响的地区的贫困率在2015年攀升至36 % ， 而2011年的低点为34.4 % ， 并且这一比例可能会继续上升。 人力资本投资有利于推动包容的可持续经济增长。 但这绝不仅仅是卫生和教育部长的职责范围。 国家首脑、财政部长、CEO和投资者都需要将这些方面的投资列为紧急重点事项。 如果我们现在就采取行动，就能创造一个所有儿童都能以营养充分、做好学习准备的状态进入学校；所有儿童都能成长为健康、有技能、有生产力的成年人；并且所有儿童都有机会实现潜力的世界。 今天的儿童应该得到这样的未来。 明天的雇主们也将要求这一点。 这是世界领导人欠他们的，应该现在就行动起来。"

            "The Risk of a New Economic Non-Order LONDON – Next month, when finance ministers and central bank governors from more than 180 countries gather in Washington, DC, for the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, they will confront a global economic order under increasing strain. Having failed to deliver the inclusive economic prosperity of which it is capable, that order is subject to growing doubts – and mounting challenges. Barring a course correction, the risks that today’s order will yield to a world economic non-order will only intensify. The current international economic order, spearheaded by the United States and its allies in the wake of World War II, is underpinned by multilateral institutions, including the IMF and the World Bank. These institutions were designed to crystallize member countries’ obligations, and they embodied a set of best economic-policy practices that evolved into what became known as the “Washington Consensus.” That consensus was rooted in an economic paradigm that aimed to promote win-win interactions among countries, emphasizing trade liberalization, relatively unrestricted cross-border capital flows, free-market pricing, and domestic deregulation. All of this stood in stark contrast to what developed behind the Iron Curtain and in China over the first half of the postwar period. For several decades, the Western-led international order functioned well, helping to deliver prosperity and relative financial stability. Then it was shaken by a series of financial shocks that culminated in the 2008 global financial crisis, which triggered cascading economic failures that pushed the world to the edge of a devastating multi-year depression. It was the most severe economic breakdown since the Great Depression of the 1930s. But the crisis did not appear out of nowhere to challenge a healthy economic order. On the contrary, the evolution of the global order had long been outpaced by structural economic changes on the ground, with multilateral governance institutions taking too long to recognize fully the significance of financial-sector developments and their impact on the real economy, or to make adequate room for emerging economies. For example, governance structures, including voting power, correspond better to the economic realities of yesterday than to those of today and tomorrow. And nationality, rather than merit, still is the dominant guide for the appointment of these institutions’ leaders, with top positions still reserved for European and US citizens. The destabilizing consequences of this obstinate failure to reform sufficiently multilateral governance have been compounded by China’s own struggle to reconcile its domestic priorities with its global economic responsibilities as the world’s second-largest economy. Several other countries, particularly among the advanced economies, have also failed to transform their domestic policies to account for changes to economic relationships resulting from globalization, liberalization, and deregulation. As a result of all of this, the balance of winners and losers has become increasingly extreme and more difficult to manage, not just economically, but also politically and socially. With too many people feeling marginalized, forgotten, and dispossessed – and angry at the leaders and institutions that have allowed this to happen – domestic policy pressure has intensified, causing countries to turn inward. This tendency is reflected in recent challenges to several features of the economic order, such as the North American Free-Trade Agreement, as well as America’s withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the United Kingdom’s renunciation of European Union membership. All are casting a shadow on the future of the global economic system. America’s inward turn, already underway for several years, has been particularly consequential, because it leaves the world order without a main conductor. With no other country or group of countries anywhere close to being in a position to carry the baton, the emergence of what the political scientist Ian Bremmer has called a “G-Zero era” becomes a lot more probable. China is responding to the global system’s weakening core by accelerating its efforts to build small networks, including around the traditional Western-dominated power structures. This has included the establishment of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the proliferation of bilateral payments agreements, and the pursuit of the “Belt and Road Initiative” to build infrastructure linking China with western Asia, Europe, and Africa. These dynamics are stoking trade tensions and raising the risk of economic fragmentation. If this trend continues, the global economic and financial configuration will become increasingly unstable, amplifying geopolitical and security threats at a time when better cross-border coordination is vital to address threats from non-state actors and disruptive regimes, such as North Korea. Over time, the risks associated with this shift toward a global economic non-order could have severe adverse effects on geopolitics and national security. None of this is new. Yet, year after year, top government officials at the IMF/World Bank annual meetings fail to address it. This year is likely to be no different. Instead of discussing concrete steps to slow and reverse the march toward a global economic non-order, officials will probably welcome the cyclical uptick in global growth and urge member countries to do more to remove structural impediments to faster, more durable, and more inclusive growth. While understandable, that isn’t good enough. The upcoming meetings offer a critical opportunity to start a serious discussion of how to arrest the lose-lose dynamics that have been gaining traction in the global economy. The longer it takes for the seeds of reform to be sown, the less likely they will be to take root – and the higher the probability that a lose-lose world economic non-order will emerge.",
            "新经济无序的风险 伦敦—下个月，180多个国家的财政部长和央行官员将齐聚华盛顿，参加国际货币基金组织（IMF）和世界银行峰会。 他们面临着一个日益吃紧的全球经济秩序。 这一秩序没能带来它有能力实现的包容经济繁荣，正在受到越来越多的质疑和挑战。 如果不予以纠正的话，现有秩序导致世界经济失序的风险还会继续增加。 当前的国际经济秩序由美国及其盟友在二战后引领，其基础是包括IMF和世界银行在内的多边机构。 这些机构设立的初衷是为了明确成员国的义务，它们也包含了一系列最佳经济政策实践，即日后著名的“华盛顿共识 ” 。 这一共识植根于一个旨在促进各国间双赢互动的经济范式，它强调贸易自由化、相对不受限制的跨境资本流、自由市场定价以及国内去监管化。 所有这些都与铁幕之后的国家和中国在战后时期上半段的做法截然不同。 几十年来，西方领导的国际秩序运转良好，帮助实现了繁荣和相对金融稳定。 接着，它遭遇了一系列金融冲击，2008年全球金融危机为其高潮，它触发了一连串经济失灵，让世界几乎跌入灾难性的多年萧条。 这是自20世纪30年代大萧条以来最严重的经济倒退。 但这场危机并不是无中生有冒出来挑战健康的经济秩序的。 相反，全球秩序的演化一直落后于结构性经济变化，多边治理机构充分认识金融业的发展及其对实体经济的影响消耗了太长时间，为新兴经济体创造足够空间的动作也过于缓慢。 比如，包括投票权在内的治理结构更适合过去的经济现实，但已与今天和未来的经济现实不甚相容。 国籍，而不是资质，仍然是任命这些机构领导者的主要原则，最高职位被欧洲和美国公民垄断。 顽固地不肯充改革多边治理所造成的动摇性后果，因为中国难以调和其国内重点和身为世界第二大经济体的全球经济责任而加剧。 其他一些国家，特别是经济发达国家，也没能转变国内政策以顾及全球化、自由化和去监管化所导致的经济关系变化。 拜所有这些因素所赐，赢家和输家的平衡变得更加极端和难以管理，不仅经济上是如此，政治和社会上也是如此。 太多的人感到被边缘化，被遗忘，被剥夺 — — 对放任这些情况发生的领导人和机构充满了愤怒 — — 国内政策压力也随之日益加剧，导致各国不得不向内转。 这一趋势体现为最近经济秩序的某些标志（如北美自由贸易协定）受到挑战，以及美国从跨太平洋合作伙伴关系中退出、英国放弃欧盟成员国资格等。 所有这些都给全球经济体系的未来蒙上了一层阴影。 美国的向内转已经进行了多年，其影响尤其重大，因为这导致世界秩序失去了舵手。 其他国家或国家集团都无法接过美国的接力棒，政治学家伊恩·布雷默（Ian Bremmer）所谓的“G-0时代”的出现已是板上钉钉。 面对全球体系核心的衰落，中国的应对之道是加快构建小网络的步伐，包括在传统的西方主导的权力结构之外另起炉灶。 其中包括建立亚洲基础设施投资银行、各种双边支付协定的涌现，以及推出“一带一路计划”建设连接中国和西亚、欧洲和非洲的基础设施。 这些动态助长着贸易紧张，也提高了经济分裂的风险。 如果这一趋势继续下去，全球经济和金融格局将越来越不稳定，加剧地缘和安全威胁，而与此同时，加强跨境合作才是解决来自非国家行动方和破坏性政权（如朝鲜）的威胁的关键。 假以时日，伴随向全球经济无序的转变所产生的风险可能给地缘政治和国家安全造成严重的消极影响。 所有这些都不是新鲜事。 但是，年复一年，参加IMF/世界银行年会的政府高官们都无法解决它们。 今年预计也不会有什么不同。 官员们不会讨论延缓和扭转通往全球经济无序的进程，更有可能因为全球增长的周期性好转而欢欣鼓舞，敦促成员国加大力度克服结构性障碍，构建更快、更持久、更包容的增长。 这一点可以理解，但不够好。 即将到来的会议是一次关键的机会，开启关于如何扭转在全球经济中势头渐猛的双输动态的严肃讨论。 改革种子撒播的越晚，它们深根发芽的可能性就越小，而出现双输的世界经济经济无序局面的概率就越大。"

            "The Leader the World Bank Needs ITHACA/WASHINGTON, DC – Jim Yong Kim’s sudden resignation as president of the World Bank Group (WBG) offers an opportunity to reflect on the direction, legitimacy, and effectiveness of that 75-year old institution. Like other multilateral institutions, the Bank in recent years has been criticized for its elitism and for championing outmoded models of economic globalization that have failed to deliver broad-based benefits. It has also become another staging ground for the geopolitical great-power rivalry between the United States and China. Recognizing this, finance ministers and central bank governors from the G20 established a commission in April 2017 to recommend reforms to the global financial architecture and the international financial institutions. And at a G20 meeting in October 2018, the commission issued a report outlining steps “to create a cooperative international order for a world that has changed irreversibly.” The proper mission of multilateral development finance institutions is to help solve urgent, large-scale problems in the developing world. For example, we are currently witnessing the largest urban expansion in history, and managing it will require a doubling of the global infrastructure stock within the next 15 years. Multilateral institutions also have a role to play in addressing the great expansion of Africa’s population, and in laying the foundation for sustainable, decarbonized economic growth across the developing world. Failing that, the world should expect to see more migration, unemployment, frustration, and anger in the years ahead. This is the context in which the next WBG president will be selected. Not surprisingly, the organization’s Board of Executive Directors hopes to find a candidate who is capable of effective leadership and management, with a compelling vision, a commitment to multilateralism, and diplomatic communication skills (read: “politically savvy”). The candidate should be prepared to implement already agreed strategies, embodied in the WBG’s previously published “Forward Look” and the “Sustainable Financing” papers. But the most important criterion, in our view, is that the candidate should embrace the WBG’s mission in all of its ambition and scale, and follow through on the recommendations in the recent G20 report. The WBG president’s job was redefined in 2017, with the introduction of a Chief Executive Officer. Under this new arrangement, the president should be freed up to focus on strategy (for example, how best to deploy a recent capital increase), Board relations, and partnerships. In the absence of a standard leadership-selection process, multilateral institutions have developed their own methods over time. For example, the Inter-American Development Bank has a double majority system, whereby the winning candidate must gain a majority of shareholder votes, as well as an absolute majority of votes from regional governors. In the United Nations, the General Assembly selects the secretary-general on the recommendation of the Security Council. For the newly created Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the president must receive 75% of the votes. In each case, the process is designed to give the world’s major powers their due say, while preventing any country from dominating the agenda entirely, thereby maintaining the spirit of multilateralism. At the WBG, however, the winning candidate simply has to get the most votes. Practically speaking, the president has always been an American, thanks to an informal bargain between the United States and Europe, whereby the Europeans back the WBG candidate favored by the US, while the US supports a European to lead the International Monetary Fund (which has a similar simple-majority voting system). To be sure, the US cannot veto a candidate for WBG president (as it can with a candidate for UN secretary-general). But it would be foolhardy for any candidate to campaign without at least an implicit US endorsement. This leaves a range of options for choosing the next WBG president. The US could select an American who appeals to other countries: Kim, for example, touted his Korean origins during his 2012 campaign for the post. It could select a dual national or an immigrant, such as former WBG President James Wolfensohn, an Australian who became a US citizen. Or it could back a non-American candidate from an allied country. What is important is that the nominee enjoys the trust of the US and most other countries, and can reconcile countries’ diverse interests in a true spirit of multilateralism. Nationality, per se, is not a prerequisite. But gaining the support of other countries is just one requirement. The successful candidate should also have support from other stakeholders. At the UN, candidates publish vision statements and responses to questions from civil-society organizations, and participate in a global town hall event. A WBG presidential candidate should embrace such transparency and extend it to businesses and academia, in keeping with the institution’s commitment to empiricism and fact-based solutions. When the Board selects Kim’s successor in April, we hope it does so in a way that contributes to the institution’s legitimacy and effectiveness. The WBG needs a trusted leader who understands the urgency and scope of the organization’s mission. In fact, the WBG has never had a female president. There’s no better time than now to usher in fundamental change.",
            "世界银行所需要的领袖 发自伊萨卡/华盛顿特区 — — 世界银行行长金墉（Jim Yong Kim）的突然辞职为这家拥有75年历史的机构提供了一个反思其方向，合法性和有效性的机会。 与其他多边机构一样，近年来世界银行因其精英主义以及对未能带来广泛利益的过时经济全球化模式的推崇而饱受抨击。 同时它也成为了另一个美中地缘政治大国竞争的舞台。 有鉴于此，G20集团的财政部长和央行行长于2017年4月成立了一个委员会，旨在为全球金融架构和国际金融机构提供改革建议。 在2018年10月举行的20国集团会议上，委员会发布了一份报告，概述了“为一个已经不可逆转地改变了的世界建立合作性国际秩序”的各项步骤。 多边开发金融机构的正确使命是帮助解决发展中国家存在的大范围迫切性问题。 例如我们当前正见证着史上最大规模的城市扩张，而管理这些城市需要在未来15年内将全球基础设施存量增加一倍。 多边机构在应对非洲人口大规模扩张以及为发展中国家可持续的脱碳经济增长奠定基础方面也发挥了作用。 如果没有这些举措，世界在未来只会看到更多的流民，失业，挫折和愤怒。 这就是甄选下一届世界银行行长的背景。 世界银行执行董事会显然希望能找到一位能够进行有效领导和管理的候选人，且具备有令人信服的愿景，对多边主义的承诺以及外交沟通技巧（潜台词 ： “ 极具政治手腕 ” ） 。 候选人应准备好实施那些体现在世界银行此前发布的《前瞻》和《可持续融资》文件中的既定战略。 但我们认为，最重要的候选标准是候选人应全盘接受 — — 无论是在志向还是规模上 — — 世界银行集团的使命，并遵循最近这份G20报告中的建议。 世界银行行长的工作已经在2017年得到重新定义，并引入了首席执行官一职。 根据这一新安排，行长应该被解放出来，使其更加专注于战略（例如如何最好地部署最近的增资 ） ， 董事会关系和合作伙伴关系。 在缺乏标准领导人选拔过程的情况下，各多边机构会随着时间的推移而逐渐形成自己的一套方法。 比如美洲开发银行就使用双重多数制，即获胜候选人必须获得大多数股东支持，并获得区域行长的绝对多数票。 联合国大会则根据安全理事会的建议选举秘书长。 对于新成立的亚洲基础设施投资银行，行长必须赢得75％的选票方能上台。 在上述情况下，这一程序旨在赋予世界各主要势力适当的发言权，同时防止任何国家完全支配议程，从而保持多边主义精神。 但在世界银行，候选人只要获得最多的选票就能当选。 实际上在美国和欧洲之间的桌底交易下行长一直由美国人担任，欧洲会支持美国青睐的世界银行候选人，而美国则反过来支持欧洲领导国际货币基金组织（使用类似的简单多数投票体系 ） 。 可以肯定的是，美国不能否决世界银行行长候选人（但可以否决联合国秘书长候选人 ） 。 但没有任何候选人会冒失到在一丁点美国暗示性支持都没有的情况下参选。 这为下一任世界银行行长人选留下了一系列选项。 美国可以选择一位能讨好其他国家的美国人：例如金墉就在2012年的竞选活动中不断提及自己的韩国血统。 它也可以选择持双重国籍者或移民，例如前世界银行行长詹姆斯·沃尔芬森（James Wolfensohn）就一位成为美国公民的澳大利亚人。 或者它可以支持来自盟国的非美国候选人。 而重点在于被提名者要享有美国和大多数其他国家的信任，并能够以真正的多边主义精神去调和各国之间的不同利益。 国籍本身并不是先决条件。 但获得其他国家的支持只是其中一个要求。 成功的候选人也应得到其他利益相关者的支持。 在联合国，各候选人会发表愿景演说并回答民间社会组织提出的问题，并参加全球市政厅活动。 一位世界银行行长候选人应该接受这种透明度并将其扩展到企业和学术界，以符合该机构对实证主义和基于事实的解决方案的承诺。 当世界银行执行董事会在4月份选择金的继任者时，我们希望它能够以一种有助于提升该机构合法性和有效性的方式去执行。 世界银行需要一位了解本组织使命的紧迫性和广泛性的可靠领导人。 事实上，世界银行从未有过女行长。 而现在也是引领根本性变革的最佳时机。"

            "Money Alone Won’t Ensure Global Vaccine Equity NEW YORK – In March, South Sudan received its first batch of COVID-19 vaccines. While that is good news, it came almost four months after the first doses were administered in the United Kingdom, highlighting the wide disparities in global vaccine distribution. If these gaps are not narrowed soon – with international bodies leading a transparent and equitable global vaccine rollout – the entire pandemic response will be compromised. South Sudan received its doses thanks to the COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access (COVAX) facility, which has been at the forefront of efforts to ensure equitable access to COVID-19 tests, treatments, and vaccines worldwide. Institutions like the World Health Organization, the World Bank, and UNICEF have supported these efforts. But rich countries are hampering progress by continuing to hoard supplies. In the United States, more than 2.1 million doses are being administered per day; South Sudan has administered around 1,000 vaccines in total. Overall, residents of high- and middle-income countries have received 83% of the 1.2 billion vaccine doses delivered so far. In fact, the combination of export bans, hoarding, and supply shortages has meant that COVAX has so far managed to deliver only one in five of the Oxford-AstraZeneca doses that were supposed to arrive in countries by the end of this month. At this rate, advanced economies will be able to vaccinate their entire populations before many low-income countries even begin their vaccine rollout. To accelerate progress, international development banks have committed considerable funding to help poor countries purchase and distribute vaccines, tests, and treatments. The World Bank alone has promised to contribute $12 billion. But the details of its pledge are getting lost, raising the risk that this much-needed money will be wasted for lack of scrutiny. For starters, the World Bank has yet to clarify how it will use its market power to ensure that doses remain affordable. But as vaccine producers such as Johnson & Johnson back away from their pledges to make vaccines available on a not-for-profit basis, such intervention is becoming urgent. The three US pharmaceutical firms with approved vaccines – Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson – have already shared with investors plans to raise vaccine prices in the near future. In making $12 billion available for vaccine procurement and deployment, it remains unclear what steps the World Bank is taking to make vaccine manufacturers share the technology and know-how to ramp up global production. Furthermore, the World Bank is still struggling to explain how it plans to ensure that its expenditure is transparent, or ensure that countries abide by plans to get vaccines to priority populations. As the World Bank well knows, poor program design and flawed vaccine rollouts can lead to exorbitant costs and unfair outcomes. The first World Bank-financed COVID-19 vaccine-procurement operation, launched in Lebanon in January, was nearly suspended within a month of its launch because politicians were cutting in front of higher-priority individuals, such as health workers. Transparency is vital to limit such behaviors, but the World Bank may be setting itself up for more of the same: it recently approved a project in Ethiopia, where similar queue-jumping is a known risk. It has also approved a project in Tunisia, where vaccine hesitancy and skepticism, and disinformation efforts, are substantial – factors that can further undermine a program’s efficiency, if not addressed effectively. These projects are being designed at rapid speed. Too often, however, World Bank teams – whether at the Bank’s headquarters in Washington, DC, or in the countries seeking funds – are developing these vaccine programs without input from all essential stakeholders. If groups at risk of being excluded from the vaccine rollouts are not involved in project design and monitoring, it will become all the more likely that they will be left behind. Such groups include refugees, prisoners, and people living in slums and other overcrowded conditions. In Greece, for example, more than 70,000 asylum-seekers are being excluded from the national vaccination program. Persecuted minorities, such as Myanmar’s Rohingya population and India’s Dalits (the lowest-ranked group in the country’s caste system), are also at high risk of being overlooked. And coordination in conflict zones, such as in Syria, may pose a challenge, with governments potentially even ignoring people in these territories. In-country vaccination programs must include clear protections for the most vulnerable groups, with the World Bank using its leverage to prevent discrimination in the implementation of its projects. Any vaccine funding must be made contingent on its fair and safe distribution. Moreover, there must be supervision and monitoring of these projects, as the Bank’s own board recently urged. For this to work, the World Bank must engage directly with marginalized groups. Their perspectives are essential to determine how best to spend the pledged funds and to ensure accountability by challenging misuse of resources and misallocation of vaccine doses. The global vaccine rollout is a critical test for an institution whose stated mission is to “end extreme poverty and advance shared prosperity.” Fortunately, there is reason to hope that the World Bank will pass. Its president, David Malpass, has called the COVID-19 crisis a “pandemic of inequality,” one of its hallmarks being unequal access to vaccines. But simply throwing money at the problem will not be enough to solve it. Only a transparent, inclusive, and well-designed strategy that explicitly protects the interests of the most vulnerable and gives them a way to sound the alarm when things go wrong can do that. That would be money well spent.",
            "单靠金钱无法确保全球疫苗平等 纽约—今年3月，南苏丹收到了 第一批 新冠疫苗。 虽然这是个好消息，但比英国接种第一剂疫苗晚了近四个月，突显出全球疫苗分配的差距。 如果不尽快缩小这些差距 — — 由国际机构领导一个透明平等的全球疫苗推广计划 — — 那么整体疫情应对都将受到损害。 南苏丹能够获得疫苗是因为 新冠疫苗全球获取 （COVAX）便利，该便利是确保全世界公平获得新冠测试、治疗和疫苗的前沿。 世界卫生组织、世界银行和联合国儿童基金会等机构都支持这些措施。 但富裕国家继续 囤积疫苗，阻碍了进展。 在美国，每日疫苗接种数量 超过210万剂；而南苏丹总共只接种了1000剂疫苗。 总体而言，中高收入国家的居民获得了迄今为止接种的12亿剂疫苗中的 83 % 。 事实上，出口禁令、囤积和供应短缺的结合意味着，COVAX迄今只成功交付了 本应在本月底之前运抵各国的牛津-阿斯利康疫苗数量的五分之一。 以这个速度，许多低收入国家还没有开始推广疫苗之前，发达经济体便能实现全民接种。 为了加快进展，国际开发银行已承诺提供大量资金，帮助穷国购买和分发疫苗、检测和治疗。 仅世界银行就承诺捐款 120亿美元。 但其承诺的细节我们无从知晓，这意味着这笔急需的资金可能因为缺乏监督而被浪费。 首先，世界银行尚未澄清它将如何利用其市场力量确保疫苗廉价。 但随着强生等疫苗生产商背离了以非营利形式提供疫苗的承诺，这种干预正变得紧迫起来。 拥有获批疫苗的三家美国制药公司 — — 辉瑞、摩德纳（Moderna）和强生 — — 已经 与投资者分享了 近期提高疫苗价格的计划。 对于如何让120亿美元用于疫苗采购和部署，目前还不清楚世界银行正在采取什么措施，让疫苗制造商分享技术和知识，以增加全球产量。 此外，世界银行仍在忙于解释它计划如何确保其支出透明，或确保各国遵守向优先人群接种疫苗的计划。 世界银行很清楚，糟糕的项目设计和有缺陷的疫苗推广可能导致高昂的成本和不公平的结果。 今年1月在黎巴嫩启动的首个世界银行资助的新冠疫苗采购行动，在启动后一个月内几乎暂停，因为政客们插在了卫生工作者等高优先级个人前先接种。 透明度对于限制此类行为至关重要，但世界银行可能在重蹈覆辙：它最近批准了 埃塞俄比亚的一个项目，而在埃塞俄比亚，类似的插队是众所周知 的风险。 它还批准了突尼斯的一个项目，而在突尼斯，疫苗犹豫和怀疑以及谣言非常猖獗 — — 这些因素如果不加以有效解决，将进一步削弱计划的效果。 制定这些项目的速度很快。 然而，世界银行的团队 — — 无论是在世行位于华盛顿特区的总部，还是在寻求资金的国家 — — 往往没有在所有重要利益相关者都投入的情况下制定这些疫苗计划。 如果可能被排除在疫苗推广之外的群体不参与项目设计和监测，便几乎肯定会被抛在后面。 这些群体包括难民、囚犯和生活在贫民窟和其他拥挤条件下的人。 例如，在希腊，70000多名寻求庇护者 被排除在 国家疫苗接种方案之外。 受迫害的少数民族，如缅甸的罗兴亚人和印度的达利特人（该国种姓制度中排名最低的群体 ） ， 也极有可能被忽视。 冲突地区（如叙利亚）的协调也是一个问题，政府甚至可能完全忽视这些地区的人民。 国内疫苗接种方案必须包括明确保护最脆弱群体，世界银行可利用其杠杆防止其项目执行中发生歧视。 任何疫苗资金都必须以公平和安全的分配为条件。 此外，正如世行董事会 最近所敦促的那样，必须对这些项目进行监督和监控。 要使这项工作发挥作用，世界银行必须直接与边缘化群体接触。 他们的观点对于确定如何最好地使用认捐资金，以及如何通过质疑滥用资源和疫苗剂量分配不当来确保问责至关重要。 全球疫苗推广对于一个 宣誓 要\"结束极端贫困，促进共同繁荣\"的机构来说是一个严峻的考验。 幸运的是，我们有理由希望世界银行能够通过这一考验。 世界银行行长 大卫·马尔帕斯（David Malpass）称 新冠危机是“一场叫作不平等的温疫 ” ， 其最大特点之一便是疫苗获取机会不平等。 但是，仅仅向这个问题扔钱是不足以解决它的。 只有透明、包容、精心地设计战略，明确保护最脆弱群体的利益，并让他们在出现问题时发出警报，才能做到这一点。 那才叫作把钱花在了刀刃上。"

            "Poverty Beyond the Numbers ASUNCIÓN – What is poverty? For decades, we have defined it with a number, which the World Bank currently puts at a personal income of less than $1.90 per day. But a single number fails to capture the complexity of poverty. Measuring more than just income is essential to understanding the needs of poor people and delivering optimal assistance. As the World Bank convenes its Spring Meetings in Washington, DC next week, we have an opportunity to set benchmarks that include social and environmental dimensions of poverty. The Bank has acknowledged that more than income should be considered, and recently established a Commission on Global Poverty to recommend additional metrics. Although many public and private groups already collect data on a range of issues affecting poor communities such as nutrition, maternal health, or access to education, such information remains largely untapped and is rarely shared across institutions. But there are some beacons of light, including the Social Progress Index, which provides a framework for tracking multiple symptoms of poverty across countries and complements traditional income-based measures. When we rely on a single number to measure poverty, we misdiagnose the needs of poor people. In my home country, Paraguay, I work with one of the country’s largest social enterprises, Fundación Paraguaya, to provide microfinance, education, and training to thousands of our poorest citizens. We look at 50 metrics across six dimensions of poverty, including income, housing, education, and infrastructure. One of our clients, Doña Mercedes, is now a successful micro-entrepreneur from a rural community not far from the capital city of Asunción. When she first started with Fundación Paraguaya, she was sharing a single-bedroom home with 16 other family members and cooking meals on a small fire pit on the dirt floor. Now she has a cement floor, a brick house, a separate kitchen, and around $500 in personal savings. By using Fundación Paraguaya’s self-evaluation on poverty, she was able to understand her own needs better and address them one at time. While traditional approaches focus largely on estimating the sources of household expenses and income, the Fundación Paraguaya self-evaluation helped Doña Mercedes break down her needs into 50 discrete areas that she could work on, piece by piece, and monitor over time. For example, she self-evaluated the state of her bathroom and kitchen, the quality of the food eaten at home, the family’s dental health, the number of separate bedrooms in the house, and even her self-esteem and decision-making capacity. A simple poverty map helps her track her progress by using the colors of the stoplight, red, yellow, and green, and highlight her priority areas. Next she plans to add two more bedrooms to her house and to work on enlarging her business. Fundación Paraguaya has been able to replicate this type of success in other parts of the world. In Tanzania, where I worked for three years in rural communities, we helped villages in the Southern Highlands adapt our poverty indicators to the local context in order to tackle water, sanitation, and electrification needs. Similar efforts are being deployed in South Africa, Nigeria, Uganda, China, and beyond. We could make even more progress with public-sector support. Fundación Paraguaya collects rich data across multiple dimensions, tracking more than 8,700 families each year in Paraguay alone. If this information were to reach the government of Paraguay – which has its own methods for collecting data – we could identify pockets of poverty sooner and customize programs to help each family. Because the information is self-reported, this sort of collaboration could deliver targeted aid and highlight specific public services that are needed. Moreover, if the World Bank’s Commission on Global Poverty adopts multidimensional poverty measures, it will spur other organizations to produce and share more detailed poverty data. That will give aid workers a more comprehensive poverty map of the world, helping to boost the effectiveness of anti-poverty efforts everywhere. It won’t be easy to choose which measures to include, or even how to set universal yardsticks; but even adopting a few basic ones would spur progress. For too long, one-dimensional measures such as the $1.90 per day guideline have misdiagnosed poor people’s problems – and more importantly, their causes. We know that the $1.90 per day benchmark does not fully capture the struggles of poor people in places such as Paraguay. Fortunately, the World Bank now appears to recognize the limits of its income-based indicator. Ensuring that the right type of aid reaches those most in need in a timely and effective manner requires development policymakers to embrace the type of multidimensional poverty data that aid organizations like Fundación Paraguaya have learned to gather.",
            "数字之外的贫困 亚松森—什么是贫困？ 几十年来，我们用数字来给它定义，世界银行目前的标准是个人收入低于每天1.90美元。 但一个数字是无法捕捉到贫困的复杂性的。 用收入以外的指标进行衡量对于理解穷人的需要和给予最优援助至关重要。 下周，世界银行将在华盛顿召开春季会议，我们有机会设定包含贫困的社会和环境因素在内的基准。 世界银行承认应该考虑收入之外的指标，并在最近成立了全球贫困委员会推荐增加的指标。 尽管众多公共和私人团体已经开始收集影响贫困社区的一系列问题的数据，如营养、母婴健康、教育普及度等，但这些信息仍然没有得到充分利用，并很少在机构间共享。 但也有一些希望之光，如社会进步指数提供了一个追踪不同国家多种贫困指标的框架，可以补充传统的基于收入的指标。 当我们依靠一个数字来衡量贫困时，我们误判了穷人的需要。 在我的祖国巴拉圭，我与我国最大的社会机构之一巴拉圭基金会（Fundación Paraguaya）合作为成千上万最贫穷巴拉圭公民提供微金融、教育和培训。 我们着眼于六个贫困维度的50个指标，包括收入、住房、教育和基础设施。 我们的客户之一唐娜·梅赛德斯（Doña Mercedes）现在是一位成功的微企业家，她出身于距离首都亚松桑不远的农村社区。 当她从巴拉圭基金会起步时，她与16位其他家庭成员共享一个单间，在泥土地板上支起一个小火炉做饭。 现在她有了水泥地板、砖瓦房和独立厨房，还有500美元个人储蓄。 通过使用巴拉圭基金会的贫困自我评估，她得以逐一认识和解决自身需要。 传统方法主要专注于估计家庭支出和收入源，而巴拉圭基金会的自我评估帮助唐娜·梅赛德斯将她的需要分解为50个具体的部分，让她可以逐步逐个努力解决���并随时监控效果。 比如，她自我评估了卫生间和厨房状态、在家吃的食物的质量、家庭的牙齿健康、房子中独立卧室的数量，甚至她的自尊心和决策能力。 一张简单的贫困地图通过信号灯的颜色 — — 红、黄、绿以及将重点区域高亮显示帮助她追踪自己的进步。 接着，她计划为房子增加两个卧室并致力于拓展生意。 巴拉圭基金会能够在世界其他地区复制这一类型的成功。 我在坦桑尼亚农村社区工作了三年，帮助南方高地（Southern Highlands）的村庄根据本地环境采取我们的贫困指标解决水、卫生和电气化需求。 南非、尼日利亚、乌干达、中国和其他国家也进行了类似的努力。 如果有公共部门的支持，我们可以取得更大的进步。 巴拉圭基金会收集了各个维度的丰富数据，光是在巴拉圭每年就要追踪8,700多户家庭。 如果这一信息可以为巴拉圭政府所用 — — 它有其自身的收集数据方法 — — 我们可以更快确定贫困区域，为每户家庭制定个性化的帮助计划。 由于信息为自我报告，这类合作能够实现定向援助，突显出所需要的具体的公共服务。 此外，如果世界银行全球贫困委员会采取多维度贫困衡量指标，将刺激其他组织收集和共享更加详细的贫困数据。 这将让援助工作者获得更加全面的世界贫困地图，有助于提高世界各地扶贫措施的效果。 要决定选择纳入那些指标绝非易事，甚至决定如何制定通用标准也不容易；但即使是采用一些最基本的指标也能刺激进步。 长期以来，每天1.90美元这样的一维指标误导我们对穷人的问题 — — 以及更重要的，问题的根源的认识。 我们知道，每天1.90美元的基准不能充分抓住巴拉圭等地区穷人的潦倒状况。 幸运的是，如今世界银行似乎认识到其基于收入的指标的局限性。 确保正确的援助类型及时高效地到达最需要的人需要发展政策制定者采用巴拉圭基金会等组织已经学会收集的多维贫困数据类型。"

            "The High Cost of “De-Risking” Infrastructure Finance OTTAWA – The World Bank and other multilateral institutions are increasingly promoting measures to “de-risk” infrastructure investments in developing countries, in order to make such projects more attractive for international finance. But “de-risking” is a misnomer: any project can be set back by external events, poor design, or mismanagement. At least some level of risk – whether stemming from human error and institutional weakness, or from earthquakes, hurricanes, and countless other sources – is inherent in all infrastructure investments. So the question is not how to eliminate risk, but rather how to allocate it between participating parties. When the World Bank and others talk about de-risking infrastructure finance, they really mean reducing the risk for investors – and increasing the risk for governments. The proposed risk-allocation provisions for public-private partnerships contained in the World Bank’s Guidance on PPP Contractual Provisions, 2017 Edition take this approach to a new extreme. In almost any contingency – from “force majeure” to performance failures on the part of the private party – the public party is directed to assume all or a significant part of the risk. Moreover, the Bank’s metric for determining the effectiveness of this unyielding approach is “successfully procured PPP transactions.” Missing is any measure of whether a project is actually providing the intended goods or services to citizens, and any mechanism for recourse if it is not. This extreme approach to risk allocation could have far-reaching consequences. A major reason why governments use PPPs in infrastructure is so that they can list such projects as “off-book.” That means the financing of the project is neither counted as a direct government capital expense nor applied against government debt ceilings. And because a project’s costs are supposed to be paid out over time through direct user fees or operational funds furnished by the government, the capital expenditure is regarded as “free money” that governments need not account for. But financial institutions such as the International Monetary Fund are now pushing back against this notion of “free money,” by pointing out that the higher the risk for a government, the less a project can be defined as “off-book.” Accordingly, the World Bank’s lopsided risk-allocation provisions should actually make it more likely that PPP projects will have to be categorized as on-book financing and debt. That would be a good thing in itself. By listing all infrastructure projects as on-book, governments will be in a better position to test whether they are delivering real value for money. The problem is that these discussions are all happening behind the scenes. In the meantime, the World Bank has continued to promote PPPs as the only acceptable form of infrastructure financing for developing countries in cases where a private party can do the job. And governments have continued to accumulate ever more risk, on the assumption that it is off-book and thus not counted as a sovereign-debt obligation. As a result, many developing countries are now heading for a doomsday scenario. The risks that governments have taken on will last 20-30 years in many cases. During that time, governments will face severe challenges in managing public expenditures, and they will incur unforeseen costs related to off-book commitments and excessive debt, raising the possibility of a default on all credit commitments. Making matters worse, the World Bank’s current approach creates moral hazard: the less risk the private party in a PPP assumes, the less it has to lose from poor performance. The Bank’s guidance provisions stipulate that even a private-sector partner that has failed to deliver must be compensated in order for a government to terminate the contract. As a result, some private-sector contractors may not assume that they have to perform well; instead, they may constantly weigh the costs and benefits of doing mediocre or poor-quality work. The current approach is also an open invitation for private parties to squeeze governments even further, by renegotiating active contracts. Faced with absorbing the full costs of a failed project or paying more to ensure that it succeeds, a government has little choice but to accede to a private-sector partner’s demands. This is not a far-fetched risk. The World Bank and others have understood for years that private companies frequently initiate contract renegotiations in PPP infrastructure projects. And this is even more likely to happen when contracts are awarded in a context of imperfect competition, which creates opportunities for private companies to set unrealistic contract terms. No doubt, the World Bank has good intentions. But pushing all of the risk onto governments is not the way to attract investment in developing countries. The Bank urgently needs to reverse course. That means promoting balanced risk allocations and ensuring that all infrastructure projects are assessed as if they were on-book. Guidance that is blind to its own consequences is not helpful. And when it is offered to developing countries that already have unsustainable sovereign debts, it is downright dangerous.",
            "基础设施融资“去风险化”的高昂成本 渥太华—世界银行和其他多边机构日益推动发展中国家采取措施实现基础设施投资的“去风险化 ” ， 这是为了增加这些项目对国际融资的吸引力。 但“去风险化”的用词不当：任何项目都可能因为外部事件、设计不佳或管理不善而受挫。 至少一定水平的风险 — — 不管是来自人为失误或制度弱点，还是来自地震、飓风和其他各种原因 — — 是所有基础设施投资所固有的。 因此，问题不在于如何消除风险，而在于如何在参与方中间分配风险。 世界银行的《PPP合同条款指南2017版 》 （ Guidance on PPP Contractual Provisions, 2017 Edition）包含了公私合作（PPP）的风险分配条款建议，其建议将这一方针用到了新的极致。 在几乎所有或有情况中 — — 从“不可抗力”到私营方业绩失败 — — 公营方都被引导假定要承担全部或大部分风险。 此外，世行确定这一一刀切方针的效果的指标是“成功采购的PPP交易 。 ” 完全没有任何指标去衡量一个项目是否向公民实际提供了意向商品或服务，如果答案是否定的，也没有任何机制追偿。 这一风险分配的极端方针可能产生重大后果。 政府在基础设施中使用PPP的一个主要原因是这样一来它们可以将这些项目列为“表外 ” 。 这意味着项目融资不会算入直接政府资本支出，也无需受到政府债务上限约束。 而由于一个项目的成本应该通过直接用户费用或政府提供的运营资金逐渐支付，其资本支出被认为是“自有资金 ” ， 政府不必担责。 但国际货币基金组织（IMF）等金融机构现在正在反驳这一“自有资金”的概念，指出政府的风险越高，项目就越不能被定义为的“表外 ” 。 据此，世界银行的有失偏颇的风险分配条款实际上应该让PPP项目更多地必须归类为表内融资和债务。 这件事本身是一件好事。 将所有基础设施项目列为表内将是政府能够更好地考察它们是否实现了资金的真正价值。 问题在于这些套路都是在幕后进行的。 与此同时，世界银行继续推销PPP为发展中国家唯一可接受的私营方可以做出贡献的基础设施投资形式。 而政府则不断地积累更多风险，它们的假设是这是表外项目，因此不计入主权债务。 结果，许多发展中国家现在走向了末日情景。 在很多例子中，政府所承担的风险会持续二三十年。 在此期间，政府将面临严重的挑战，包括管理公共支出等，还会导致与表外承诺和过度负债有关的预料之外的成本，提高所有信用承诺的违约概率。 更糟糕的是，世界银行的当前方针造成了道德风险：私营方在PPP中承担的风险越低，其因表现不佳而遭致的损失就越小。 世界银行的指南条款规定，即使是没有达到效果的公私合作项目，私营方也必须得到补偿，这样政府才能终止合同。 结果，一些私营承包商将认为自己无需拿出优异的表现；相反，它们可能会一直评估表现平庸甚至低劣的成本与收益。 当前的方针也是在公开邀请私营方通过重新谈判合同而进一步挤出政府。 因为必须吸收项目失败的全部成本，或支付更多以保证项目成功，政府将别无选择，只能向私营方的要求妥协。 这绝非牵强附会的风险。 世界银行和其他机构多年来早已明白，PPP基础设施中的私营公司频繁发起合同重新谈判。 而如果合同在不完全竞争的环境下授予 — — 从而私营公司有机会设定不现实的合同条款 — — 这样的可能性还会更大。 毫无疑问，世界银行的初衷是好的。 但将所有的风险都分配给政府绝非为发展中国家吸引投资指导。 世界银行急需改变策略。 这意味着推动平衡的风险分配，确保所有基础设施项目都作为表内项目进行评估。 无视其自身后果的指南无济于事。 而把这些指南提供给主权债务已然不可持续的发展中国家显然是极其危险的。"

            "The World Bank Must Change Course BRUSSELS – Critics have called new World Bank president David Malpass an arsonist in charge of a fire department, because of past comments he made on Bank salaries and loans to China. But it’s far more important to focus on improving progress toward the World Bank’s core mission of ending extreme poverty. In its most recent fiscal year, the Bank dished out nearly $67 billion in financing, investments, and guarantees. But under the “new course” set by its previous president, Jim Yong Kim, in 2016, the Bank aims to direct more than a quarter of its funding toward climate change. Moreover, thanks to Kim, the Bank insists that every single dollar it spends must take account of climate change, and it has ended financial support for coal-fired power plants. The argument for approaching development through the prism of climate change is that rising temperatures exacerbate challenges such as malaria and lack of access to education. Though this is true, almost all problems impact all others. An increase in malaria makes children more susceptible to hunger; poor nutrition and a lack of sanitation worsen educational performance; missing school leads to greater poverty; and so on. The more important consideration is which policy helps the most.Should we help the poor by cutting carbon dioxide emissions now and reducing temperatures a bit in 100 years’ time, or instead focus immediately on malaria and education? The evidence clearly shows that direct policies are much more effective. The World Bank’s climate focus is also at odds with what the world’s poorest citizens want. When the United Nations asked almost ten million people around the world to list their priorities, they emphasized better education and health care, less corruption, more jobs, and affordable food. Global warming came last out of 16 issues. Under Kim, the Bank propagated the simplistic idea that fossil fuels are always damaging, coal must be forbidden, and “climate aid” is the solution. The truth is far more complex. Fossil fuels do contribute to global warming – but also to prosperity and wellbeing. One billion people worldwide live in homes that lack the energy to light even a single bulb. And more than three billion live in countries without reliable, 24-hour energy networks that can power hospitals and factories. In practice, the World Bank’s policy of ditching fossil fuels and adopting a “climate lens” often means supporting off-grid solar cells that provide only enough power for a single lightbulb or to recharge a mobile phone. In some places, that can be important. But in most situations, off-grid cells are useless for tackling the main power challenges of the world’s poor. No country in history has become prosperous and globally competitive through off-grid energy. Every high-income economy relies on abundant, cheap, and mostly fossil fuel-driven energy. At the same time, three billion people currently suffer from terrible indoor air pollution, because poverty forces them to burn dirty fuels such as wood and dung to cook and keep warm. But solar panels cannot power clean stoves or heaters, or refrigerators that would stop vaccines and food from spoiling. Nor can they power the agricultural and industrial machinery that supports jobs and pathways out of poverty. In that respect, distributing solar panels is mostly a way for rich people to feel good about taking action on global warming. Rich and poor countries alike use coal because it is often still the cheapest, most dependable source of energy. The International Energy Agency estimates that even by 2040, new solar and wind power will still be more expensive in all major markets than existing coal, after the intermittent production of green energy is taken into account. Similarly, a Copenhagen Consensus study looked at the effects of building coal-fired power plants in Bangladesh. The study estimated that these plants would cause global climate damage worth $0.6 billion over the next 15 years. That’s not trivial. But by increasing the energy available for industrial development, the project would generate total benefits of $258 billion – about 500 times greater than the damages. As a result, the average Bangladeshi would be 16% richer by 2030. The project could afford to offset emissions and still be hugely effective. These are the calculations the World Bank should make. By denying a loan that would finance such coal-fired power plants, the Bank would avoid 23 cents of costs while foregoing $100 of development benefits. That’s neither moral nor sensible. There is a direct connection between power supplies and prosperity. The World Bank itself recently published a study suggesting that living in a community with power shortages reduces a person’s chances of employment by 35%-41%. And unsurprisingly, another study showed that distributing solar panels has no measurable impact beyond providing some electricity, and does not increase savings, spending, employment, income, or educational access for children. The world will reduce its reliance on fossil fuels only when genuine alternatives are cheaper and better. This will require innovative research and development to bring the price of green energy below that of fossil fuels. The World Bank could even play a role in supporting this. But Malpass must first refocus the Bank on its core mission. Despite its poorly considered climate focus, the Bank does a lot of important work. Malpass should ensure that it concentrates on its most effective initiatives – including freer trade, combating tuberculosis, early childhood nutrition, family planning, and computer-aided education. The new World Bank president has a chance to make his mark on a still-valuable organization. He should start by making a renewed commitment to eradicating poverty – including the energy poverty that wrecks so many lives.",
            "世界银行必须改弦易辙 布鲁塞尔 — — 批评人士称世界银行新任行长戴维·马尔帕斯(David Malpass) 是消防部门的纵火犯，因为他过去曾就银行发放工资和向中国贷款发表过评论。 但是，对于我们来说更重要的是，关注世界银行核心使命的推进情况，消除极端贫困。 在最近一个财年，世界银行发放了近670亿美元用于融资，投资和担保。 但根据其前任行长金墉（Jim Yong Kim）在2016年制定的“新方针 ” ， 世界银行的目标是将超过四分之一的资金用于气候变化。 此外，由于金墉的方针，世界银行坚持认为它每一美元的支出都必须考虑到气候变化，并且终止了对燃煤电厂的财政支持。 从气候变化的角度来看待发展的理由是，气温上升加剧了诸如疟疾和缺乏教育机会等挑战。 这是事实，几乎所有问题都会影响到其他方面。 疟疾的增加使儿童更容易饥饿；营养不良和缺乏卫生设施会使学业表现恶化；失学导致更大的贫困，等等。 在关于发展的辩论中，更重要的考虑因素是哪种政策最有帮助。 我们应该如何帮助穷人？ 是通过现在就减少二氧化碳的排放，从而使得气温在100年后稍微降低，还是立即把重点放在疟疾和教育上？ 证据清楚地表明，直接政策有效得多。 世界银行对气候变化的关注也与世界上最贫困的公民的实际需求相左。 当联合国要求世界各地近千万人列举出他们的当务之急时，他们强调的是更好的教育和医疗保健，减少腐败，增加就业机会和负担得起的食品。 全球变暖在16个事项排在最后。 在金墉的领导下，世界银行宣扬了一种简化的理念，即化石燃料总是有害的，必须禁止使用煤炭，而“气候援助”是解决方案。 但是事实要复杂得多。 化石燃料确实导致全球变暖 - 但也带来繁荣和福祉。 全世界有10亿人居住在能源供应不足，甚至连灯泡都不足以点亮的家庭里。 超过30亿人生活在无法支持医院和工厂24小时供电的国家。 实际上，世界银行放弃化石燃料和采用“气候变化视角”的政策往往意味着支持离网太阳能电池（的发展和应用 ） ， 而这些太阳能电池只足以单个灯泡提供电力或为手机充电。 在某些地方，这可能很重要。 但在大多数情况下，离网电池对于解决世界上穷人们面临的主要电力挑战毫无用处。 历史上没有哪个国家通过离网能源而变得繁荣和具有全球竞争力。 每个高收入经济体都依赖于丰富、廉价、主要由化石燃料驱动的能源。 与此同时，目前有30亿人遭受着可怕的室内空气污染，因为贫困迫使他们通过燃烧木头和粪便等肮脏的燃料来做饭和保暖。 然而 ， （ 世界银行提倡的）太阳能电池板无法为可以防止细菌和食物变质的清洁炉灶、加热器或冰箱供电。 它们也不能为可以支持就业和摆脱贫困的农业和工业机械提供动力。 就此而言，分发太阳能电池板主要是让富人对采取行动应对全球变暖感到欣慰。 富国和穷国都使用煤炭，因为它仍然是最廉价，最可靠的能源。 国际能源署估计，考虑到绿色能源的间歇性生产特性，即使到2040年，太阳能和风能在所有主要市场的价格仍将高于现有的煤炭。 同样，哥本哈根共识的一项研究考察了孟加拉国建设燃煤电厂的影响。 研究估计，这些设施将在未来15年内造成价值6亿美元的全球气候破坏。 这不是微不足道的。 但是，通过增加可用于工业发展的能源，该项目将产生2580亿美元的总收益 — — 这大约是所造成损失的500倍。 因此，到2030年，孟加拉人的平均财富将增加16 ％ 。 该项目对孟加拉国产生的经济效益能抵消排放损失，且仍将非常有效。 这些是世界银行应该做的考量。 通过拒绝为此类燃煤电厂提供贷款，世界银行将减少23美分的成本，但同时也放弃了价值100美元的开发收益。 这既不道德也不明智。 电力供应与繁荣之间存在直接的联系。 世界银行最近公布的一项研究表明，生活在电力供应短缺的社区会使人均就业机率减少35％到41 ％ 。 不出所料，另一项研究表明，分发太阳能电池板除了提供一些电力之外，没有任何可衡量的影响，也不会增加储蓄，支出，就业，收入或儿童的受教育机会。 只有当真正更便宜和更好的替代能源出现时，世界才会减少对化石燃料的依赖。 这将需要创新研究和开发，使绿色能源的价格低于化石燃料。 世界银行甚至可以这些方面发挥支持作用。 但马尔帕斯必须将世界银行的重点重新放在其核心使命上。 尽管世界银行对气候问题的考虑有些欠妥，但在其他方面它仍做了很多重要工作。 马尔帕斯应确保其专注于其最有效的举措 — — 包括更自由的贸易，防治结核病，关注儿童早期营养，计划生育和计算机辅助教育。 新的世界银行行长有机会在一个仍有价值的组织中留下自己的印记。 他首先应该重新致力于消除贫困 — — 包括解决使众多民众遭受苦难的能源匮乏问题。"

            "Can the World Bank Redeem Itself? CAMBRIDGE – In recent years, as the World Bank’s financing role has been eclipsed by the rise of private capital and a surge in money from China, its leaders have been desperately seeking a new mission. And interminable reorganizations, politicized appointments, and the changing priorities of successive presidents have contributed to the perception that the institution is less than functional. But can that change? The World Bank has tried to reinvent itself as a supplier of global public goods and a “knowledge bank” that provides data, analysis, and research to its developing-country clients. And few would deny the Bank’s achievements when it comes to gathering indicators of economic activity, measuring poverty, identifying deficiencies in the provision of health and education, and, in earlier years, designing and evaluating development projects. But many, such as the Nobel laureate economist Angus Deaton, have criticized the World Bank’s overall performance. One problem is that development outcomes also depend on poor countries’ external economic environment, which is shaped by the policies of the major economies. And when it comes to promoting sound policies, the World Bank has fallen far short in recent decades, exemplified by three major intellectual sins of omission. The first relates to the World Bank’s role in the Latin American debt crisis of the early 1980s. As its official history shows, the Bank restricted research on the implications of excessive borrowing during the crisis. Moreover, it did little to make the case for debt write-downs, despite the reckless increase in lending by big banks. Instead, through its structural-adjustment lending, the World Bank, along with the International Monetary Fund, effectively became a debt collector for creditors. The result was a lost decade for Latin America, but not for the bankers. The resulting moral hazard would encourage another bout of exuberant lending, which led to further financial crises in developing countries in the subsequent decade. The World Bank was also silent when its developing-country clients’ access to life-saving medications was being restricted. In the late 1980s, the leading industrialized countries – the United States, Europe, and Japan – began to push for stronger patent regimes that would boost their own pharmaceutical companies’ profits. In 1995, developing countries were forced to sign the onerous Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights agreement at the World Trade Organization. Moreover, under Section 301 of the US Trade Act of 1974, sanctions were imposed on several developing countries, from Chile to India, accused of failing to strengthen patent protections sufficiently. Even when the AIDS crisis was ravaging Sub-Saharan Africa in the early 2000s, global patent rules were not just maintained, but actually tightened further, until pressure from civil society finally forced the expansion of access to affordable treatment. The World Bank, however, said little. This brings us to the World Bank’s third failure, the consequences of which are unfolding today. During much of the 1980s and 1990s, the Bank oversaw structural adjustment programs in developing countries that focused on deregulation, privatization, and economic liberalization, especially trade opening, all of which helped to enable globalization. While there were undoubtedly problems with many aspects of such a one-size-fit-all package of policies – the Washington Consensus, as it was known – the trade liberalization component helped accelerate lower-middle-income and middle-income countries’ economic convergence with developed countries. But, today, the United States is rejecting trade openness, imposing unilateral tariffs and other barriers, and renegotiating trade deals on worse terms. And the World Bank’s silence is deafening. Its senior leadership has said nothing about the serious threat posed by the actions of the US or of other major players. While the Bank’s annual report, released in September, talks of a commitment to “researching today’s most pressing topics,” trade is not among them. This is not just some oversight; during all of these episodes, the Bank knew that its responsibility was to act as an advocate for its poor clients. Instead, it decided – every time – to kowtow to its most powerful shareholders and their vested interests (such as Big Pharma and the financial industry), arguably in exchange for additional resources for its soft-loan window (the International Development Association) and, less frequently, capital increases for the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and International Finance Corporation. For example, this April – after the US had launched its trade war with tariffs on steel and aluminum – the Development Committee of the World Bank Board of Governors endorsed a package that included a $7.5 billion paid-in capital increase for the IBRD. This required the support of President Donald Trump’s administration, leading to silence from the Bank until June, when it finally warned of the negative impact of trade protectionism on global growth. One might wonder whether such a Faustian bargain could be worthwhile if it means that the World Bank has more resources to promote development in poor countries. But while money certainly matters, the evidence suggests that development outcomes are determined more by factors like state capacity and national policies, and crucially, a supportive global environment. Rising trade protectionism, tighter immigration policies, and a lack of action on climate change by the world’s biggest economic players – particularly the US – thus pose serious threats to development, which a little extra money for the World Bank cannot offset. The ends do not justify the means: money may not matter that much, while ideas matter immensely in the broader fight against poverty (as this year’s Nobel Economics laureate, Paul Romer, has shown). The World Bank cannot erase its troubling history of silence. But it may be able to redeem itself. Its new chief economist is an expert on trade. The Bank’s leadership should empower her to lead the charge in making the intellectual case for open markets for goods, services, and people. The World Bank is well aware that its mission – “to reduce poverty, and improve living standards by promoting sustainable growth and investment in people” – cannot be achieved without an open global system. If it chooses not to uphold a core tenet of its mission, and instead continues to try ingratiating itself with its largest shareholders, it will not only fail its clients throughout the developing world; it will also lose whatever is left of its raison d’être.",
            "世界银行能实现自我救赎吗？ 发自剑桥 — — 随着这几年私人资本崛起以及来自中国的资金激增，世界银行的融资角色已经黯然失色，其领导人一直在想方设法寻求新的使命。 然而无休止的重组，政治化的人事任命以及历任总裁不断更改的优先事项都使人们认为该机构已经不具备实用性。 那么这一切能有所改变吗？ 世界银行一直试图将自身重塑为一个全球公共产品供应商以及为其发展中国家客户提供数据，分析和研究的“知识库 ” 。 同时该机构在收集经济活动指标，衡量贫困程度，揭示健康和教育供应短缺状况，以及在早些年设计和评估发展项目方面所取得的成就也是举世公认的。 但也有许多人，比如诺贝尔经济学奖获得者安格斯·迪顿（Angus Deaton ） ， 对世界银行的整体表现提出了批评。 一个问题在于发展成果还取决于贫穷国家的外部经济环境，而后者又是由主要经济体的政策所决定的。 同时在近几十年间世界银行在推动合理健全的政策方面已经远远落后，特别是出现了三起在智识上的重大疏忽事件。 第一件涉及到世界银行在1980年代初期拉美债务危机中所扮演的角色。 正如其官方历史记录所示，世行限制了针对危机期间过度借贷影响的研究。 此外尽管各个大型银行都在不顾一切地增加贷款，但它在要求债务减记方面却鲜有作为。 相反，通过其结构调整型贷款，世界银行和国际货币基金组织实际上成为了债权人的债务催收员。 结果是拉丁美洲失去了十年，而银行家们却全身而退。 由此产生的道德风险又激励了另一轮大干快上的贷款，进一步推动了发展中国家在随后十年中多次爆发金融危机。 当其发展中国家客户在救命药物方面受到限制时，世界银行也保持了沉默。 在1980年代末各主要工业化国家 — — 美国，欧洲和日本 — — 开始推动更强势的专利制度以提高本国制药公司的利润。 1995年，发展中国家被迫在世界贸易组织框架内签署了繁重苛刻的《与贸易有关的知识产权协定 》 。 此外还根据1974年《美国贸易法案》第301条对从智利到印度的多个被指控未能充分加强专利保护的发展中国家实施制裁。 即便是艾滋病危机在21世纪初肆虐撒哈拉以南非洲地区之时，全球专利规则也不仅得到了维持，甚至实际上进一步收紧，直到民间社会的压力最终迫使获取可负担治疗的渠道得以扩大才告一段落。 然而世界银行对此却惜字如金。 这就把我们引向了世界银行的第三项失误 — — 而其后果眼下正在徐徐展现。 在1980年代和1990年代的大部分时间里，世界银行监督发展中国家实施的结构调整方案重点都在于放松管制，私有化和经济自由化，尤其是贸易开放，所有这一切都有助于全球化的实现。 虽然这种一刀切式的一揽子政策 — — 就是众所周知的华盛顿共识 — — 无疑在许多方面都存在着问题，但其与贸易自由化相关的要件有助于加速缩小中低收入国家和中等收入国家与发达国家之间的经济差距。 但如今美国开始抵制贸易开放并强行施加单边关税及其他障碍，并祭出更糟糕的条件来重新谈判贸易协议。 而世界银行对此简直陷入了死一般的沉默。 其高级领导层对美国或其他主要参与者的行径所构成的严重威胁三缄其口。 虽然该行于9月发布的年度报告谈到了“研究当前最紧迫话题”的承诺，但贸易竟不在其中。 这可不仅仅是疏忽；在所有这些事件中，世行知道自己责任是要为那些贫穷国家客户争取权益，但它却决定 — — 而且是无一例外地 — — 向那些最有权势的股东及其既得利益者（如大型制药公司和金融业）俯首称臣，据说是为其软贷款窗口（国际发展协会）换取额外资源以及（不那么频繁地）为国际复兴开发银行和国际金融公司增加资本。 例如，今年4月 — — 在美国利用钢铁和铝关税发起贸易战后 — — 世界银行理事会发展委员会批准了一揽子计划，其中包括为国际复兴开发银行增加75亿美元的实收资本。 为了换取特朗普总统政府的支持世界银行一直对贸易战保持沉默，直到6月才终于对贸易保护主义对全球增长的负面影响发出警告。 人们可能会思考如果这意味着世界银行能有更多资源来促进贫穷国家的发展，那么这种类似浮士德与魔鬼交易的做法是否也值得一试。 资金固然重要，但有证据表明，发展的成果其实更多地取决于国家能力和国家政策等因素，更重要的是要有一个起到支持作用的全球环境。 全球最大的经济参与者 — — 特别是美国 — — 不断上升的贸易保护主义，更严格的移民政策以及对气候变化的无动于衷已经对发展构成了严重威胁，这是世界银行所获得的额外资金所无法抵消的。 其实结果无法证明手段的正当性：资金可能并不是那么重要，而理念则会在更广泛的反贫困斗争中起到极为关键的作用 — — 正如今年的诺贝尔经济学奖获得者保罗·罗默（Paul Romer）所表明的那样。 世界银行无法抹去其令人不安的沉默历史。 但它或许能够实现自我救赎。 其新任首席经济学家是贸易专家，而世界银行的领导层应该授权她去为商品，服务和人员的开放市场做出明智的指引。 世界银行清楚地意识到，如果没有开放的全球体系，它的使命 — — “通过促进可持续增长以及对人的投资来减少贫困，提高生活水平 ” — —是不可能实现的。 如果它选择不去坚持其使命的核心原则，而是继续尝试讨好其最大的股东，那么它不仅会辜负那些发展中国家客户；也将失去其存在的理由。"

            "The Sky Is Not Falling VIENNA – Humans are partial to bad news. Media outlets reflect and shape this preference, feeding us woe and panic. Long, slow, positive trends don’t make it to the front page or to water-cooler conversations. So we develop peculiar misperceptions, especially the idea that a preponderance of things are going wrong. When I published The Skeptical Environmentalist in 2001, I pointed out that the world was getting better in many respects. Back then, this was viewed as heresy, as it punctured several common and cherished misperceptions, such as the idea that natural resources were running out, that an ever-growing population was leaving less to eat, and that air and water were becoming ever-more polluted. In each case, careful examination of the data established that the gloomy scenarios prevailing at the time were exaggerated. While fish stocks, for example, are depleted because of a lack of regulation, we can actually eat more fish than ever, thanks to the advent of aquaculture. Worries that we are losing forests overlook the reality that as countries become richer, they increase their forest cover. Since I wrote the book, the world has only become better, according to many important indicators. We have continued to see meaningful reductions in infant mortality and malnutrition, and there have been massive strides toward eradication of polio, measles, malaria, and illiteracy. By focusing on the most lethal environmental problem – air pollution – we can see some of the reasons for improvement. As the world developed, deaths from air pollution have declined dramatically, and that trend is likely to continue. Looking at a polluted city in a country like China might suggest otherwise, but the air inside the homes of most poor people is about ten times more polluted than the worst outdoor air in Beijing. The most serious environmental problem for humans is indoor air pollution from cooking and heating with dirty fuels like wood and dung – which is the result of poverty. In 1900, more than 90% of all air pollution deaths resulted from indoor air pollution. Economic development has meant more outdoor pollution, but also much less indoor pollution. Reductions in poverty have gone hand in hand with a four-fold reduction in global air pollution mortality. Yet more people today still die from indoor air pollution than from outdoor pollution. Even in China, while outside air has become a lot more polluted, poverty reduction has caused a lower risk of total air pollution death. And as countries become richer, they can afford to regulate and cut even outdoor air pollution. Two hundred years ago, almost every person on the planet lived in poverty, and a tiny elite in luxury. Today just 9.1% of the population, or almost 700 million people, lives on less than $1.90 per day (or what used to be one dollar in 1985). And just in the last 20 years, the proportion of people living in extreme poverty has almost halved. Yet few of us know this. The Gapminder foundation surveyed the UK and found that just 10% of people believe poverty has decreased. In South Africa and in Sweden, more people believe extreme poverty has doubled than believe – correctly – that it has plummeted. How do we continue our swift progress? There has been no shortage of well-intentioned policy interventions, so we have decades of data showing what works well and what doesn’t. In the latter category, even well-considered ideas from the world’s most eminent thinkers can fall short. The ambitious Millennium Villages concept was supposed to create simultaneous progress on multiple fronts, producing “major results in three or fewer years,” according to founder Jeffrey D. Sachs. But a study by the United Kingdom’s Department for International Development shows the villages had “moderately positive impacts,” and “little overall impact on poverty.” It’s more constructive to focus on what works. Global analysis of development targets for Copenhagen Consensus by a panel of Nobel laureate economists showed where more money can achieve the most. They concluded that improved access to contraception and family-planning services would reduce maternal and child mortality, and also – through a demographic dividend – increase economic growth. Likewise, research assessing the best development policies for Haiti found that focusing on improvements in nutrition through the use of fortified flour would transform the health of young children, creating lifelong benefits. Other Copenhagen Consensus research suggests that scaling up government e-procurement platforms would be transformative. This may sound tangential to poverty reduction, but it’s not. On average, developing countries use half their budgets on procurement; enabling transparent competition could reduce losses caused by corruption. This is not mere speculation. A case study in Bangladesh, which spends more than $9 billion on public procurement annually, found that piloting e-procurement in just one government department lowered prices by 12%, leaving more resources for other important budget priorities. The research shows that expanding digital procurement government-wide would save $670 million annually – enough to increase annual public-health spending by about 50%. The Bangladeshi government is now fast-tracking this expansion. And the most powerful weapon in the fight against poverty is the one that got us where we are today: broad-based economic growth. Over the past 30 years, China’s growth spurt alone lifted an unprecedented 680 million people above the poverty line. A global trade agreement – such as a successful conclusion to the stalled Doha Round – would lift another 160 million people out of poverty. Skepticism toward free trade hurts the world’s poorest. While other US policies and tweets by President Donald Trump get far more coverage, the current administration’s rejection of free trade could be the biggest tragedy. Humanity’s success in reducing poverty is an extraordinary achievement, and one that we are far too reticent about acknowledging. We need to make sure that we don’t lose sight of what got us this far – and what justifies the hope of an even better future.",
            "天并没有塌下来 维也纳 — — 人类更愿意相信坏消息。 媒体渠道反映并迎合这种偏好，为我们带来悲伤和恐惧。 缓慢而积极的长期趋势不会出现在头版头条，也不会成为人们茶余饭后的谈资。 因此我们发展出特殊的误解，尤其认为绝大多数领域都在出现问题。 2001年我出版充满怀疑的环保主义者时，就曾指出世界在许多方面都取得了进步。 我的观点在当时就被视为异端邪说，因为它戳穿了几项被人们普遍接受的错误认知，如认为自然资源正在枯竭、不断增长的人口正在导致粮食短缺，而空气和水污染所造成严重问题正变得越来越严重。 在所有情况下，认真审视数据都会发现夸大了当时流行一时的悲观情绪。 例如，尽管缺乏监管正导致鱼类资源陷入枯竭，但多亏水产养殖业的发展，实际我们却可以吃到比以往更多的鱼。 担心森林正在消失的忧虑忽视了这样一个现实，那就是越来越富裕的国家增加了森林覆盖率。 写完这本书后，据许多重要指标显示，世界已经取得了持续的进步。 我们继续目睹婴儿死亡率和营养不良率大幅降低，而且巨大的进展发生在消灭小儿麻痹、麻疹、疟疾和文盲等领域。 通过重点研究最致命的环境问题 — — 空气污染 — — 我们可以找到一些进步的原因和理由。 随着世界的发展，空气污染造成的死亡急剧下降，而这种趋势很有可能会延续下去。 单看中国等国家的受污染城市可能得出不同的结论，但多数贫困民众的室内污染比北京最严重的室外空气污染要差十倍。 对人类而言，最严重的环境问题是利用木材和牛粪等肮脏燃料烹饪和取暖所造成的室内空气污染 — — 而这种污染来源于贫困。 1900年，空气污染死亡率的90%以上来自室内空气污染。 经济发展恶化了室外空气污染，但同时也导致室内污染大幅降低。 经济发展在减贫的同时导致全球空气污染死亡率降低了4倍。 而今天室内空气污染仍然比室外污染致死的人更多。 即使中国的室外空气污染进一步加重，但减贫仍然导致空气污染死亡的总体风险降低。 而随着国家变得越来越富，甚至就连室外空气污染他们都有能力监管和控制。 200年前，地球上几乎所有人口都陷于贫困，只有一小撮精英才能享受奢侈。 而今天，仅总人口的9.1 % ， 也就是差不多7亿，每天仅靠不足1.9美元生活（1985年这一数字曾仅有一美元左右 ） 。 而在过去20年中生活在极端贫困中的人口比例几乎减少近半。 但鲜有人知道这样的事实。 Gapminder基金会对英国进行了调查，发现认为贫困减少的人仅占10 % 。 在南非和瑞典，更多人相信极端贫困翻了一番，而并不相信极端贫困已经大幅减少的事实。 我们怎样才能快速发展下去？ 人类从不缺少善意的政策干预，因此我们有几十年的资料显示哪些措施行之有效，哪些则不是。 在后一种类别中，即使世界最杰出思想家深思熟虑的想法也有可能出错。 按照创始人杰弗里·萨克斯的说法，雄心勃勃的千禧村概念本应在多方面同时取得进展 ， “ 用三年或者更少的时间创造出重大的成果 ” 。 但英国国际发展部的一项研究表明千禧村仅产生了“微弱的积极效应 ” ， 而对“消除贫困的整体影响不大 ” 。 更具建设性的方法是关注有效的举措。 由诺贝尔经济学奖获得者组成的专家小组对哥本哈根共识发展目标的全球分析表明在哪些领域投资可以取得最大的成果。 他们的结论是加强避孕和计划生育服务能降低孕产妇和儿童的死亡率，并同时 — — 通过人口红利 — — 推动经济增长。 同样，评估海地最佳发展政策的研究发现通过使用强化面粉重点改善营养能够彻底改变幼儿的健康状况，并终身为其带来好处。 其他哥本哈根共识研究表明扩大政府采购平台将带来革命性效果。 这听上去似乎与减贫无关，但实际情况却不是这样。 平均而言，发展中国家将预算的一半用于采购，创造透明的竞争环境可以减少腐败造成的损失。 这绝不仅仅是无端的猜测。 针对孟加拉国每年在公共采购上花费超过90亿美元的一项案例研究显示，仅在一个政府部门试行电子采购就降低了12%的价格，从而可以将节省下来的更多资源用于其他重要的预算事项。 研究表明在整个政府范围内实现数字采购每年可以节约6.7亿美元 — — 足以增加50%的年度公共卫生支出。 孟加拉国政府现在正在抓紧推广电子采购工作。 与贫困作斗争最有力的武器让我们取得了今天经济普遍增长的伟大成就。 过去30年，仅中国的经济发展井喷就实现了前所未有的6.8亿人脱贫致富。 达成全球贸易协议 — — 如圆满结束停滞不前的多哈回合谈判 — — 将使另外1.6亿人脱贫致富。 怀疑自由贸易会损害世界最贫困的民众。 尽管唐纳德·特朗普总统其他的美国政策和推文吸引了更多的媒体关注，但现政府拒绝自由贸易可能拉开了最大悲剧的序幕。 人类减贫成功是一项了不起的成就，我们对这方面的认识还远远不足。 我们必须确保了解上述成就的来源 — — 以及什么才能使我们的未来更加充满希望。"

            "The Case for a World Carbon Bank CAMBRIDGE – Although much derided by climate-change deniers, not least US President Donald Trump, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s Green New Deal hits the nail on the head with its urgent call for the United States to lead by example on global warming. But the sad truth is that, for all the needless waste produced by American’s gluttonous culture, emerging Asia is by far the main driver of the world’s growing carbon dioxide emissions. No amount of handwringing will solve the problem. The way to do that is to establish the right incentives for countries such as China, India, Vietnam, Indonesia, and Bangladesh. It is hard to see how to do this within the framework of existing multilateral aid institutions, which have limited expertise on climate issues and are pulled in different directions by their various constituencies. For example, to the dismay of many energy experts, the World Bank recently rather capriciously decided to stop funding virtually all new fossil-fuel plants, including natural gas. But replacing dirty coal plants with relatively clean natural gas is how the US has managed to reduce emissions growth dramatically over the past decade (despite Trump’s best efforts), and is a centerpiece of the famous “Princeton wedges” pragmatic options for minimizing climate risk. One cannot let the perfect become the enemy of good in the transition to a carbon-neutral future. It is high time to create a new, focused agency, a World Carbon Bank, that provides a vehicle for advanced economies to coordinate aid and technical transfer, and that is not simultaneously trying to solve every other development problem. Yes, I fully understand that the current US administration is reluctant to fund even existing international institutions. But the West cannot retreat from a world of intertwined climate responsibilities. According to the International Energy Agency – one of the few honest brokers in the global climate-change debate and a model on which a new World Carbon Bank research department could build – annual CO2 emissions in Asia are now double that of the America’s, and triple that of Europe. In advanced economies, where the average age of coal plants is 42 years, many are reaching the natural end of their lifespan, and it is not a great burden to phase them out. But in Asia, where one new coal plant a week is being built, the average age is only 11 years, and most will be running for decades to come. Coal accounts for over 60% of electricity generation in rapidly growing China and India. Even though both countries are investing heavily in renewables such as solar and wind power, their energy needs are simply growing too fast to cast aside widely available coal. How can the US arrogantly tell India to cut back on CO2 emissions that are only one-tenth those of the US? For that matter, how can the US persuade Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro’s government to cut back on Amazon deforestation (rainforests are nature’s carbon sink) and development without providing some concrete incentives? There are many options for trying to reduce carbon emissions. Most economists (including me) favors a global carbon tax, though some argue that the more politically digestible cap-and-trade formula can be virtually as effective. But this is pie in the sky for developing-country governments desperate to meet their people’s basic energy needs. In Africa, only 43% of people have access to electricity, versus 87% worldwide. Ignorant presidents aside, most serious researchers see the risk of catastrophic climate change as perhaps the greatest existential threat facing the world in the twenty-first century. The effects are already with us, whether record heat on the US West Coast and in Europe, epic flooding in Iowa, or the impact of climate risks on the price of home insurance, which is rising beyond the reach of many people. And today’s refugee problem is nothing compared to what the world faces as equatorial regions become too hot and too arid to sustain agriculture, and as the number of climate migrants explodes to perhaps a billion or more by the end of the century. The US military is readying itself for the threat. Back in 2013, the chief of the US Pacific forces, admiral Samuel J. Locklear, listed long-term climate change as the biggest national-security threat. Given grave doubts about whether existing measures, such as the 2015 Paris climate agreement, are likely to do more than slightly slow down global warming, pragmatists are right to see preparing for the worst as a grim necessity. Advanced economies need to put their own environmental house in order. But it will not be nearly enough if developing Asia, and perhaps someday developing Africa, are not also placed on a different development track. A new World Carbon Bank is almost surely a necessary piece of any comprehensive solution, even given the miraculous technological developments everyone is hoping for. How much it will cost depends on assumptions and ambitions, but one can easily imagine a trillion dollars over ten years. Crazy? Maybe not, compared to the alternatives. Even a Green New Deal is better than a Green No Deal.",
            "建立世界碳银行的必要性 坎布里奇—尽管受到了美国总统特朗普气候变化拒绝派的冷嘲热讽，但亚历山德里亚·奥卡西奥-克尔特兹（Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez）的绿色新政仍然直击要害，要求美国在全球变暖问题上以身作则。 但悲哀的事实是，尽管美国的饕餮文化产生了诸多毫无必要的浪费，但到目前为止，新兴亚洲才是世界二氧化碳排放增加的主要推动力。 再歇斯底里也不能解决问题。 行动方案是要给中国、印度、越南、印度尼西亚和孟加拉国等国家建立正确的激励。 现有多变援助机构框架下，很难找到可行之道。 当前框架再气候问题上的专业性不够，并且根据不同的区域各有各的方向。 比如，最近世界银行颇为任性地决定停止位几乎所有新化石燃料（包括天然气）电厂提供融资，令许多能源专家非常失望。 但用相对清洁的天然气代替肮脏的煤电正是过去十年美国成功大幅降低排放增长的诀窍（特朗普尽了力 ） ， 也是著名的其后风险最小化的务实方案“普林斯顿楔子 ” （ Princeton wedges）的核心。 绝不能让最完美的方案沦为通往碳中性未来的转型中的公敌。 必须立即成立一个新的专门机构世界碳银行（World Carbon Bank ） ， 为发达经济提供协调援助和技术转移的工具，以协调援助和技术转移，而不再负责解决其他所有发展问题。 是的，我充分理解美国现任政府连为现有国际机构拨款的意愿也已经荡然无存。 但西方无法撤出一个气候责任互相交织的世界。 据国际原子能机构数据，亚洲每年二氧化碳排放量现在已是美国的两倍，是欧洲的三倍。 国际原子能机构是极少数真心实意斡旋全球气候变化争论的机构之一，可以以它为基础构建新的世界碳银行研究部。 再发达经济体，煤电厂的平均年龄为42年，许多已经达到了自然使用年限，逐步弃用并非沉重的负担。 但在亚洲，每年都有一家新煤电厂开建，煤电厂的平均年龄仅为11年，大部分还将运行数十年之久。 在增长迅速的中国和印度，煤炭贡献了60%的发电量。 虽然两国都在大量投资可再生能源（如太阳能和风能 ） ， 但它们的能源需求增加太快，不可能摒弃可方便获取的煤炭。 美国如何傲慢地要求印度削减二氧化碳排放？ 印度的排放量不过美国的十分之一。 同理，如果不提供切实的激励，美国如何说服巴西总统博尔索纳罗政府减少亚马逊森林采伐（热带雨林是大自然的碳汇）和开发？ 减少碳排放有许多选项。 大部分经济学家（包括我）偏向于全球碳税，但也有一些人认为，政治上更加易行的限额和交易模式也能起到几乎相同的效果。 但对于急于满足人民基本能源需要的发展中国家政府来说，这些属于空中楼阁。 在非洲，只有43%的人能用上电，全世界的这一比例为87 % 。 除了傲慢的总统，大部分严肃的研究者将灾难性气候变化的风险视为也许是二十一世纪世界所面临的最大的生存威胁。 其影响已经显现，如美国西海岸和欧洲创纪录的热浪；艾奥瓦州巨型洪灾；气候风险导致房屋保险价格攀升到许多人无法承受的水平等。 热带地区太热太旱而无法维持农业，气候移民人数有望在本世纪末剧增至十亿或以上，相比之下，当今的难民问题根本算不上什么。 美国军队已经在为这一威胁做好准备。 2013年，美国太平洋部队司令塞缪尔·洛克利尔上将（Samuel J. Locklear）便将长期气候变化列为最大的国家安全威胁。 人们对于现有措施 — — 如2015年 巴黎气候协定 — — 阻止全球变暖的力量颇有怀疑，因此务实派将最糟糕的情况作为残酷的必然结果来准备是正确的。 发达经济体必须收拾好自己的环境。 但如果发展中的亚洲—也许有朝一日海报口发展中的非洲—不同样走上不同的发展道路，这也许是不够的。 新的世界碳银行几乎肯定是一切全面方案的必备条件，即使我们拥有所有人都希望拥有的日新月异的科技发展。 成本如何取决于假设和雄心，但未来十年超过一万亿美元不难想象。 疯狂吗？ 也许并不，如果与不这么做相比的话。 哪怕是绿色新政，也好过绿色无政。"

            "The World Cup and the World Economy LONDON – The 22nd World Cup is under way, but who at the beginning of this century would have thought it might be hosted by tiny Qatar? Yet here we are, and the only surprise is that it doesn’t feel all that surprising. For a large part of my professional career, I explored the links between the beautiful game and the global economy. At Goldman Sachs and, before that, at the Swiss Bank Corporation, I indulged my dual obsessions by presiding over special one-off publications for each World Cup from 1994 until 2010. After one, I received personal messages from senior central bankers around the world. Some told me it was the best publication we produced, which, given how frequently we published on economic events and markets, was both amusing and something to ponder. We persuaded national leaders and major football figures to guest write for us. On one occasion, Alex Ferguson, the legendary Manchester United manager, selected his all-time top world team. I have, to date, managed to attend six World Cups, hosted by the United States, France, South Korea and Japan, Germany, South Africa, and Brazil. From these experiences, I can add my voice to those who describe the event as one of the most beautifully inclusive meetings of many different nationalities and cultures. The advent of the Fan Zones, which really took off following the 2006 World Cup in Germany, embodied this spirit, though I experienced it most intensely in Seoul in 2002. The link between football and the state of the world economy is apparent in the choice of tournament hosts. I think it is an inescapable fact that FIFA’s selection of South Africa in 2010, Brazil in 2014, Russia in 2018, and now Qatar, was based on the steady rise of so-called emerging economies during the first two decades of this century. I have long thought that the other two BRICS countries (a group comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) might well join the small group of hosts in the future. But given many major countries’ inward turn in recent years, are the days of even wanting to host the event numbered? Will aspiring emerging-market countries find it increasingly difficult to succeed in staging the world’s most watched tournament? Or, to the contrary, could the world soon shift back to a more contented, globalizing, and inclusive international order? One might even ask a deeper question: is FIFA a leading or a lagging indicator of the world economy and the degree of globalization? I suspect that how the competition progresses over the next four weeks and, crucially, how many of us watch the matches, might be the clearest early sign of the broader significance of this year’s World Cup. The competition has been the backbone of FIFA’s revenues. There is already talk – probably motivated by professional clubs’ desire for even stronger revenues – of turning the tournament into a biennial event, or supplementing the current quadrennial format with a quadrennial club-based competition. If the global economy’s future is very different from the past 20-30 years, this will be reflected in FIFA’s decision-making. It is hard to imagine FIFA being enthusiastic about future competitions in emerging-market countries if these countries contribute less to world economic growth than the tournament hosts since 2010. In the 1980’s, 1990’s, 2000’s, and 2011-20, global real GDP growth averaged, respectively, 3.3%, 3.3%, 3.9%, and 3.7%. The acceleration in the most recent two full decades was clearly due to stronger growth in the emerging world, and it coincides with the period when FIFA began selecting hosts from outside the traditional football strongholds. It currently looks as though this trend could be reversed this decade, even with eight years still to go. And what about the winners this time? I learned through the popularity of the publications I produced in the past to go no further than predicting the four semi-finalists. For one thing, the same realism with which one must approach economic forecasting applies to the World Cup as well; for another, the leaders of countries we didn’t tip to win often didn’t take it very well. I start with history. Only eight countries have won the World Cup. Brazil, having won five times, is always one of the favorites, and this year’s squad seems to be one of the tournament’s strongest. Argentina, Uruguay, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and England are the other previous winners. Even though Italy failed to qualify this time around, the winner is likely to be one of the others. One of these years, England will win it again, but it could easily be any of the previous winners. Among the rest, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Portugal usually punch above their economic and population weight. Whoever wins, I will be watching for all sorts of signals about the future – just as I have always done.",
            "世界杯和世界经济 伦敦—第22届世界杯正在进行，但在本世纪初，谁会想到可能由小国卡塔尔来主办这次世界杯？ 但现实就是这样，唯一令人意想不到的是，这并不那么令人感到意外。 纵观我职业生涯的大部分时间，我都在探索这一精彩赛事和全球经济之间的联系。 在高盛和之前的瑞士银行集团就职期间，从1994~2010年，我主持出版了每届世界杯的特别一次性出版物，沉溺于我对这两者的双重痴迷。 其中一份出版后，我收到了来自各国央行资深行长的私人信息。 有人告诉我，这是我们制作的最好的出版物，鉴于我们发表经济事件与市场评论的超高频率，这样的说法既有意思又发人深思。 我们说服国家领导人和著名足球人物充当我们的客座写手。 有一次，曼联传奇主帅亚力克斯·福格森选出了他心目中所认为的世界顶级球队。 迄今为止，我已成功参加了由美国、法国、韩国和日本、德国、南非以及巴西所主办的6届世界杯。 从我这些亲身经历，我可以向那些将这一赛事描述为诸多不同民族和文化最具包容性聚会的人表达我的心声。 尽管令我感受最深的是2002年的首尔，但2006年德国世界杯后才真正出现的球迷专区体现出了这种精神。 足球和世界经济状况之间的联系在赛事主办国的选择上显而易见。 我认为，一个无可逃避的现实是，国际足联在2010年选择南非、2014年选择巴西、2018年选择俄罗斯以及现在选择卡塔尔都是基于本世纪头20年所谓新兴经济体的稳步崛起。 我一直认为，另外两个金砖国家（一个由巴西、俄罗斯、印度、中国和南非所组成的集团）也很有可能在未来加入主办国的小团体。 但鉴于诸多主要国家近年来均向内转向，是否就连想要举办世界杯的日子都已经屈指可数？ 雄心勃勃的新兴市场国家是否会发现，越来越难以成功举办这一全世界最为瞩目的锦标赛？ 或者，恰恰相反，世界会否很快转回到一种更为满足、全球化和包容的国际秩序？ 人们甚至可能提出更深层次的疑问：国际足联究竟是世界经济和全球化程度的领先还是落后指标？ 我怀疑，接下来的四周比赛进展如何，关键是有多少人观看这次赛事，可能在早期就最明确地显示了今年世界杯更大范围意义。 这一赛事一直是国际足联的收入支柱。 已经有人在谈论 — — 或许是出于职业俱乐部对更高收入的渴望 — — 将锦标赛改为两年举办一次，或者用4年一次的俱乐部比赛来补充目前4年一次的世界杯。 如果全球经济与过去20~30年截然不同，这将在国际足联的决策中有所反应。 很难想象，国际足联会对未来由新兴市场国家举办比赛充满热忱，如果这些国家对世界经济增长的贡献比自2010年以来的锦标赛主办国要低。 20世纪80年代、90年代、21世纪和2011~2020年，全球实际GDP增长平均分别为3.3 % 、 3.3 % 、 3.9%和3.7 % 。 最近整整20年的加速增长显然是由于新兴世界的增长强势，而这恰好是国际足联开始从传统足球强国以外挑选主办国的时期。 目前来看，即使还剩下8年时间，也有可能在近十年逆转这一趋势。 那么谁会在这次赛事中获胜？ 以我过去制作流行出版物所得到的经验，最多也就是预测4支半决赛球队。 一方面，人们赖以进行经济预测的同样的现实主义也必须适用于世界杯；而另一方面，我们没有预测获胜的那些国家的领导人往往会不太高兴。 我们从历史开始。 仅有8个国家曾经赢得过世界杯。 巴西队曾5次夺冠，一直是最受青睐的球队之一，而今年的巴西队似乎在锦标赛上拥有最强的实力。 阿根廷、乌拉圭、法国、德国、意大利、西班牙和英格兰是其他曾经获胜的球队。 尽管意大利这次未能晋级，但最终的获胜者很有可能是这些其他国家之一。 这些年间，英格兰将再次夺冠，但也完全有可能是此前曾经夺冠的其他球队。 在其余国家中，丹麦、荷兰和葡萄牙往往可以超越其经济和人口的比重。 无论谁能获胜，我都会关注未来的各种信号 — — 就像我一直以来所做的那样。"

            "The World Economy in 2018 STANFORD – All major macroeconomic indicators – growth, unemployment, and inflation – suggest that 2017 will be the American economy’s best year in a decade. And the global economy is enjoying broad, synchronized growth beyond what anyone expected. The question now is whether this strong performance will continue in 2018. The answer, of course, will depend on monetary, fiscal, trade, and related policies in the United States and around the world. And yet it is hard to predict what policy proposals will emerge in 2018. There are relatively new heads of state in the US, France, and the United Kingdom; German leaders still have not formed a governing coalition since the general election in September; and the US Federal Reserve has a new chair awaiting confirmation. Moreover, major changes in important developing economies such as Argentina, Saudi Arabia, and Brazil have made the future outlook even murkier. Still, we should hope for the best. First and foremost, we should hope that synchronized global growth at a rate of just under 4% will continue in 2018, as the International Monetary Fund projected in October. Growth not only raises incomes, but also makes vexing problems such as bad bank loans and budget deficits more manageable. As former US President John F. Kennedy famously said in an October 1963 speech in which he promoted his proposed corporate and personal tax reductions, “a rising tide lifts all boats.” For my part, I predict that the global recovery will continue, but at a slightly slower growth rate of around 3.5%. The two most obvious risks to keep an eye on will be Europe, where a cyclical upturn could stall, and the oil-rich Middle East, where tensions could flare up once again. Second, let us hope that the Fed, guided by the steady hand of its new chair, Jerome “Jay” Powell, will continue or even accelerate its monetary-policy normalization, both by raising its benchmark federal funds rate, and by shrinking its engorged balance sheet. And we should hope that economic conditions allow the other major central banks, especially the European Central Bank, to follow suit. On this front, I predict that the major central banks will continue to normalize monetary policies more gradually than is necessary. The biggest risk here is that markets may try to test the Fed under its new leadership, for example, if inflation rises faster than anticipated. Third, let us hope that the Republican tax package will, if enacted, deliver on its promise of increased investment, output, productivity, and wages over the coming decade. Here, I predict that the legislation will pass, and that investment in the US over the next few years will be relatively higher than if no action had been taken. To be sure, whether investment will rise from its currently subdued level will depend on many other factors than the corporate-tax rate. But the tax package can still be expected to boost output, productivity, and wages. The question is not if, but when. If the full effects of the legislation are not felt before the 2018 or 2020 elections, that lag could prove politically consequential. The biggest danger is that its benefits will be delayed, and that its key provisions will be reversed whenever the Democrats are back in power. Fourth, let us hope that governments everywhere begin to address the looming crisis in public-pension and health-care costs, which have been rising for decades. As social programs become costlier, they crowd out government expenditures on necessities such as defense, while generating ever more pressure to impose higher growth-suppressing taxes. Europe, in particular, must not let its cyclical rebound lull it into complacency. Many European Union member states still need to reduce their government debt, and the eurozone needs to resolve its “zombie bank” crisis. Beyond that, structural labor-market reforms of the kind French President Emmanuel Macron is pursuing would be most welcome. Unfortunately, I’m afraid that progress on structural reforms will be sporadic, at best. The danger is that slow growth will not lead to sufficient wage gains and job creation to defuse the ticking time bomb of high youth unemployment in many countries. Another risk is that reform attempts could provoke a political backlash that would be harmful to long-term investment. Fifth, let us hope that the eurozone can avoid a currency crisis. This will depend largely on whether German Chancellor Angela Merkel can form a coalition government and restore political stability to Europe’s largest economy. Sixth, we should hope that the EU and the UK can agree on a reasonable Brexit deal that will preserve fairly strong trade relations. The main risk here is that localized declines in trade could spill over and cause broader harm. And, beyond Europe, let us hope that negotiations between the US, Canada, and Mexico over the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) will result in an arrangement that still facilitates continental trade. For trade generally, the biggest risk is that the Trump administration could start a lose-lose trade dispute, owing to its understandable eagerness to help American manufacturing workers. Seventh, let us hope that new policies targeting information and communication technology (ICT) strike the right balance among all stakeholders’ competing and legitimate concerns. On one hand, there is reason to worry about certain Internet companies’ concentration of market power, particularly in online content and distribution, and about the effects of new technologies on personal privacy, law enforcement, and national security. On the other hand, new technological advances could deliver immense economic gains. It is easy to envision a scenario of too much regulation, or of too little. It is also easy to envision a large-scale public backlash against the major technology companies, particularly if poor self-policing or a refusal to cooperate with law enforcement leads to some horrible event. Here, I predict that achieving an appropriate policy balance will take years. If some future event strikes an emotional chord, the public’s mood could swing dramatically. Ultimately, however, I suspect that competition and innovation will survive the forthcoming regulations. Finally, and most important, let us hope that terrorism is thwarted everywhere, conflicts subside, democracy and capitalism regain some momentum, and greater civility and honest dialogue return to the public domain. Should that happen in 2018, it will be a very good year indeed.",
            "2018年的世界经济 发自斯坦福 — — 所有主要的宏观经济指标 — — 增长，失业率和通胀率 — — 都表明2017年将是美国经济十年来最好的一年。 全球经济也正享受着超出所有人预期的，广泛而同步的增长。 而如今的问题这在于：这个强劲表现能否在2018年延续下去。 答案无疑将取决于美国和全球各国的货币，财政，贸易等相关政策。 但2018年会出现哪些政策议案是很难预测的。 美法英三国都有了新的国家元首，德国领导人在9月份大选后尚未组成执政联盟；美联储的新主席人选还有待确认。 同时阿根廷，沙特，巴西等重要发展中经济体国内局势的重大变化也使得前景更加阴暗难猜。 不过我们依然会满怀希望。 首先，如国际货币基金组织10月预测的那样，我们可以指望略低于4％的全球经济同步增长率能在2018年得以延续。 经济增长不仅提高了收入，还能使银行不良贷款，预算赤字等问题更加容易应对。 正如美国前总统约翰·F·肯尼迪（John F. Kennedy）在1963年10月一次提议降低企业和个人税率的演讲中所说的那样 ： “ 潮水一涨，万帆皆高 ” 。 在我看来，全球经济复苏将持续，但增速略低，大概在3.5％左右。 最需要注意的两个最明显风险一个是周期性好转局面可能出现停滞的欧洲，以及紧张局势可能再次爆发中东产油区。 其次，让我们希望美联储能在其新主席杰罗姆·鲍威尔（Jerome Powell）的稳定执掌下继续或甚至加快其货币政策正常化进程，一方面提高基准联邦基金利率，另一方面收缩其过度膨胀的资产负债表。 我们也希望经济条件能允许其他主要央行（尤其是欧洲央行）效仿这些举动。 在这方面，我预计各主要央行将会继续逐步实现货币政策正常化。 这里最大的风险在于市场可能试图考验一下新领导人治下的美联储，比如如果通胀上涨速度可能超出预期。 第三，我们希望共和党的一揽子税收方案能够在未来十年内兑现其提升投资，产出，生产力和工资的承诺。 在此我预测立法会通过，而未来几年的对美投资会比不做出任何行动要高。 可以肯定的是，投资能否摆脱当前的低迷水平还得取决于企业税率以外的其他因素。 但税收方案仍然可以提高产出，生产率和工资。 问题不在于能否，而是何时。 如果立法效应无法在2018年或2020年选举之前全部释放，那么这种滞后可能会产生一定的政治后果。 最大的危险在于它的正面效应将会被延后，而其主要条款将会被重夺政权的民主党人所逆转。 第四，让我们希望各地的政府都开始着手解决一项迫在眉睫的危机：几十年来一直在上升的公共养老金和医疗保健成本。 随着社会项目的成本日益上涨，国防等必需品的政府支出遭到了挤占，也令到压抑增长的加税压力不断增大。 欧洲尤其避免在周期性反弹下保持清醒。 许多欧盟成员国仍需缩减政府债务，欧元区则得着手解决“僵尸银行”危机。 除此之外，法国总统马克龙所追求的结构性劳动力市场改革也是最为急需的。 不幸的是我担心结构改革的进展恐怕会是断断续续的。 危险在于缓慢增长无法带来足够的工资收入增长和就业增量以化解许多国家的高青年失业率定时炸弹。 另一项风险在于改革尝试可能会引发一场不利于长期性投资的政治反弹。 第五，希望欧元区能避免货币危机。 这在很大程度上取决于德国总理默克尔能否组建联合政府，让德国这个欧洲最大经济体恢复政治稳定。 第六，我们应寄望欧盟和英国能达成一个合理的脱欧协议以维护双方之间的密切贸易关系。 这里的主要风险是贸易的局部下降可能会蔓延开来并造成更广泛的伤害。 而在欧洲之外，我们希望美国，加拿大和墨西哥三国之间就《北美自由贸易协定》进行的谈判将产生一个仍然有利于北美大陆贸易的安排。 对于贸易来说，最大的风险在于特朗普政府会因为急于扶助美国制造业劳动者而发起一场双输的贸易争端。 第七，让我们希望以信息和通信技术为目标的新政策能够在所有利益相关者的竞争和合理关切之间取得适当的平衡。 一方面，有理由担心某些互联网公司在某些市场 — — 特别是在线内容和分发方面 — — 攫取过大权力，以及新技术对个人隐私，执法和国家安全的影响。 另一方面，新技术进步的巨大经济收益也不容忽视。 监管过多或过少的状况可能出现。 特别是在因自我管理不善或拒绝配合执法而导致一些可怕事件后，公众针对大型科技公司实施大规模反弹也是有可能的。 在此我预测达致适当的政策平衡将需要几年的时间。 如果未来的事件引发情绪上的共鸣，公众的情绪就会剧烈波动。 但我觉得竞争和创新还是可以在即将到来的法规监管中找到生存空间。 最后，也是最重要的是，让我们希望，各地的恐怖主义都能被挫败，冲突消退，民主与资本主义能恢复一些前进的势头，更大范围的文明与诚实的对话能回归公共领域。 如果这一切能在2018年发生，那这将是非常好的一年。"

            "The World Economy Without China NEW HAVEN – Is the Chinese economy about to implode? With its debt overhangs and property bubbles, its zombie state-owned enterprises and struggling banks, China is increasingly portrayed as the next disaster in a crisis-prone world. I remain convinced that such fears are overblown, and that China has the strategy, wherewithal, and commitment to achieve a dramatic structural transformation into a services-based consumer society while successfully dodging daunting cyclical headwinds. But I certainly recognize that this is now a minority opinion. For example, US Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew continues to express the rather puzzling view that the United States “can’t be the only engine in the world economy.” Actually, it’s not: the Chinese economy is on track to contribute well over four times as much to global growth as the US this year. But maybe Lew is already assuming the worst for China in his assessment of the world economy. So what if the China doubters are right? What if China’s economy does indeed come crashing down, with its growth rate plunging into low single digits, or even negative territory, as would be the case in most crisis economies? China would suffer, of course, but so would an already-shaky global economy. With all the handwringing over the Chinese economy, it’s worth considering this thought experiment in detail. For starters, without China, the world economy would already be in recession. China’s growth rate this year appears set to hit 6.7% – considerably higher than most forecasters have been expecting. According to the International Monetary Fund – the official arbiter of global economic metrics – the Chinese economy accounts for 17.3% of world GDP (measured on a purchasing-power-parity basis). A 6.7% increase in Chinese real GDP thus translates into about 1.2 percentage points of world growth. Absent China, that contribution would need to be subtracted from the IMF’s downwardly revised 3.1% estimate for world GDP growth in 2016, dragging it down to 1.9% – well below the 2.5% threshold commonly associated with global recessions. Of course, that’s just the direct effect of a world without China. Then there are cross-border linkages with other major economies. The so-called resource economies – namely, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Russia, and Brazil – would be hit especially hard. As a resource-intensive growth juggernaut, China has transformed these economies, which collectively account for nearly 9% of world GDP. While all of them argue that they have diversified economic structures that are not overly dependent on Chinese commodity demand, currency markets say otherwise: whenever China’s growth expectations are revised – upward or downward – their exchange rates move in tandem. The IMF currently projects that these five economies will contract by a combined 0.7% in 2016, reflecting ongoing recessions in Russia and Brazil and modest growth in the other three. Needless to say, in a China implosion scenario, this baseline estimate would be revised downward significantly. The same would be the case for China’s Asian trading partners – most of which remain export-dependent economies, with the Chinese market their largest source of external demand. That is true not only of smaller Asian developing economies such as Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand, but also of the larger and more developed economies in the region, such as Japan, Korea, and Taiwan. Collectively, these six China-dependent Asian economies make up another 11% of world GDP. A China implosion could easily knock at least one percentage point off their combined growth rate. The United States is also a case in point. China is America’s third-largest and most rapidly growing export market. In a China-implosion scenario, that export demand would all but dry up – knocking approximately 0.2-0.3 percentage points off already subpar US economic growth of around 1.6% in 2016. Finally, there is Europe to consider. Growth in Germany, long the engine of an otherwise sclerotic Continental economy, remains heavily dependent on exports. That is due increasingly to the importance of China – now Germany’s third-largest export market, after the European Union and the United States. In a China implosion scenario, German economic growth could also be significantly lower, dragging down the rest of a German-led Europe. Interestingly, in its just-released October update of the World Economic Outlook, the IMF devotes an entire chapter to what it calls a China spillover analysis – a model-based assessment of the global impacts of a China slowdown. Consistent with the arguments above, the IMF focuses on linkages to commodity exporters, Asian exporters, and what they call “systemic advanced economies” (Germany, Japan, and the US) that would be most exposed to a Chinese downturn. By their reckoning, the impact on Asia would be the largest, followed closely by the resource economies; the sensitivity of the three developed economies is estimated to be about half that of China’s non-Japan Asian trading partners. The IMF research suggests that China’s global spillovers would add about another 25% to the direct effects of China’s growth shortfall. That means that if Chinese economic growth vanished into thin air, in accordance with our thought experiment, the sum of the direct effects (1.2 percentage points of global growth) and indirect spillovers (roughly another 0.3 percentage points) would essentially halve the current baseline estimate of 2016 global growth, from 3.1% to 1.6%. While that would be far short of the record 0.1% global contraction in 2009, it wouldn’t be much different than two earlier deep world recessions, in 1975 (1% growth) and 1982 (0.7%). I may be one of the only China optimists left. While I am hardly upbeat about prospects for the global economy, I think the world faces far bigger problems than a major meltdown in China. Yet I would be the first to concede that a post-crisis world economy without Chinese growth would be in grave difficulty. China bears need to be careful what they wish for.",
            "没有中国的世界经济 纽黑文—中国经济快要崩溃了吗？ 债务堆积和房地产泡沫、国企僵尸化、银行步履维艰，中国被越来越多的人描述成危机重重的世界中的下一场灾难。 我仍然这些担心有些杞人忧天，中国有战略、能力和决心实现伟大的结构转型，成为以服务为基础的消费社会，同时成功地规避巨大的周期性困难。 但我当然也知道目前这是少数人的观点。 比如，美国财政部长雅各布·卢仍然持有相当令人难以理解的观点：美国“无法成为世界经济唯一的引擎 。 ” 事实上它也不是：今年中国经济对全球增长的贡献很有可能是美国的四倍有余。 但也许卢已经在其对世界经济的评估中假设了中国遭遇最坏情形。 那么，如果中国怀疑论者是对的，情况会如何？ 如果中国经济确实正在走向崩溃，其增长如大部分危机经济体一样下降至极低水平乃至负区间，情况会如何？ 固然中国不好受，但已经岌岌可危的全球经济亦然。 在关于中国经济的重重绝望中，有必要详细思考这一思想实验。 首先，没有中国，世界经济已经进入了衰退。 今年中国经济增长率可能为6.7 % — —比大部分预测家的预期显著更高。 据全球经济指标官方“仲裁官 ” — —国际货币基金组织（IMF ） ， 中国经济贡献世界GDP的17.3 % （ 以购买力平价衡量 ） 。 如果没有中国，这一贡献需要从IMF向下修正的2016年世界GDP增长预测（3.1 % ） 中剔除，将世界GDP增长率拉低至1.9 % — —大大低于通常伴随全球衰退出现的阈值2.5 % 。 当然，这只是没有中国的世界的直接影响。 接下来要考虑的是中国与其他主要经济体的跨国联系。 所谓的资源经济体 — — 即澳大利亚、新西兰、加拿大、俄罗斯和巴西 — — 都将遭受重创。 作为资源密集型增长巨兽，中国改变了这些经济体，如今它们加起来占世界GDP的近9 % 。 这些国家均声称经济结构已经实现多元化，不再过度依赖中国大宗商品需求，但货币市场情况表明并非如此：只要中国增长预期调整 — — 不管向上还是向下 — — 它们的汇率也会同步波动。 IMF最近预测，2016年这五个经济体总计将收缩0.7 % ， 其中俄罗斯和巴西继续衰退，其他增长萎靡。 不消说，在中国崩溃的情景中，这一基线预测将大幅向下修正。 中国的亚洲贸易伙伴也是如此 — — 它们大部分仍然是出口依赖型经济，中国市场是它们最大的外部需求源。 不仅规模较小的亚洲发展中经济体是这样，如印度尼西亚、菲律宾和泰国等；域内规模较大较发达的经济体也是这样，如日本、韩国和台湾。 这六个依赖中国的亚洲经济体加起来也占世界GDP的11 % 。 中国崩溃至少会让它们的总增长率下降一个百分点。 美国也无法独善其身。 中国是美国的第三大也是增长最快的出口市场。 在中国崩溃情形中，这一出口需求将干涸 — — 大约会将2016年美国经济增长率拉低0.2—0.3个百分点，而美国经济原本已相当疲软，预计增长率只有1.6%左右。 最后来考虑欧洲。 长期以来，德国一直是独自支撑欧洲大陆的经济引擎，其增长仍严重依赖出口。 而中国的重要性越来越显著 — — 现在它是德国第三大出口市场，仅次于欧盟和美国。 在中国崩溃情形中，德国经济增长也将显著下降，拖累��他依靠德国拉动的欧洲国家。 有趣的是，在刚刚发布的《世界经济展望》10月份修订版中，IMF用了一整章内容进行所谓的中国溢出效应分析，即基于模型评估中国减速的全球影响。 与上面所罗列的观点类似，IMF重点关注中国与大宗商品出口国、亚洲出口国以及它所谓的“系统性发达经济体 ” （ 德国、日本和美国）的联系，这些国家最容易受到中国减速的波及。 在IMF的分析中，亚洲受到的影响最大，其次是资源经济体；三个发达经济体的敏感性预计为中国的日本以外的亚洲贸易伙伴的一半左右。 IMF研究表明，中国的全球溢出效应将让中国增长缺口的直接效应放大25 % 。 这意味着如果中国经济增长消失，那么根据我们的思想实验，总直接影响（全球增长下降1.2个百分点）和间接溢出效应（额外的0.3个百分点）将让当前2016年全球增长基线估计值下降一半，3.1%降至1.6 % 。 这距离2009年创纪录的全球经济收缩0.1%仍然相去甚远，但与1975年（增长1 % ） 和1982年（0.7 % ） 两次深度世界衰退已经相当接近。 我大概是仅有的中国乐观论者。 我很少对全球经济前景感到乐观，但我认为世界所面临的问题要比中国大崩溃严重得多。 然而我将第一个承认危机后的世界经济没了中国增长将陷入巨大的困难。 中国悲观论者需要对自己想要的结果三思。"

            "Trade and the Future of Food GENEVA – No one can survive without food. And yet, the world’s food systems are badly in need of reform. To ensure universal access to adequate nutrition, as well as long-term environmental sustainability, we need to change how we produce, process, transport, and consume food. World Food Day should spur us to consider how to achieve this, and to recognize that trade must be part of the solution. The recent United Nations Food Systems Summit highlighted not only the need for comprehensive reforms, but also the key role that governments must play in improving how food markets function. This will require deeper international cooperation. As the COVID-19 pandemic has reminded us, joint action is essential to enable all people to live healthy and dignified lives. Barriers to trade in basic necessities, such as food and medicine, frustrate efforts to improve nutrition and health, thereby undermining the basis of future prosperity. By contrast, effective trade can reduce hunger and malnutrition not only by ensuring the delivery of food supplies, but also by creating decent work and raising incomes. The urgency of the problem has become undeniable. We already know that climate change is altering temperature and precipitation patterns and leading to more frequent and extreme weather events – all of which can wreak havoc on food production. In such an unstable and unpredictable context, global food markets provide a lifeline to countries or regions facing sudden shocks. We are already falling behind. In 2015, the world adopted the Sustainable Development Goals, including SDG 2, which calls for ending world hunger, achieving food security and improved nutrition, and promoting sustainable agriculture by 2030. Six years later, we are nowhere close to being on track to achieving these targets. On the contrary, we seem to be moving backwards, buffeted by headwinds like the pandemic, economic downturns, violent conflict, and climate-related shocks. In fact, hunger and malnutrition rose substantially in 2020: according to the UN, some 9.9% of the world population is estimated to have been undernourished last year, up from 8.4% in 2019. To reverse this trend and ensure that food systems work for people and the planet, governments must redouble their efforts to update global rules on trade. At the same time, they must abandon policies that distort the rapidly evolving global food market. For example, governments spend $22 billion each year to keep economically unviable fishing fleets at sea – a policy that drives depletion of fish stocks. Farm-support programs can similarly distort food and agricultural markets, with fossil-fuel subsidies compounding the effects. Governments must find new ways to reverse underinvestment in public goods relating to food and agriculture, especially in low-income countries, while improving the global allocation of scarce resources. Here, they should take advantage of the growing importance of digital trade and services in poor countries. The challenge may seem daunting. But, with an incremental approach, progress is possible. Next month, at the World Trade Organization’s 12th ministerial conference in Geneva, trade ministers will have an opportunity to devise just such an approach and take important steps forward. For example, ministers will consider how to end harmful fishery subsidies, which contribute to overfishing and overcapacity, and threaten to drive some species to extinction. Countries could also agree to exempt the UN World Food Programme’s humanitarian food aid purchases from export restrictions, thereby making food more accessible to the world’s poor and those displaced by internal strife or the effects of climate change. Moreover, ministers will have an opportunity to drive forward negotiations on a slate of issues relating to agricultural trade including cuts in trade-distorting government subsidies and improved access to foreign markets. Here, agreement on concrete measures, as well as on the direction of future talks, would amount to tangible progress toward the food future we need. World Food Day offers an important opportunity to remember how and why food matters to people. But we must not forget the vital role trade plays in shaping the production, availability, pricing, and quality of that food. No effort to create a more equitable and sustainable food system will be complete without world leaders’ concerted action on trade.",
            "贸易与粮食的未来 日内瓦—没有粮食，任何人都无法生存。 然而，世界粮食系统急需改革。 为了确保人人获得充足的营养以及实现长期环境可持续性，我们需要改变我们生产、加工、运输和消费粮食的方式。 世界粮食日应该激励我们考虑如何实现这一目标，并认识到贸易必须是解决方案的一部分。 最近的联合国粮食系统峰会不仅强调了全面改革的必要性，还强调了政府在改善粮食市场运作方式方面必须发挥关键作用。 这需要更深入的国际合作。 新冠疫情提醒我们，为了让所有人都能过上健康和有尊严的生活，联合行动至关重要。 食品和药品等基本必需品的贸易壁垒阻碍了改善营养和健康的努力，进而破坏了未来繁荣的基础。 相反，有效的贸易不仅可以确保粮食供应，而且可以创造体面的工作和提高收入来，从而减少饥饿和营养不良。 问题的紧迫性不容否认。 我们已经知道，气候变化正在改变温度和降水模式，导致更频繁和更极端的天气事件 — — 所有这些都可能对粮食生产造成严重破坏。 在如此不稳定和不可预测的背景下，全球粮食市场为面临突然冲击的国家或地区提供了生命线。 我们已经落后了。 2015 年，世界通过了可持续发展目标（Sustainable Development Goals，SDG ） ， 其中的SDG 2要求到 2030 年消除世界饥饿，实现粮食安全和改善营养，促进可持续农业。 六年过去了，我们距离实现目标没有任何进展。 相反，我们似乎在倒退，受到疫情、经济下滑、暴力冲突和和气候相关的冲击等不利因素的冲击。 事实上，饥饿和营养不良在 2020 年大幅增多：据联合国估计，去年约有 9.9% 的世界人口营养不良，高于 2019 年的 8.4 % 。 为了扭转这一趋势，确保粮食系统为人类和地球服务，各国政府必须加倍努力更新全球贸易规则。 与此同时，他们必须放弃扭曲快速演化的全球粮食市场的政策。 例如，政府每年花费 220 亿美元来维持经济上不可行的海捕船队 — — 这一政策导致鱼类资源枯竭。 农场支持计划同样会扭曲粮食和农业市场，化石燃料补贴会加剧这种影响。 The challenge may seem daunting. But, with an incremental approach, progress is possible. Next month, at the World Trade Organization’s 12th ministerial conference in Geneva, trade ministers will have an opportunity to devise just such an approach and take important steps forward. 挑战似乎令人生畏。 但是，采用渐进式方法，取得进展是可能的。 下个月，在日内瓦举行的世界贸易组织第 12 次部长级会议上，各国贸易部长将有机会制定这样一套方针，迈出重要一步。 例如，部长们将考虑如何终止有害的渔业补贴，这些补贴会导致过度捕捞和产能过剩，甚至让某些物种灭绝。 各国还可能同意对联合国世界粮食署的人道主义粮食援助采购豁免出口限制，从而使世界上的穷人和因内乱或气候变化影响而流离失所的人更容易获得粮食。 此外，部长们也将有机会推动与农业贸易有关的一系列问题的谈判，包括削减扭曲贸易的政府补贴、改善外国市场准入等。 在这方面，就具体措施以及未来谈判的方向达成一致，便是朝着我们需要的粮食未来取得切实进展。 世界粮食日提供了一个重要的机会来铭记粮食如何以及为何对人类重要。 但我们绝不能忘记贸易在决定粮食生产、供应、价格和质量方面所发挥的重要作用。 没有世界领导人在贸易问题上的一致行动，任何建立更加公平、更可持续的粮食系统的努力都将是不完整的。"

            "The Return of Currency Wars NEW YORK – The recent decision by the Bank of Japan to increase the scope of its quantitative easing is a signal that another round of currency wars may be under way. The BOJ’s effort to weaken the yen is a beggar-thy-neighbor approach that is inducing policy reactions throughout Asia and around the world. Central banks in China, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, and Thailand, fearful of losing competitiveness relative to Japan, are easing their own monetary policies – or will soon ease more. The European Central Bank and the central banks of Switzerland, Sweden, Norway, and a few Central European countries are likely to embrace quantitative easing or use other unconventional policies to prevent their currencies from appreciating. All of this will lead to a strengthening of the US dollar, as growth in the United States is picking up and the Federal Reserve has signaled that it will begin raising interest rates next year. But, if global growth remains weak and the dollar becomes too strong, even the Fed may decide to raise interest rates later and more slowly to avoid excessive dollar appreciation. The cause of the latest currency turmoil is clear: In an environment of private and public deleveraging from high debts, monetary policy has become the only available tool to boost demand and growth. Fiscal austerity has exacerbated the impact of deleveraging by exerting a direct and indirect drag on growth. Lower public spending reduces aggregate demand, while declining transfers and higher taxes reduce disposable income and thus private consumption. In the eurozone, a sudden stop of capital flows to the periphery and the fiscal restraints imposed, with Germany’s backing, by the European Union, the International Monetary Fund, and the ECB have been a massive impediment to growth. In Japan, an excessively front-loaded consumption-tax increase killed the recovery achieved this year. In the US, a budget sequester and other tax and spending policies led to a sharp fiscal drag in 2012-2014. And in the United Kingdom, self-imposed fiscal consolidation weakened growth until this year. Globally, the asymmetric adjustment of creditor and debtor economies has exacerbated this recessionary and deflationary spiral. Countries that were overspending, under-saving, and running current-account deficits have been forced by markets to spend less and save more. Not surprisingly, their trade deficits have been shrinking. But most countries that were over-saving and under-spending have not saved less and spent more; their current-account surpluses have been growing, aggravating the weakness of global demand and thus undermining growth. As fiscal austerity and asymmetric adjustment have taken their toll on economic performance, monetary policy has borne the burden of supporting faltering growth via weaker currencies and higher net exports. But the resulting currency wars are partly a zero-sum game: If one currency is weaker, another currency must be stronger; and if one country’s trade balance improves, another’s must worsen. Of course, monetary easing is not purely zero-sum. Easing can boost growth by lifting asset prices (equities and housing), reducing private and public borrowing costs, and limiting the risk of a fall in actual and expected inflation. Given fiscal drag and private deleveraging, lack of sufficient monetary easing in recent years would have led to double and triple dip recession (as occurred, for example, in the eurozone). But the overall policy mix has been sub-optimal, with too much front-loaded fiscal consolidation and too much unconventional monetary policy (which has become less effective over time). A better approach in advanced economies would have comprised less fiscal consolidation in the short run and more investment in productive infrastructure, combined with a more credible commitment to medium- and long-term fiscal adjustment – and less aggressive monetary easing. You can lead a horse to liquidity, but you can’t make it drink. In a world where private aggregate demand is weak and unconventional monetary policy eventually becomes like pushing on a string, the case for slower fiscal consolidation and productive public infrastructure spending is compelling. Such spending offers returns that are certainly higher than the low interest rates that most advanced economies face today, and infrastructure needs are massive in both advanced and emerging economies (with the exception of China, which has overinvested in infrastructure). Moreover, public investment works on both the demand and supply sides. It not only boosts aggregate demand directly; it also expands potential output by increasing the stock of productivity-boosting capital. Unfortunately, the political economy of austerity has led to sub-optimal outcomes. In a fiscal crunch, the first spending cuts hit productive public investments, because governments prefer to protect current – and often inefficient – spending on public-sector jobs and transfer payments to the private sector. As a result, the global recovery remains anemic in most advanced economies (with the partial exception of the US and the UK) and now also in the major emerging countries, where growth has slowed sharply in the last two years. The right policies – less fiscal austerity in the short run, more public investment spending, and less reliance on monetary easing – are the opposite of those that have been pursued by the world’s major economies. No wonder global growth keeps on disappointing. In a sense, we are all Japanese now.",
            "货币战争回归 纽约—日本银行最近决定提高量化宽松范围，这表明新一轮货币战争可能已经箭在弦上。 日本银行的日元贬值政策是一种以邻为壑策略，正在导致整个亚洲和全世界的政策反应。 中国、韩国、中国台湾、新加坡和泰国等地的央行担心丧失相对日本的竞争力，正在放松各自的货币政策 — — 并且很快会加码放松。 欧洲央行和瑞士、瑞典、挪威以及一些中欧国家的央行也可能采取量化宽松或采用其他非常规政策阻止货币升值。 所有这些将导致美元升值，因为美国增长抬头和美联储表明将从明年开始提高利率。 但是，如果全球增长保持疲软而美元表现出过度强劲，即使是美联储也可能决定延后和更加缓慢地升息以避免美元过度升值。 新的货币战争动荡的根源很明确：在公共和私人部门从高债务状态去杠杆化的环境中，货币政策已成为唯一可行的刺激需求和增长的工具。 财政紧缩产生直接和间接的增长拖累，放大了去杠杆化的影响。 公共支出缩减降低了总需求，而转移支付下降和税收升高降低了可支配收入，从而降低了私人消费。 在欧元区，流向外围的资本流的突然中断以及欧盟、国际货币基金组织（IMF）和欧洲央行在德国的支持下所施加的财政约束已经形成了巨大的增长阻碍。 在日本，过度前瞻（front-loaded）的消费税提升扼杀了去年实现的复苏。 在美国，预算自动减赤（sequester）和其他税收和支出政策导致了巨大的2012—2014年财政拖累。 而在英国，自我施加的财政整合削弱了增长，直到今年才有所好转。 放眼全球，债权经济体和债务经济体的不对称调整恶化了这一衰退和通缩螺旋。 过度支出、储蓄不足、存在经常项目赤字的国家受市场逼迫削减支出、增加储蓄。 毫不奇怪，它们的贸易赤字一直在减小。 但大部分过度储蓄、支出不足的国家并没有减少储蓄、增加支出；它们的经常项目盈余一直在增加，加剧了全球需求的疲软，因而拖累增长。 财政紧缩和不对称调整已经对经济表现产生了影响，因此货币政策承担了通过货币贬值和提高净出口支持弱势增长的重任。 但由此导致的货币战争在某种程度上是一个零和博弈：如果一种货币贬值，必有另一种货币升值；如果一国贸易盈余改善，必有另一国贸易盈余恶化。 当然��货币宽松并非纯零和博弈。 宽松可以通过提升资产价格（股票和房地产）刺激增长、降低私人和公共借贷成本、限制实际和预期通胀下降。 在财政拖累和私人去杠杆化的环境下，近几年来如果货币宽松不足，可能导致二次甚至三次探底（比如，欧元区就发生了这一幕 ） 。 但总体政策组合只是次优水平，前瞻财政整合和非常规货币政策（随着时间的推移，这一政策效果越来越差）过多。 发达经济体更好的方针应该是短期减少财政整合和增加生产性基础设施投资，同时许以可信的中期和长期财政调整承诺 — — 以及更温和的货币宽松。 你可以把马拉到水边，但你不能强迫它喝水。 在私人总需求疲软、非常规货币政策最终效果消失时，减缓财政整合和生产性公共基础设施支出就成为不可缺少的要件。 在如今大部分发达经济体的低利率环境下，这类支出的回报必然会更高，而不管是发达经济体还是新兴经济体都需要大量基础设施（中国除外，它存在基础设施投资过度的问题 ） 。 此外，公共投资对需求和供给端都能起作用。 它不仅直接提振总需求；也通过增加能提高生产率的资本扩大了潜在产出。 不幸的是，紧缩的政治经济学导致了次优结果。 在财政动荡中，第一批支出削减就来自生产性公共投资，因为政府偏好保护当前 — — 通常效率低下 — — 的公共部门就业和向私人部门的转移支付支出。 结果，全球复苏在大部分发达经济体毫无起色（美国和英国勉强算得上例外 ） ， 目前在新兴国家也是如此，它们的增长在过去两年中显著放缓。 正确的政策 — — 减少短期财政紧缩、增加公共投资支出、减少货币宽松依赖 — — 与世界主要经济体所追求的政策截然相反。 毫不奇怪全球增长一直令人失望。 从某种程度上讲，现在我们都是日本人。"

            "A Roadmap to End Cholera GENEVA – “Where is your toilet?” This is often the first question I ask when I visit the site of a cholera outbreak anywhere in the world. More often than not, the answer is: “We don’t have one. We go wherever we can.” Cholera, an ancient disease, has become a disease of poverty. It does not discriminate geographically, but it preys mostly on vulnerable communities in areas with poor sanitation. Carried by contaminated floodwaters to sources of drinking water, transported by unsuspecting travelers, or brought into homes on produce irrigated with untreated sewage, the Vibrio cholerae bacterium settles in the small intestine after it is ingested, causing severe diarrhea and dehydration. Those who are fortunate enough never to have witnessed cholera’s effects firsthand might assume that it is just another stomach bug. But without swift medical attention, cholera can sap the life out of an adult or child in a matter of hours. Each year, cholera claims the lives of an estimated 95,000 people; many who die are children. This year, images of listless, glassy-eyed cholera victims awaiting treatment have emerged in countries worldwide. The disease has spread at an unprecedented rate in Yemen, where more than 2,000 people have died since April. Cholera outbreaks are ongoing in Somalia, South Sudan, Haiti, and other countries across sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. But the saddest fact about cholera’s recent toll on human lives is that every single death was preventable. The world already has the knowledge and tools to control cholera effectively, but existing resources are not being aligned with the necessary global commitments. That is why the new global strategy developed by the Global Task Force on Cholera Control, a diverse network of technical partners, is so vital. Ending Cholera – A Global Roadmap to 2030 emphasizes a shift to proactive approaches, and aims to reduce cholera deaths by 90% over the next decade. With full implementation, the plan could also help as many as 20 countries eliminate disease transmission in the same timeframe. Based on three pillars – early detection, integrated prevention tactics, and coordination between countries and partners – the roadmap provides a concrete path for ending cholera as a public health threat. Once cholera grips a community, it becomes increasingly difficult to control. It is important, therefore, that the disease is not forgotten even when it is not claiming victims. A multi-sector approach that includes investments in water, sanitation, and hygiene – so-called WASH services – can keep cholera at bay. So can the proactive use of oral cholera vaccines and quick access to treatments, such as oral rehydration solution and intravenous fluids. Improving WASH infrastructure is the most effective path to prevention, though implementing these services will take time in countries with fewer resources. For this reason, the roadmap also encourages the preemptive and large-scale deployment of oral vaccines in cholera hotspots. The vaccines work immediately, and can prevent cholera for up to three years, serving as a bridge to the implementation of longer-term solutions. Oral cholera vaccines are available via a global stockpile maintained by the World Health Organization, with support from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. More than 15 million doses have been distributed to 18 countries since the program’s creation in 2013. Next year, the stockpile is set to increase to more than 25 million doses, up from two million when it began. Ending cholera as a health threat by 2030, as global partners and the WHO recently pledged, will require sustained collaboration and commitment from cholera-affected countries, technical partners, and international donors. The goal may seem daunting, given that millions of people around the world are at risk of contracting the disease each year. But with urbanization, climate change, and other factors likely to increase the threat of infection, it is a goal that must be met. The roadmap makes this possible. Implementing the plan will prove to be a cost-effective solution for countries saddled with responding to frequent cholera outbreaks. That is one reason why action is urgently needed. But embracing the strategy is also the right thing to do for the international community. Governments have a moral obligation to ensure that no one succumbs to a preventable death. It is an obligation the WHO shares, and it is why we will work hard to help the world meet the ambitious targets we have set. We have the tools needed to beat cholera. Now, with a plan in place, there can no longer be any excuse not to put them to use.",
            "消灭霍乱路线图 日内瓦 — “ 请问洗手间在哪 ？ ” 每当我访问霍乱爆发地区，这常常是我问的第一个问题。 更多时候，我获得的回答是“我们没有洗手间。 哪里方便就在哪里解决 。 ” 霍乱这个古老的病种，如今已经成为贫穷病。 它本身不具有地理区别，但主要在卫生设施落后的脆弱社区传播。 携带霍乱弧菌的洪水进入到饮用水水源，然后被毫无戒心的旅行者传播，或进入用未处理过的污水进行灌溉的家庭，被摄入人体后栖息于小肠，引发严重腹泻和脱水。 那些从未亲眼目睹霍乱影响的幸运儿，可能会认为这无非是有一种肠胃病。 但如果不迅速进行治疗，霍乱可能会在几个小时内夺走成年人或儿童的生命。 每年，霍乱都会导致大约95,000人死亡；其中许多是儿童。 今年，无精打采、双目无神的待治疗霍乱患者的形象出现在世界各国。 这种疾病以前所未有的速度在也门传播，4月份以来已造成2,000多人死亡。 索马里、南苏丹、海地和其他许多撒哈拉以南非洲和亚洲国家也发生了霍乱疫情爆发。 但关于最近的致命霍乱疫情的最令人悲哀的事实是每个人的死亡其实都是可以避免的。 世界早已掌握了有效控制霍乱的知识和工具，但现有资源与必要的全球承诺不相匹配。 因此，多元化的技术合作网络 — — 全球霍乱控制任务小组（Global Task Force on Cholera Control）至关重要。 《消灭霍乱 — — 2030年全球路线图 》 （ Ending Cholera – A Global Roadmap to 2030）强调要转向积极预防方针，制定了在未来十年让霍乱致死人数减少90%的目标。 如果能得到全面实施，该计划将帮助多达20个国家在相同的时间框架内根除霍乱传播。 该路线图基于三个支柱 — — 早期监测、集中预防以及国家和合作伙伴间的合作 — — 为消灭作为公共卫生威胁的霍乱提供了非常具体的路径。 一旦霍乱在一个社区内爆发，就会日益难以控制。 因此，很重要的一点是，即使没有报告病例，也不能将它遗忘。 包括了水、下水道设施和卫生（所谓的WASH服务）投资在内的多部门方针能够将霍乱控制在未萌发状态。 用口服霍乱疫苗进行预防和快速治疗手段（如口服补水剂和静脉注射）也能起到同样的作用。 改善WASH基础设施是最有效的预防方法，尽管在资源匮乏国家落实这些服务需要时间。 因此，路线图还鼓励在霍乱高发地区预防性地大量配置口服疫苗。 疫苗能够立刻起作用，在三年内防止霍乱爆发，为实施长期解决方案争取时间。 口服霍乱疫苗可以通过世界卫生组织在Gavi即疫苗联盟的支持下维持的全球储备获得。 自2013年该计划成立以来，已有超过1,500剂疫苗分配给18个国家。 明年，疫苗储备将增加到2,500万剂以上，而成立之初只有两百万剂。 要在2030年前消灭作为卫生威胁的霍乱 — — 这是全球合作伙伴和世卫组织最新做出的承诺 — — 需要来自受霍乱影响的国家、技术合作伙伴和国际捐赠者的持续合作和致力。 考虑到如今全世界每年仍有数百万人有可能沾染霍乱，这一目标似乎非常艰巨。 但在城市化、气候变化和其他因素有可能让传染风险进一步加剧的情况下，我们必须实现这一目标。 路线图让它成为可能。 实施路线图计划将是饱受霍乱反复爆发的国家性价比最高的解决方案。 这也是急需行动起来的原因之一。 但对国际社会来说，采纳这一战略也是一件正确的事。 政府有确保所有人都不会遭遇可预防死亡的道德义务。 这也是世界卫生组织的义务，因此，我们将努力帮助世界实现我们所制定的雄心勃勃的目标。 我们拥有战胜霍乱所需要的工具。 现在，我们又有了计划，没有任何借口不把计划和工具落到实处。"

            "The Chinese Health Organization? NEW DELHI – The COVID-19 pandemic, much like a major war, is a defining moment for the world – one that demands major reforms of international institutions. The World Health Organization, whose credibility has taken a severe beating of late, is a good place to start. The WHO is the only institution that can provide global health leadership. But, at a time when such leadership is urgently needed, the body has failed miserably. Before belatedly declaring the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic on March 11, the WHO provided conflicting and confusing guidance. More damaging, it helped China, where the crisis originated, to cover its tracks. It is now widely recognized that China’s political culture of secrecy helped to turn a local viral outbreak into the greatest global disaster of our time. Far from sounding the alarm when the new coronavirus was detected in Wuhan, the Communist Party of China (CPC) concealed the outbreak, allowing it to spread far and wide. Months later, China continues to sow doubt about the pandemic’s origins and withhold potentially life-saving data. The WHO has been complicit in this deception. Instead of attempting independently to verify Chinese claims, the WHO took them at face value – and disseminated them to the world. In mid-January, the body tweeted that investigations by Chinese authorities had found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the virus. Taiwan’s December 31 warning that such transmission was likely happening in Wuhan was ignored by the WHO, even though the information had been enough to convince the Taiwanese authorities – which may have better intelligence on China than anyone else – to institute preventive measures at home before any other country, including China. The WHO’s persistent publicizing of China’s narrative lulled other countries into a dangerous complacency, delaying their responses by weeks. In fact, the WHO actively discouraged action. On January 10, with Wuhan gripped by the outbreak, the WHO said that it did “not recommend any specific health measures for travelers to and from Wuhan,” adding that “entry screening offers little benefit.” It also advised “against the application of any travel or trade restrictions on China.” Even after China’s most famous pulmonologist, Zhong Nanshan, confirmed human-to-human transmission on January 20, the WHO continued to undermine effective responses by downplaying the risks of asymptomatic transmission and discouraging widespread testing. Meanwhile, China was hoarding personal protective equipment – scaling back exports of Chinese-made PPE and other medical gear and importing the rest of the world’s supply. In the final week of January, the country imported 56 million respirators and masks, according to official data. By the time the WHO finally labeled the epidemic a public-health emergency on January 30, travelers from China had carried COVID-19 to far-flung corners of the world, including Australia, Brazil, France, and Germany. Yet, when Australia, India, Indonesia, Italy, and the US imposed restrictions on travel from China, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus roundly criticized the actions, arguing that they would increase “fear and stigma, with little public-health benefit.” At the same time, Tedros extolled Chinese President Xi Jinping’s “very rare leadership” and China’s “transparency.” The bias has been so pronounced that Japanese Deputy Prime Minister Taro Aso recently noted that, for many, the WHO is looking more like the “CHO” – the Chinese Health Organization. Yet, despite the WHO’s repeated deference to China, the authorities there did not allow a WHO team to visit until mid-February. Three of the team’s 12 members were allowed to visit Wuhan, but no one was granted access to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, the high-containment laboratory from which a natural coronavirus derived from bats is rumored to have escaped. In fact, a study conducted at the South China University of Technology in Guangzhou with support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China concluded in February that “the killer coronavirus probably originated from a laboratory in Wuhan” working on bat coronaviruses. China did not always enjoy deferential treatment from the WHO. When the first twenty-first-century pandemic – severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) – emerged from China in 2002, the agency publicly rebuked the Chinese authorities for concealing vital information in what proved to be a costly cover-up. Why has the WHO changed its tune? The answer is not money: China remains a relatively small contributor to the WHO’s $6 billion budget. The issue is the WHO’s leadership. Tedros, who became the agency’s first non-physician chief in 2017 with China’s support, was accused of covering up three cholera outbreaks while serving as Ethiopia’s health minister. Nonetheless, few would have imagined that, as WHO chief, the microbiologist and malaria researcher would be complicit in China’s deadly deception. The WHO’s faltering response to the 2014 Ebola outbreak underscored the imperative for reforms before Tedros was at the helm of the agency. But, rather than overseeing the needed changes, Tedros has allowed political considerations to trump public health. As the costs of the mismanagement continue to mount, a reckoning is becoming all but inevitable. An online petition calling for Tedros to resign has garnered almost a million signatures. More consequential, President Donald Trump’s administration has suspended the WHO’s US funding, which accounts for 9.2% of its budget. The world needs the WHO. But if the agency is to spearhead international health policy and respond to disease outbreaks effectively, it must pursue deep reforms aimed at broadening its jurisdiction and authority. That won’t happen unless and until the WHO rebuilds its credibility beginning with new leadership.",
            "中国卫生组织? 新德里—同重大战争一样，2019新冠状病毒疫病（COVID-19）大流行是世界的决定性时刻，这需要对国际机构进行重大改革。 世界卫生组织(World Health Organization)是一个不错的起点，不过它的信誉近来遭受了严重打击。 世界卫生组织（WHO）是唯一能够提供全球卫生领导的机构。 但是，在迫切需要这样的领导的时候，该机构却在领导工作上惨败。 在3月11日晚些时候宣布新冠状病毒疫病（COVID-19）爆发为大流行前，世卫组织提供了相互矛盾和令人困惑的指导。 更糟糕的是，它帮助危机发源地中国掩盖了自己的行为。 现在人们普遍认识到，中国的保密性政治文化促使这场局部的病毒疫情爆发，导致疫情成为了我们这个时代最大的全球灾难。 当这种新型冠状病毒在武汉被发现时，中国共产党 (CPC) 非但没有发出警报，反而掩盖了疫情爆发的消息，使病毒广泛传播。 几个月后，中国继续对这种流行病的起源表示怀疑，并保留了可能挽救生命的数据。 世界卫生组织是这场骗局的同谋。 世界卫生组织没有试图独立核实中国的声明，而是照单全收，并将其传播给全世界。 1月中旬，世卫组织在推特上表示，中国当局的调查没有发现明确的证据表明这种病毒在人与人之间传播。 台湾方面在12月31日警告说，这种传播很可能最初发生在武汉，但世界卫生组织对此置之不理。 尽管这些信息足以说服台湾当局（台湾当局可能比任何其他国家都掌握更多有关中国的情报）先于中国大陆以及其他国家，采取预防措施。 世界卫生组织持续按照中国的说法公布中国情况，让其他国家陷入了危险的自满情绪，使他们对疫情传播的反应延迟了数周。 事实上，世卫组织积极开展劝阻行动。 随着疫情在武汉爆发，世界卫生组织在1月10日表示 ， “ 不建议对进出武汉的旅客采取任何具体的健康措施 ” ， 并补充说 ， “ 入境检查几乎没有什么好处 。 ” 世卫组织还建议“不要对中国实施任何旅行或贸易限制 。 ” 即使在中国最著名的肺科医生钟南山于1月20日证实了（病毒会）人传人之后，世卫组织继续通过淡化无症状传播的风险和阻止广泛的检测来削弱有效的应对措施。 与此同时，中国持续囤积个人防护装备，减少中国制造的个人防护装备和其他医疗设备的出口，并进口世界其他地区的供应。 官方数据显示，今年1月的最后一周，中国进口了5,600万个口罩和防护口罩。 1月30日，当世界卫生组织终于将该疾病列为公共卫生紧急事件时，携带新冠状病毒（COVID-19）的中国旅行者已把病毒带到包括澳大利亚、巴西、法国和德国等在内的世界各个角落。 然而，当澳大利亚、印度、印度尼西亚、意大利和美国对来自中国的旅行实施限制时，世卫组织总干事谭德塞·阿达诺姆·盖布雷耶苏斯（Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus）严厉批评了这些措施，他这些措施将增加“恐惧和耻辱，并对公共卫生几乎没有好处 ” 。 与此同时，谭德塞高度赞扬了中国国家主席习近平“罕见的领导力”和中国（抗疫措施）的“透明度 ” 。 这种偏见过于明显。 日本副首相麻生太郎最近还指出，世界卫生组织不如说是“CHO ” ， 即“中国卫生组织 ” 。 然而，尽管世界卫生组织一再对中国表示尊重，但中国当局直到2月中旬才允许世界卫生组织的一个小组访问中国。 该小组的12名成员中有3人获准访问武汉，但没有人获准进入武汉病毒学研究所。 据传闻，一种从蝙蝠身上提取的天然冠状病毒曾从该实验室的高防护级别实验室中流出。 事实上，在中国国家自然科学基金会的支持下，华南理工大学在广州进行的一项研究于2月份得出结论 ， “ 致死冠状病毒可能来自武汉的一个研究蝙蝠冠状病毒的实验室 ” 。 中国并不总是受到世界卫生组织的恭敬对待。 2002年，当严重急性呼吸系统综合症(SARS ) — —第一次21世纪疫病大流行 — — 在中国爆发时，世卫组织公开指责中国政府隐瞒重要信息。 事实证明，这是一场代价高昂的掩盖行为。 为什么世界卫生组织改变了态度? 答案并非是资金因素：中国对世界卫生组织60亿美元的预算，在世卫组织的贡献相对较小。 其原因在于世卫组织的领导层。 在中国的支持下，谭德塞于2017年成为该机构的首位非医师出身的干事，他被指控在担任埃塞俄比亚卫生部长期间掩盖了三起霍乱疫情。 尽管如此，很少有人会想到，作为世卫组织总干事、微生物学家和疟疾研究人员的谭德塞会与中国串通一气。 世卫组织对2014年埃博拉疫情的反应迟缓，突显出在谭德塞掌舵该机构之前，机构改革势在必行。 但是，谭德塞并没有监督必要的机构改革，而是允许政治考虑凌驾于公共卫生之上。 谭德塞管理不善导致成本不断上升，清算几乎是不可避免的。 一份要求谭德塞辞职的网上请愿书已经获得了近100万个签名。 更重要的是，美国政府已经暂停了美国向世界卫生组织(WHO)的资助，该资助占其预算的9.2 % 。 世界需要世界卫生组织。 但是，如果世卫组织要成为执行国际卫生政策的先锋并有效应对疾病暴发，它就必须进行深入改革，以扩大其管辖权、提高其权威。 想要出现这种改革，世界卫生组织必须启用新任领导人重建其信誉。"

            "The Global Hunger Crisis Is Here DUBAI – Global food prices are soaring. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization’s Food Price Index – which covers a basket of basic food commodities (cereals, meat, dairy, vegetable oils, and sugar) – reached an all-time high of 159.7 in March, up from 141.1 the previous month. While it declined slightly in April, to 158.5, ongoing developments – not least Russia’s war in Ukraine – are set to keep driving prices to new highs, with devastating implications for global hunger. The COVID-19 pandemic exposed the fragility and dysfunctionality of the world’s food systems, with movement restrictions and supply-chain disruptions driving up prices, damaging rural livelihoods, and exacerbating food insecurity, especially for the poor. Now, the war in Ukraine is compounding these challenges, because both sides are major exporters of food, fuel, and fertilizer. Moreover, climate change poses an even larger threat to global food security. Already, extreme weather like heatwaves, floods, and prolonged droughts has triggered shocks to agricultural production and food availability. As temperatures rise, these shocks will become increasingly frequent and powerful. If global warming crosses the 1.5° Celsius threshold (relative to Earth’s pre-industrial temperature), they are likely to become catastrophic. As the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report shows, avoiding the threshold will require immediate and drastic action. But mitigation is only part of the challenge. Large-scale investments in adaptation will also be needed to protect vulnerable communities from the warming that is already locked in. Even under the most optimistic mitigation scenario, global warming is expected to hit the 1.5°C threshold in a decade, before receding. This will result in shifts in climatic zones, rising sea levels, and disruptions to the water cycle that increase the frequency and intensity of extreme weather. Beyond raising economic and health risks, the resulting disruptions to food and water supplies are likely to drive social and political upheaval, fueling a vicious cycle of poverty, hunger, instability, and even conflict, accompanied by sharp rise in migration. A more resilient, sustainable, and equitable food system must be a pillar of any climate mitigation or adaptation agenda. But the barriers to building such a system should not be underestimated, especially for countries and regions where soil is poor, land has little agricultural value, other natural resources, such as water, are limited or degraded, and socioeconomic conditions are difficult. Given the low productivity of their agricultural land, such marginal environments are unable to support the sustainable production of sufficient food to meet local people’s nutritional needs. In fact, while marginal environments are home to less than 25% of the global population – an estimated 1.7 billion people – they account for 70% of the world’s poor and most of its malnourished. Poverty and hunger can lead farmers to overuse fragile environmental resources in order to ensure their short-term survival, even at the cost of long-term depletion of their lands and impoverishment of their households and communities. Those living in remote areas with minimal infrastructure, few alternative economic opportunities, and limited market access are particularly likely to make such choices. Given this, countries with significant marginal lands rely on food imports – in some cases for more than 80% of their needs. But pandemic- and war-related disruptions, together with the price increases they have fueled, have shown just how vulnerable such countries are. According to the FAO’s State of Food and Agriculture 2021 report, an additional 161 million people were affected by hunger in 2020, compared with 2019. And the World Food Program is now cautioning that the combination of conflict, COVID, the climate crisis, and rising costs has pushed 44 million people in 38 countries to the edge of famine. With countries struggling to secure enough food to meet their populations’ nutritional needs, many are now re-evaluating their food dependencies and seeking to expand local production. But unless sustainability is taken into account, efforts to increase short-term resilience by shortening supply chains could undermine medium- and long-term resilience by further depleting agricultural resources like soil and water. Sustainability isn’t cheap. Efficient production amid biophysical and climate constraints requires investment in costly technologies. But poor governance structures, limited growth prospects, and high debts pose major challenges for many countries. The pandemic has placed massive strain on public budgets, and debt crises loom for many governments, as loans taken out to address the pandemic come due. Poor and vulnerable countries cannot be expected to address the myriad interconnected challenges they face, from pollution and biodiversity loss to hunger and poverty, without help. To bolster long-term food and nutritional security, we must look beyond country-level solutions to regional and international ones that consider the needs of communities living in marginal environments. Otherwise, there will be no escaping destabilizing cycles of hunger, migration, and violence.",
            "全球饥饿危机就在这里 迪拜—全球粮食价格飞涨。 联合国粮食及农业组织的食品价格指数 — — 其涵盖一篮子基本食品（谷物、肉类、奶制品、植物油和糖 ） — —在 3 月份达到了 159.7 的历史新高，高于上个月的 141.1。 虽然 4 月份略降至 158.5，但持续的事态发展 — — 尤其是俄罗斯在乌克兰的战争 — — 将继续推高价格甚至创出新高，对全球饥饿造成毁灭性影响。 新冠大流行暴露出世界粮食系统的脆弱性和功能失调，而行动限制和供应链中断推高了价格，损害了农村生计，加剧了粮食不安全，穷人首当其冲。 现在，乌克兰战争加剧了这些挑战，因为战争双方都是食品、燃料和化肥的主要出口国。 此外，气候变化对全球粮食安全构成了更大威胁。 热浪、洪水和长期干旱等极端天气对农业生产和粮食供应造成了冲击。 随着气温升高，这些冲击将越来越频繁和剧烈。 如果全球变暖超过 1.5° 摄氏度的阈值（相对于地球工业化前 ） ， 冲击很可能会成为灾难性的。 正如最新的政府间气候变化专门委员会报告显示的那样，要避免看跨越这一阈值，需要立即采取严厉的行动。 但缓解只是挑战的一部分。 还需要在适应方面进行大规模投资，以保护弱势社区免受其已陷入其中的变暖的影响。 即使在最乐观的缓解情景下，全球变暖预计将在十年内达到 1.5°C 的阈值，然后回落。 这将导致气候带变化、海平面上升和水循环中断，从而增加极端天气的频率和强度。 除了增加经济和健康风险之外，由此造成的粮食和水供应的中断可能引发社会和政治动荡，助长贫困、饥饿、不稳定甚至冲突的恶性循环，同时移民急剧增加。 任何气候减缓或适应议程都必须有一个更具韧性、更可持续和更加公平的粮食系统作为支柱。 但建设这样一个系统的障碍不容小觑，特别是对于土壤贫瘠、土地没有农业价值、水等其他自然资源有限或退化、社会经济条件困难的国家和地区。 鉴于农业用地生产力低下，这类边缘环境无法支持可持续地生产足够粮食满足当地人民的营养需求。 事实上，虽然边缘环境只居住着不到25% 的全球人口（大约17 亿人 ） ， 但却占世界贫困人口 的70%和营养不良人口的大部分。 贫困和饥饿导致农民过度使用脆弱的环境资源以确保短期生存，即便这会耗尽土地的长期价值，让家庭和社区陷入贫困。 那些生活在基础设施不足、经济机会选择很少、市场准入有限的偏远地区的人，做出这样的选择的可能性最高。 因此边缘土地量巨大的国家依赖粮食进口 — — 在某些情况下，进口占其需求的 80% 以上。 但与大流行和战争相关的破坏，以及它们所助长的价格上涨，令这些国家不堪一击。 根据联合国粮农组织的《2021 年粮食及农业状况》报告，与 2019 年相比，2020 年受饥饿影响的人数增加了 1.61 亿。 世界粮食计划署现在警告说，冲突、新冠肺炎、气候危机和不断上升的成本已将 38 个国家的 4400 万人推向饥荒边缘。 各国竭尽全力获得足够的粮食满足人口的营养需求，许多国家现在正在重新评估粮食依赖情况，寻求扩大本地生产。 但除非将可持续性纳入考量，否则通过缩短供应链来提高短期韧性的做法可能会进一步消耗土壤和水等农业资源，破坏中长期韧性。 可持续性并不便宜。 生物物理和气候约束下的高效生产需要对昂贵的技术进行投资。 但糟糕的治理结构、有限的增长前景和高额债务对许多国家构成了重大挑战。 大流行给公共预算带来了巨大压力，随着为应对大流行发放的贷款到期，许多政府的债务危机近在眼前。 不能指望贫穷和弱势国家只靠自己解决其所面临的各种互相关联的挑战，不管是污染和生物多样性丧失，还是饥饿和贫困。 为了促进长期粮食和营养安全，我们必须超越国家级方案，依靠考虑边缘环境社区的区域和国际方案。 否则，我们绝不可能摆脱饥饿、移民和暴力的动荡循环。"

            "Our Responsibility to South Asia BRISBANE – Almost one-quarter of humanity lives on the Indian subcontinent. That fact is easily forgotten elsewhere, as world leaders focus on combating outbreaks of COVID-19 and its new variants within their own countries. But when our descendants pass judgment on this moment in history, they won’t remember just the lockdowns, face masks, and vaccination programs. They will also remember India and its neighbors. They will remember how human remains have been found bloated and decomposing on the banks of the sacred River Ganges; how bodies had to be left in the heat outside crematoria, owing to a lack of wood for funerary pyres. They will remember how hospitals ran low on oxygen, medication, and hospital beds, while people lined up outside emergency departments and clinics begging for someone to save their loved ones. All of this will be seared in memory and history. Beyond inflicting agony on the sick, the coronavirus outbreak in the world’s most populous democracy is now robbing victims of their dignity in death, too. At the Asia Society, we hear accounts almost daily from friends and colleagues who have lost their relatives. According to one member of our Asia 21 Young Leaders network, “An uncle passed away last evening. Another the day before. A friend’s father last week. Everyone I know has someone they’ve lost.” There are already too many of these stories, and now this tragedy is spilling across India’s borders. In Nepal, where one out of every two citizens is testing positive for the virus, the hardship is multiplied by the fact that India is the country’s principal supplier of vaccines and oxygen; that supply line is now shut down. While these up-close images reveal an unfolding humanitarian calamity, the 30,000-foot perspective shows that things will only worsen as this deadly wave expands unchecked to rural areas of the subcontinent, where essential medical facilities are even scarcer. As fellow members of the human family, and as citizens of democracies that stand up for each other when help is required, we all need to act – governments, businesses, and private citizens. The quicker we do so, the more lives we might save. Helping South Asia is not only the right thing to do; it is also in our own self-interest. The rampant spread of the virus anywhere can create more deadly variants that threaten all of us. So, what can be done? Start with vaccination: we need to put shots into at least a billion arms as fast as possible. To date, fewer than 10% of citizens in each South Asian country (with the exception of Bhutan) have received at least one vaccine dose, according to Our World in Data. We must pull new levers to speed things up. To that end, the rest of the world should join the United States and 100-plus other countries in backing a temporary World Trade Organization waiver of intellectual-property protections on vaccines. While not a silver bullet, this initiative, coupled with the removal of restrictions on related supplies and equipment, would help India’s sizable pharmaceutical industry to increase production, thereby reducing vaccine shortages domestically and in the region. It is also incumbent on countries with excess vaccine supplies – particularly those in the developed world – to share the wealth. Earlier in the pandemic, India set an example by sending more than 66 million doses of vaccines to 95 countries around the world when it could have vaccinated its own people more rapidly. It is time to return the favor. Equally important, more must be done to counter the scourge of misinformation. In an environment where fraudulent miracle cures are being propagated widely on social media, the world should help fund and support vaccine-literacy programs. Campaigns to increase the acceptance of masks, vaccines, social distancing, and other measures are needed especially in rural parts of the subcontinent, where complex sociocultural factors and linguistic diversity pose additional challenges. Finally, there is the problem of insufficient oxygen – canisters, concentrators, and tankers to transport them. Of all the requests we have heard from our friends in the region, the plea for more oxygen has been the most urgent. India has only around 1,600 cryogenic tankers capable of transporting oxygen from production facilities to hospitals. And that includes the tankers it already supplied to Nepal, which itself has such a paucity of oxygen canisters that it is now asking mountaineers returning from Mount Everest to donate their empty ones. Shipping cryogenic tankers and oxygen canisters to South Asia will help save the lives of those threatened by the shortage, rather than by COVID-19 itself. Here, developed countries with ample production capacity can help in ways that local nongovernmental organizations cannot – and help they must. Ultimately, this pandemic, and the legacy of our global response, belongs to all of us. Each generation is confronted by challenges great and small, and this one is ours. Unless we can truly protect people everywhere by arresting the virus and slowing its mutations, we may find ourselves facing the prospect of a permanent pandemic.",
            "我们对南亚的责任 布里斯班—几乎四分之一的人类生活在印度次大陆。 这一事实在其他地方很容易被遗忘，因为世界各国领导人专注于对抗新冠的爆发及其在本国境内的新变种。 但是，当我们的后代对历史的这一刻做出判断时，他们不会只记得封锁、口罩和疫苗接种计划。 他们也会记得印度及其邻国。 他们会记得如何发现神圣的恒河河畔膨胀和分解的人类遗骸；记得由于火葬用木料不足，尸体不得不留在火葬场外的高温中。 他们会记得医院氧气、药品和病床不足，而人们在急诊室和诊所外排队乞求有人来救他们的亲人。 所有这一切都将烙印在记忆和历史中。 除了给病人带来痛苦之外，世界上人口最多的民主国家爆发的新冠疫情现在也在剥夺受害者的死亡尊严。 在亚洲学会，我们几乎每天都听说有朋友和同事失去亲人的朋友。 我们的一位亚洲21位青年领袖（Asia 21 Young Leaders）网络成员说 ， “ 昨天晚上一位叔叔去世了。 前一天也有一位叔叔去世。 上周一个朋友的父亲去世了。 我认识的每个人都失去了亲人 。 ” 这些故事已经太多了，而现在这场悲剧正蔓延到印度的边界。 在尼泊尔，每两名公民中就有一人病毒 检测呈阳性 ，而印度是该国疫苗和氧气的主要供应国，这条供应线现已关闭，这使尼泊尔困难倍增。 虽然这些近距离图像揭示了正在发生的人道主义灾难，但30000英尺外的视角表明，随着这一致命浪潮不受约束地扩展到次大陆的农村地区，情况只会恶化，因为那里的基本医疗设施甚至更加匮乏。 作为人类大家庭的同僚，作为在需要帮助时相互支持的民主国家的公民，我们所有人都必须行动起来 — — 政府、企业和公民个人。 我们行动得越快，所能挽救的生命就越多。 帮助南亚不仅是正确的事，这也符合我们自身的利益。 病毒在任何地方猖獗传播都可能会产生更致命的变种，威胁我们所有人。 那么，能做些什么呢？ 从接种开始：我们需要尽快向至少10亿只手臂注射疫苗。 据《数据看世界 》 （ Our World in Data）报道，迄今为止，每个南亚国家（不丹除外）只有不到10%的公民至少接种了一剂疫苗。 我们必须利用心手段来加快速度。 为此，世界其他国家应与美国和 100多个国家 一道，支持世界贸易组织暂时 放弃 疫苗知识产权保护。 这一举措虽然不是一颗灵丹妙药，但再加上取消对相关供应和设备的限制的话，将有助于印度庞大的制药业增加产量，从而减少国内和区域内的疫苗短缺。 疫苗供应过剩的国家 — — 尤其是发达国家 — — 也有分享的责任。 在疫情早期，印度向全世界95个国家发送了 6600多万剂 疫苗，为我们树立了榜样。 当时的印度本可以更快地为本国人民接种疫苗。 现在是报恩的时候了。 同样重要的是，必须做更多的工作来对付错误信息的祸害。 在欺诈性奇迹疗法在社交媒体上泛滥的情况下，世界应该资助和支持疫苗扫盲计划。 需要开展运动增加对口罩、疫苗、保持社交距离和其他措施的接受程度，特别是在印度次大陆的农村地区，那里复杂的社会文化因素和语言多样性带来了额外的挑战。 最后还有氧气不足的问题 — — 氧气罐、浓缩器和运输它们的轮船。 在我们从该地区朋友那里听到的所有请求中，增加氧气的呼声是最紧迫的。 印度只有大约1600艘冷藏船，能够将氧气从生产设施输送到医院。 这其中包括印度已经提供给尼泊尔的冷藏船。 尼泊尔本身氧气罐也非常缺乏，现在甚至已要求从珠穆朗玛峰返回的登山者捐出空氧气罐。 运向南亚的冷藏船和氧气罐将有助于挽救那些受到短缺，而不是新冠本身威胁的人的生命。 在这里，生产能力充足的发达国家可以以当地非政府组织无法提供的方式提供帮助 — — 也必须提供帮助。 归根结底，这场疫情，以及我们全球反应的遗产，属于我们所有人。 每一代人都面临着大大小小的挑战，新冠便是我们面临的挑战。 除非我们能够通过捕获病毒和减缓突变来真正保护世界各地的人们，否则我们可能发现自己面临着一场永久的温疫。"

            "Support Ahmad Massoud and the Afghan Resistance PANJSHIR, AFGHANISTAN – While the international community abandons Afghanistan, veteran warriors in the struggles against the Soviet Union and the Taliban are gathering in their old base camps deep in north-central Afghanistan’s Panjshir Valley. Although some of the towns of Panjshir have fallen to the Taliban, a National Resistance Front, similar to the one that fought the Soviets and helped the United States overthrow the Taliban in 2001, has begun to mount a resistance campaign. Their cause is both just and necessary, as a dizzying array of terrorist organizations are also gathering in other parts of the country. This is a clear and present danger for the entire world, because Afghanistan’s mountains and valleys have previously spawned and incubated jihadist movements that spread from Algeria to Libya, through Syria and Saudi Arabia. Re-establishment of Taliban rule is already inspiring many such groups. Al-Qaeda’s partners in the Syrian city of Idlib are rejoicing openly, and Hamas is celebrating. The Taliban’s return to power has provided violent Islamist groups not only a potent moral victory, but also, and more worryingly, a potential safe haven. Already, one of al-Qaeda founder Osama bin Laden’s closest aides has returned triumphantly to Afghanistan. To prevent the re-emergence of the world’s most lethal terrorist organization and its offshoots, the entire international community – particularly China and India – need to work with local partners. Only by doing so will the Taliban feel sufficient pressure to sever ties with its pariah associates. Although the Taliban ruled most of Afghanistan from 1996-2001, they never completely eliminated resistance to their rule. In the rugged and narrow Panjshir Valley, the Northern Alliance, led by Ahmad Shah Massoud, held sway. Massoud warned as early as the mid-1980s that the foreign fighters who were migrating to Afghanistan had a more sinister agenda than driving out the Soviets. Two days before the attacks of September 11, 2001, Massoud was assassinated in a suicide bombing carried out by al-Qaeda operatives contracted by the Taliban. Today, malign forces are targeting Massoud’s ancestral home in the Panjshir Valley, where his son, Ahmad, is organizing the resistance to Taliban rule. I have known the younger Massoud for more than a decade, watching him mature from a cautious and shy figure into a leader who commands the respect of his fighters and the valley’s civilian population. He began his career working on humanitarian projects in Panjshir as the head of the Massoud Foundation, rather than joining the Afghan government. He never viewed the country as a personal piggybank, as did countless government leaders and mid-level bureaucrats. Instead, Massoud advocated for accountability and equity. And unlike many other Afghan leaders, who held such concepts in contempt and bought homes in the United Arab Emirates and Spain, Massoud spent the last four years living in Panjshir and forging a strong base. Massoud’s desire to stay and fight is lost on other Afghan leaders. Unlike warlords such as Abdul Rashid Dostum and Atta Muhammad Nur, Massoud held firm as the Taliban surged into power. He rebuffed offers from two heads of state to whisk him to safety on private planes. In doing so, he is following the example of his father, who never abandoned his homeland even as he faced the Taliban juggernaut. I spent the harrowing days of Afghanistan’s fall with him. For three weeks, we watched as province after province capitulated to the Taliban and panic gripped the country. But, despite the chaos and uncertainty, Massoud insists the government’s collapse will not lead to his own surrender. Massoud is no stranger to the international community. He studied at the United Kingdom’s prestigious Sandhurst Royal Military Academy and later at King’s College London. When his maternal grandfather asked him why he chose to major in war studies when Afghanistan could provide him a battlefield view, the young Massoud replied that he focused on the subject so his generation could avoid war rather than remaining mired in it. As Massoud matured, his stature grew, earning him meetings with heads of states and intelligence chiefs around the world. Today, facing a Taliban onslaught, he needs material assistance, not petit fours in presidential palaces. The billions of dollars of American weaponry the Taliban swept up in their march on Kabul has made its way to the valley, and Massoud lacks the supply routes through Tajikistan that his father relied on to repel the Taliban. But the valley’s craggy and steep gorges provide him benefits no war strategist can deny. And the ranks of his fighters are growing daily as former Afghan security officials flock to Panjshir, unwilling to accept the Taliban takeover. There have been widespread protests in Kabul and overseas in support of Massoud’s call for resistance. To protect his enclave, Massoud’s forces need long-range mortars to repel the Taliban’s heavy guns. Communication equipment also is vital in a region where the Taliban periodically severs mobile and internet links. And the civilians in his fledgling rebel redoubt need winterization kits as the temperatures begin to fall. Without such aid, this last bastion of Taliban resistance will be wiped out. Ever since the Taliban took Kabul, the international community has insisted that it will neither accept the reimposition of the group’s rigid Islamic strictures nor acquiesce as Afghanistan becomes a jihadist safe haven. By supporting Massoud, the international community can back up its words with action. Otherwise, it is likely the Taliban will brush off international pressure and re-establish an Islamic Emirate, offering protection to all like-minded groups, however murderous their agenda. That is a proposition the world cannot afford.",
            "支持小马苏德和阿富汗抵抗力量 发自潘杰希尔—当国际社会弃阿富汗于不顾之时，当年那些参加过反对苏联和塔利班斗争的老战士们正在阿富汗中北部潘杰希尔山谷深处的老营地里集结。 尽管潘杰希尔的一些城镇已经落入塔利班之手，但一个类似反苏作战并在2001年协助美国推翻塔利班的全国抵抗阵线已经发起了一场抵抗运动。 他们的事业既正义，也是必要的，因为一堆五花八门的恐怖组织也正在该国其他地区聚集。 这对整个世界来说是个明确且现实的危险，因为阿富汗的高山深谷曾催生和孕育过各类圣战运动 — — 从阿尔及利亚蔓延到利比亚，途经叙利亚和沙特阿拉伯。 塔利班统治的重新确立让许多这类组织激动不已。 基地组织在叙利亚伊德利卜的伙伴组织公开欢呼，哈马斯也在大肆庆祝。 塔利班的重新掌权不仅为伊斯兰暴力组织一个强有力的精神胜利，更令人担忧的是还提供了一个潜在的避风港，就连基地组织创始人奥萨马·本·拉登其中一个最亲密的副手也已经大摇大摆地回到了阿富汗。 为了防止这个全球最致命恐怖组织及其分支死灰复燃，整个国际社会 — — 尤其是中国和印度 — — 需要与当地伙伴展开合作。 惟其如此，塔利班才会感受到足够压力去切断与那些被世人唾弃的伙伴组织之间的联系。 尽管塔利班在1996~2001年间统治了阿富汗大部分地区，但他们从未彻底消灭对其政权的反抗。 在蜿蜒崎岖的潘杰希尔山谷，由艾哈迈德·沙赫·马苏德（Ahmad Shah Massoud）领导的北方联盟占据了主导地位。 马苏德早在1980年代中期就警告说那些进驻阿富汗的外国战斗人员有着比赶走苏联人更邪恶的目的，最终在2001年“9·11”袭击事件发生的前两天他死于由塔利班雇佣的基地组织人员实施的自杀式爆炸。 如今这些邪恶势力瞄准了马苏德家族世代居住的潘杰希尔山谷，而他的儿子小马苏德（Ahmad Massoud）则在那里组织对塔利班统治的抵抗。 我认识小马苏德已经十多年了，看着他从一个敏感害羞的男子成长为一个深得部下和谷地民众爱戴的领导人。 他没有加入阿富汗政府，而是作为马苏德基金会的负责人服务于潘杰希尔地区的人道主义项目。 他从未像无数阿富汗政府领导人和中层官僚那样将国家视为自家的提款机，而是倡导问责和公平。 而且与其他许多对这些理念不屑一顾却忙于在阿联酋和西班牙置办房产的阿富汗领导人不同，马苏德在过去四年间一直生活在潘杰希尔，还建立了一个强大的基地。 马苏德留下来战斗的意愿是其他阿富汗领导人所不具备的。 与阿卜杜勒·拉希德·杜斯塔姆（Abdul Rashid Dostum）和阿塔·穆罕默德·努尔（Atta Muhammad Nur）这些军阀不同，马苏德在塔利班势力猛增时一直坚守岗位，还回绝了两位国家元首用私人飞机把他送到安全地带的提议。 他矢志追随着自己的父亲 — — 即便在塔利班大军压境时也从未放弃过自己的祖国的老马苏德。 我和他一起度过了阿富汗沦陷的那段痛苦时光。 在三个星期内我们看着一个又一个省份向塔利班投降，恐慌笼罩着整个国家。 但尽管存在混乱和不确定性，马苏德依然拒绝因为政府垮台而投降。 马苏德对国际社会并不陌生。 他早年在英国著名的桑德赫斯特皇家军事学院学习，随后就读于伦敦国王学院。 当他的外祖父问他阿富汗已是一片战乱景象，为什么还要选择主修战争研究的时候，年轻的马苏德回答说他专注于此是为了让自己这一代人免于战争而不致继续深陷其中。 随着马苏德日渐成熟，他的地位也不断提高，使之有机会与世界各国元首和情报主管共商国是。 如今面对塔利班的进攻，他需要的是物质援助，而不是总统官邸里的精致下午茶。 塔利班在进军喀布尔时沿路收缴的数十亿美元美式武器装备已经运到了山谷，而小马苏德虽然缺乏他父亲赖以击退塔利班的塔吉克斯坦补给线，但山谷中的峭壁也为他提供了任何战争战略家都无法否认的好处。 随着不愿意接受塔利班接管的前阿富汗安全官员涌向潘杰希尔，他的队伍每天都在壮大。 在喀布尔和世界各地也都出现了响应马苏德抵抗号召的广泛抗议活动。 为了保护这个孤岛，马苏德的部队需要远程迫击炮来击退塔利班的重武器。 在塔利班定期切断移动信号和互联网的地区，通信设备也至关重要。 随着气温逐步下降，生活在他新构建的抵抗区里的民众需要过冬物资。 如果没有这些援助，这个反塔利班力量的最后壁垒终将难逃被攻破的命运。 自从塔利班占领喀布尔以来，国际社会一直坚称既不会接受该组织重新实施僵化的伊斯兰教戒律，也不会坐视阿富汗成为圣战分子的避风港。 而通过给小马苏德予支持，国际社会可以将自身言论化为行动。 否则塔利班很可能会无视国际压力，重新建立一个伊斯兰酋长国并窝藏所有跟它们臭味相投的组织 — — 无论后者的议程是多么惨无人道。 而这么一个后果可是我们这个世界所无法承受的。"

            "The World Needs a Breakthrough Year LONDON – This year must mark a global turning point. Whereas international cooperation often failed in 2020, we now have an opportunity – and the responsibility – to usher in a new era in which a healthier, greener, safer, and fairer world is possible. The great truth that has emerged from the coronavirus pandemic is that no one, anywhere, is safe from COVID-19 until everyone, everywhere, is safe. The first step, which will pay for itself many times over, is to ensure mass vaccination in every affected country. Support from the G7 and G20 that will make vaccines readily accessible to low- and middle-income countries is not an act of charity; it is in every country’s strategic interest. Indeed, the International Monetary Fund believes that such support would be the best public investment ever made. At the G7 summit this week in Cornwall, member states and their invitees should lead the way by guaranteeing to pay 67% of required funding for the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator this year and next. This is based on a fair-share financing approach and a financial burden-sharing formula proposed by the governments of Norway and South Africa, and reflects a realistic assessment of countries’ ability to pay. The G7 should also lead the way in support of dose sharing and voluntary licensing agreements, potentially including temporary patent waivers that would allow the knowledge and technology transfer needed to manufacture vaccines on every continent. Moreover, the world’s multilateral and regional financial institutions should be asked to release new resources for low- and middle-income countries to strengthen their health systems’ capacity. And they should also support implementation of the detailed recommendations of the recent report to the World Health Organization by the Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response. Global economic policy alignment will be crucial in rebuilding the world economy in the pandemic’s wake. We were fortunate that, over the past year, in the initial COVID-19 recovery phase, most countries followed similar policies, resulting in an acceptable level of alignment. What we need now is an agreed global growth plan with coordinated monetary and fiscal interventions to prevent an uneven and unbalanced recovery – and ensure a more inclusive, equitable, and greener future. For example, the IMF’s proposals for a synchronized push on infrastructure, including green infrastructure, across all continents would, if adopted by the G7 and G20, raise global economic output by a projected $2 trillion by 2025. The G20 and G7 must also address the growing divergence caused by differences in health outcomes and uncoordinated macroeconomic policy approaches. While most advanced economies can look forward to strong growth and widely available vaccines, much of the emerging and developing world must face the new waves and new variants of the virus with depleted economic and social buffers. Following a slow recovery in global trade and foreign direct investment, many countries face rising debt and falling tax revenues, as well as declining aid flows. With up to 150 million more people forced into poverty by COVID-19, and with widespread cuts in health-care and education budgets, the pandemic may have delayed progress toward the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by up to five years, with girls and women suffering most. We call on the G7 to extend their initiative on girls’ education and to support the UNICEF plan for digital connectivity that ensures the inclusion of all young people. The G7 and G20 can help to bridge the financing gaps faced by vulnerable countries and act to restore a viable path toward the SDGs. This will require the multilateral development banks to deploy more finance, more efficiently, optimizing their balance sheets and reviewing their capital adequacy framework, as already requested by the G20, and consider replenishments. In this respect, we need to examine new guarantee-based instruments to crowd in private-sector finance for health, education, and social safety nets, and we need to make progress on international agreements to curtail tax avoidance such as the global minimum rate recently backed by G7 finance ministers. In addition, we must redouble our efforts to ensure debt sustainability for low- and middle-income countries. That means extending the G20’s Debt Service Suspension Initiative and encouraging broader participation by private creditors, and possibly by non-G20 official creditors, in the new Common Framework for Debt Treatments. Success will depend on greater transparency on the part of both debtors and creditors. This year is also vital for progress toward reaching net-zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2050. In advance of the United Nations climate summit (COP26) in Glasgow this November, the G7 and G20 countries must announce bold national commitments. They must require companies to disclose their carbon footprints, deliver on the proposed fund for mitigation and adaptation in low- and lower-middle-income countries, and ensure that their economic recovery plans boost renewables and green infrastructure. This is not a task for national governments alone. Firms, cities, and multilateral institutions all must be at the center of efforts to achieve net-zero emissions by mid-century. And, as with the post-pandemic global recovery, the coordinated efforts we need must be set firmly in place this year.

            "世界需要突破性的一年 伦敦—今年必须成为全球转折点。 尽管国际合作在2020年常常失效，但我们现在有机会 — — 也有责任 — — 迎来一个可能打造出更健康、更绿色、更安全也更公平的世界的崭新时代。 冠状病毒疫情所展现出来的一个重大事实是，除非所有角落的所有人都能在新冠病毒面前得到保护，否则，任何地方的任何人都不安全。 首要步骤是，确保所有感染国都进行大规模疫苗接种，这样做带来的效益将是成本的许多倍。 七国和二十国集团的支持将使中低收入国家能随时获得疫苗，而且这绝对不是一种慈善行为；这符合所有国家的战略利益。 事实上，国际货币基金组织认为，这种支持可能是有史以来效益最佳的公共投资。 本周将在康沃尔召开的七国峰会上，各成员国及其邀请国应带头确保，在今明两年，为使用2019年新冠病毒工具加速器（ACT）服务提供67%的所需资金。 上述目标来源于由挪威和南非政府所提出的公平分担筹资办法和财政分摊公式。 该公式现实评估了各国的支付能力。 七国集团还应带头支持疫苗分享和自愿许可协议，其中可能包括临时性专利豁免，从而允许疫苗生产所需的知识和技术在所有大陆上传递。 此外，国际社会应要求世界多边和地区金融机构为中低收入国家提供全新资源，目的是强化其医疗系统能力。 它们还应支持落实疫情筹备和应对独立小组最近提交给世卫组织报告中所载明的详细建议。 全球经济政策对疫情流行后重建世界经济极为关键。 幸运的是，过去一年来，在最初的2019年新冠病毒复苏阶段，多数国家都推行了类似政策，并达到了一种可以接受的合作水平。 我们现在需要协商一致的全球增长计划，其中包括协调一致的货币和财政干预政策，目的是防止出现复苏不平衡 — — 同时确保建设一个更包容、更平等也更绿色的未来。 例如，国际货币基金组织提议同步推进包括绿色基础设施在内的各大洲基础设施建设，如果得到七国和20国集团的首肯，那么，截止2025年，预计将使全球经济产出提高2万亿美元。 二十国和七国集团还必须解决医疗效果差异及宏观经济政策方法不协调所导致的日益严重的分歧。 虽然绝大多数发达经济体可以期待强劲经济增长和疫苗广泛使用，但多数新兴和发展中国家则必须面对新一波病毒变种，同时这些国家的经济和社会缓冲资源已经耗尽。 在全球贸易和外国直接投资缓慢复苏后，许多国家将面临债务上升、税收下降以及援助资源下降等问题。 由于2019年新冠病毒导致又有1.5亿人陷入贫困，以及各国普遍削减医疗和教育预算，此次疫情或许已经将实现2030年可持续发展目标的时间表推迟了5年，其中尤以妇女和女童受害最深。 我们呼吁七国集团扩大其女童教育计划，并支持联合国儿童基金会的数字连接计划，以确保涵盖所有年轻人。 七国和二十国集团可以协助弥补脆弱国家所面临的融资缺口，同时采取行动，重新打通通往可持续发展目标的可行途径。 这将要求多边开发银行按照20国集团的规定更有效地部署更多资金，同时优化其资产负债表并审查资本充足率框架，同时考虑补充资金。 在这方面，我们需要研究能为医疗、教育和社会安全网引入私人资本的新的以担保为基础的融资工具，我们还需要在国际协调方面取得进展，目的是减少避税，如推动实行由七国集团财长支持的全球最低税率。 此外，我们必须加倍努力，确保中低收入国家债务的可持续性。 这意味着延长20国集团的暂停偿债协议，鼓励私人债主、可能还包括非20国集团官方债主大规模参与到新的债务处理共同框架之中。 债权人和债务人能否提高透明度决定了相关努力能否成功。 今年对能否在2050年前实现二氧化碳零净排放也发挥着至关重要的作用。 在今年11月格拉斯哥联合国气候峰会（COP26）召开之前，七国和二十国集团国家必须宣布大胆的国家承诺。 它们必须要求企业披露其碳足迹，落实仍处在讨论阶段的中低收入国家缓解和适应基金，并同时确保这些国家的经济复苏计划推动可再生能源和绿色基础设施。 这不仅仅是各国政府的任务。 企业、城市和多边机构都必须成为到本世纪中叶实现零净排放目标的核心推手。 而且，与疫情过后的全球复苏一样，我们今年必须奠定所需要的协调努力的基础。 本评论署名作者包括: María Elena Agüero —马德里俱乐部秘书长；Bertie Ahern Taoiseach，爱尔兰共和国 (1997-2008 ) ; Philippe Aghion —法兰西学院和伦敦经济学院经济学教授; Shamshad Akhtar —巴基斯坦国家银行第14任行长，世界银行负责中东和北非事务的前副行长及GWL Voices成员; Farida Allaghi —前利比亚驻欧盟大使; Amat Alsoswa —也门首位女大使兼部长，GWL Voices成员、前助理秘书长、助理署长兼联合国开发计划署阿拉伯国家区域局局长；Abdulaziz Altwaijri —伊斯兰国家教科文组织前总干事; Rosalia Arteaga —1997年厄瓜多尔总统; Shaukat Aziz —巴基斯坦总理(2004-07 ) ; Jean Badershneider —2000-13埃克森美孚副总裁兼首席执行官，全球废除现代奴隶制基金会创始董事; Jan Peter Balkenende —荷兰总理 (2002-10 ) ; Joyce Banda —马拉维总统(2012-14 ) ; Ajay Banga —万事达执行主席; Kaushik Basu —国际经济协会主席兼世界银行首席经济学家(2012-16 ) ; Oliver Bäte —安联集团首席执行官; Marek Belka — 波兰总理（2004-05）及 波兰国家银行行长（2010-16 ） ; Carol Bellamy —国际终止童妓组织主席，全球社区参与和复苏基金（GCERF）前董事主席，和平队前主席，联合国儿童基金会执行主任，世界学会总裁兼首席执行官； Erik Berglof —欧洲复兴开发银行首席经济学家 (2006-15 ) , 伦敦经济学院经济学教授; Sali Berisha —阿尔巴尼亚总统1992-97,总理2005-13; Catherine Bertini — 联合国世界粮食计划署前执行主任兼联合国管理事务副秘书长; Suman Bery —荷兰皇家壳牌公司首席经济学家(2012-16 ) , 新德里国家应用经济研究理事会总干事; 沙特亲王Turki bin Faisal —费萨尔国王基金会研究和伊斯兰研究中心主席; Ana Birchall —罗马尼亚副总理2016-19; Valdis Birkavs —拉脱维亚总理(1993-94 ) ; Mario Blejer — 阿根廷央行行长 (2002 ) ; 英格兰银行中央银行研究中心主任 (2003-08 ) ; Irina Bokova —联合国教科文组织前总干事; Patrick Bolton —伦敦帝国理工学院金融与经济学教授;哥伦比亚大学教授; Dumitru Bragish —摩尔多瓦总理1999-2001; Richard Branson —B团队联合创始人兼维珍集团创始人; Mayu Brizuela de Avila —萨尔瓦多前外长; Jesper Brodin —英嘉集团（宜家）首席执行官(IKEA ) ; Gro Brundtland —挪威前总理; John Bruton —爱尔兰前总理; Robin Burgess —伦敦经济学院经济学教授; Sharon Burrow —B团队副主席兼国际工会联合会秘书长; Micheline Calmy-Rey —瑞士前总统; Kathy Calvin —联合国基金会前主席兼首席执行官; Kathy Calvin —联合国基金会董事; Fernando Henrique Cardoso —巴西总统(1995-2003 ) ; Wendy Carlin —伦敦大学学院经济学教授; Hikmet Cetin —土耳其外长1991-94; Lynda Chalker —英国前海外发展部部长; Laura Chinchilla —哥斯达黎加总统 (2010-14 ) , 马德里俱乐部副主席; Bai Chong-En —清华大学清华经济管理学院院长; Helen Clark —新西兰总理 (1999-2008 ) ; Joe Clark — 加拿大前总理; Marie-Louise Coleiro-Preca —马尔他总统(2014-19 ) ; Emil Constantinescu —罗马尼亚总统 (1996-2000 ) ; Diane Coyle CBE —剑桥大学班尼特公共政策研究所联合所长; Chester Crocker —前美国助理国务卿; Mirko Cvetkovic —塞尔维亚总理(2008-12 ) ; Marzuki Darusman —印尼前司法部长; Herman De Croo —国务部长，比利时众议院名誉议长; Nathalie de Gaulle — SOCIETER创始人兼合伙人; FW de Klerk —南非前总统; Dominique de Villepin —法国前总理(2005-07 ) ; Kemal Derviş —土耳其经济事务部长 (2001-02 ) , 联合国开发计划署署长(2005-09 ) ; 布鲁金斯学会全球经济与发展高级研究员; Mathias Dewatripont —布鲁塞尔自由大学经济学教授; Beatrice Weder di Mauro —经济政策研究中心(CEPR)主席兼日内瓦研究生院国际经济学教授; Božidar Djelić —塞尔维亚副总理(2007-11 ) ; Mark Dybul —前美国全球艾滋病协调员(2006-09) 及全球抗击艾滋病、结核病和疟疾基金执行主任(2012-17 ) ; Victor J.

            "A Tipping Point Missed WASHINGTON, DC – Before America and the world settle in firmly to the new Donald Trump-based reality, let’s take a little trip down the road not taken. Suppose we had woken up last Wednesday morning to a President-elect Hillary Clinton. And let’s say that, instead of former Portuguese Prime Minister António Guterres, New Zealand’s Helen Clark or Bulgaria’s Kristalina Georgieva had been picked to succeed Ban Ki-moon as United Nations Secretary-General. Clinton would have joined the United Kingdom’s Theresa May and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, helping achieve critical mass in the G7. And a female UN Secretary-General would have placed women at the helm of two of the world’s three biggest international organizations (France’s Christine Lagarde already runs the International Monetary Fund). With so many female leaders, we would have begun to answer the question: what happens when women run the world? Would the world be better for women? Would it even be different? According to sociologists, female leaders are of two schools: Queen Bees, who are less likely to help other women advance, and Righteous Women, who make the advancement of other women a priority. Most early pioneers, such as the UK’s Margaret Thatcher, India’s Indira Gandhi, and Israel’s Golda Meir, were Queen Bees; all of them eschewed feminism. More recently, Righteous Women have prevailed. Leaders like Argentina’s Cristina Kirchner, Brazil’s Dilma Rousseff, and Iceland’s Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir have all sought, in one way or another, to empower women and help them advance in their countries. Merkel and May have tended to be more like Queen Bees, while Clinton, Lagarde, Clark, and Georgieva are more like Righteous Women. To be fair, the first woman leader in a male-dominated culture must often outman the men. Seeking to advance other women can highlight her own womanhood and thereby weaken her. Clinton, for example, was the third woman US Secretary of State but the first who felt secure enough to be able to champion the cause of women and girls worldwide. As President, she pledged, half her cabinet would be women, and she would further the State Department initiatives launched during her tenure. Yes, she also would have been careful to avoid being defined as a woman president. Still, just the presence of a plurality of women has an impact. For example, studies of US courts with multiple judges show that male judges are more willing to hear bias cases when one woman is on the bench, and significantly more willing when a second woman is added. “Each of us,” noted Sandra Day O’Connor, the first female member of the US Supreme Court, who was renowned for not wanting to be perceived as a “female” justice, “brings to our job, whatever it is, our lifetime of experience and our values.” In other words, women bring a fresh perspective, heard clearly only when a critical mass of them is present in any institution. Consider a woman’s perspective on conflict. Evidence does not support the stereotype that women are more pacifist than men – the peacemakers and settlers of male disputes. Women can be Amazons; recall Thatcher’s prosecution of the Falklands War and her admonition to George H.W. Bush not to “go wobbly” in the run-up to the first Gulf War. On the other hand, when men see wars, they naturally imagine the world of the warriors, whereas women see themselves in the women who must try to shelter their families from forces they cannot control. That is precisely the diversity of perspective that is vital to decision-making. And indeed, the Institute for Inclusive Security at Harvard’s Kennedy School has tracked the differences women make as part of peace negotiations. An acute awareness of the magnitude of civilian suffering in conflicts such as the Syrian civil war or the ongoing horrors in the Congo Basin, and an appreciation of how cycles of violence perpetuate themselves over generations, can actually make women much more likely to urge the use of force in interventions. Former US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright famously chided Colin Powell for his reluctance to involve the US military in the Balkans in the 1990s, in part because of her own family’s experience as Czech refugees from Communism. Overall, a woman leader’s decisions are no more predictable than a male leader’s. Women are not monolithic: they have various ideological backgrounds and diverse governing styles. But when the world finally reaches the point when women are not a rarity at the tables of power, when their numbers reach a tipping point, their voices will be heard differently, and their opinions will hold more weight with the men around them. Women came closer in 2016 than in any other era to reaching that tipping point. But we may still have to wait decades to find out what will happen when we finally do.",
            "错失的临界点 华盛顿—在美国和世界踏实既受新的基于特朗普的现实之前，让我们来窥探一番美国人民没有选择的那条路。 假设我们上周三醒来，发现克林顿当选了美国总统。 并且，不是葡萄牙前总理古特雷斯，而是新西兰的海伦·克拉克（Helen Clark）或保加利亚的克里斯塔利娜·乔治艾娃（Kristalina Georgieva）被遴选为联合国秘书长潘基文的继任者。 克林顿将和英国的梅和德国的默克尔一起，在G7形成临界规模。 而女联合国秘书长将让女性拥有世界三大国际组织中两个的最高职位。 在拥有如此多女性领导人的情况下，我们将开始问一个问题：当女性统治世界时，会发生什么？ 世界会变得对女性更加友好吗？ 它会有所不同吗？ 按照社会学家的分类，女性领导人可以归为两类：蜂后型，不太可能帮助其他女性晋升；以及正义女神型，将把其他女性的晋升列为重点。 大部分早期先驱，如英国的撒切尔夫人、印度的英迪拉·甘地和以色列的梅厄夫人，都属于蜂后型；她们都回避女权主义。 最近，正义女神型开始得势。 阿根廷的克里斯蒂娜·基什内尔、巴西的罗塞夫、冰岛的西于尔扎多蒂（Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir）以各种各样的方式为女性赋权并帮助她们在各自国家提高地位。 默克尔和梅以往更倾向于是蜂后型，而克林顿、拉加德、克拉克和乔治艾娃更像是正义女神型。 公平地说，在男性主导的世界中的第一位女性领导人往往必须比男人还男人。 寻求提升其他女性地位可能突出她自身的女人性质，从而削弱她。 比如，克林顿是第三位美国女国务卿，但她是第一位感觉自己地位足够安全，能够引领全球妇女和女孩运动的女国务卿。 作为总统，她承诺内阁中将有一半是女性，并将进一步推进她在国务院任内退出的措施。 是的，她也将小心翼翼避免被定义为女总统。 但是，仅仅是出现了大量女性面���就能产生影响。 比如，对有多名法官的美国法庭的研究表明，男法官更愿意在有女法官在场的情况下听取偏见案例，而如果有第二位女法官加入，他的意愿会大大增加。 “我们每个人 ， ” 因为不愿意被认为是“女性”正义的化身而闻名的美国最高法院第一位女法官桑德拉·奥康纳（Sandra Day O’Connor）指出 ， “ 都会在职业生涯中带上我们的生活经验和我们的价值观，不管这些东西是什么 。 ” 换句话说，女性带来了新鲜视角，只有当她们在某一机构中达到临界规模时才能被听到。 考虑一个女性对冲突的视角。 证据并不支持女性比男性更爱和平的刻板印象 — — 男性纠纷的和平缔造者和“和事佬 ” 。 女性可以是亚马逊战士；想想撒切尔夫人发动的马岛战争和她在第一次海湾战争前夕对老布什不要“摇摆”的劝诫。 另一方面，男性在看待战争时会自然想象出一个战士的世界，而女性常常把自己看成必须保护家庭不受她们无法控制的力量摧残的女人。 正是这种视角上的多元化对于决策来说至关重要。 事实上，哈佛大学肯尼迪学院的包容性安全研究所（Institute for Inclusive Security）跟踪观察了女性参与和平谈判时所造成的不同。 敏锐地认识到平民在叙利亚内战和刚果盆地的持续恐怖事件等冲突中可能受到的苦难，以及理解冤冤相报如何在代际间传递确实可能让女性更加可能采取武力干预。 前美国国务卿奥尔布赖特（Madeleine Albright）对科林·鲍威尔（Colin Powell）提出过著名的批评，指责他在20世纪90年代不肯让美军介入巴尔干冲突，这部分是因为她身为捷克共产主义难民的亲身家庭经验。 总体而言，女性领导人的决定比男性领导人更加容易预测。 女性不顽固：她们有不同的思想背景和多元化的执政风格。 但当女性终于不再是权力桌上的稀客时，当女性数量达到临界点时，她们的声音将有所不同，她们的观点将对周边男性具备更大分量的影响。 2016年，女性比以往任何时候都更加接近于这一临界点。 但我们也许仍然需要等待几十年才能了解当临界点终于达到时会发生什么。"

            "Homesick Politics MADRID – World order – or the lack thereof – is a hot topic these days. Our fixation with the future of global structures and systems is evident everywhere – in the news and at conferences, on bestseller lists, even in popular television shows. People are anxious. The world seems to be undergoing fundamental change: new actors are emerging on the world stage, previously sacrosanct rules of international behavior are being openly defied, and a new wave of technological progress is disrupting entire industries and economic sectors. In our quest for structure and predictability – a natural impulse in times of rapid change – we are desperate for hints about how the world, and our role in it, will develop. It is of course vital in such situations that we identify the best, or at least the most feasible, way forward; predictability provides a foundation for cost-benefit analysis and strategic thinking. The problem arises when our yearning for certainty overwhelms rational thinking, taking our ideas and actions in an unproductive – or even dangerous – direction. The current trend toward rose-colored retrospection is a case in point. Faced with political, economic, geostrategic, and social uncertainty, policymakers have increasingly succumbed to the allure of nostalgia, promising a return to what they portray as the familiar and complete rules and practices of the past. In Russia, President Vladimir Putin has been operating according to a nineteenth-century worldview, in which great powers dominate their spheres of influence unchallenged. As he noted at last October’s meeting of the Valdai Discussion Club, “The bear will not even bother to ask permission. Here, we consider it the master of the taiga.” The Islamic State is attempting to return to an even more distant past. Its adherents espouse a medieval ninth-century doctrine to justify their effort to reestablish the caliphate, in which “the legality of all emirates, groups, states, and organizations becomes null” and summary execution and slavery are mandatory. The West, too, has fallen into the trap of nostalgia, clinging to a late-twentieth-century conception of order in which it makes the rules and can choose whether to follow them. The latest example of this anachronistic perspective is America’s ham-fisted (not to mention failed) attempt to stem support for the China-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, after repeatedly refusing to provide a greater voice for the world’s emerging powers in the Bretton Woods institutions. Nostalgia has also emerged as a major factor in many countries’ domestic affairs. Throughout Europe, populist parties – from the right-wing United Kingdom Independence Party to the far-left Syriza in Greece – seek a return to the ostensibly simpler and happier times of national control and closed borders. In the US, a prominent strain of jurisprudence defends the “original intent” of the Constitution’s framers, while Republicans are shifting toward isolationism and Democrats are denouncing free-trade agreements. But nostalgia offers no solutions – only a dream of escape. Looking backward gets us no closer to what we want; on the contrary, it is a surefire way to miss the challenges – and miss out on the opportunities – that lie before us. Trying to advance one’s interests based on the rules of the past is like trying to solve today’s crossword puzzle using yesterday’s clues. Let’s face it: the halcyon world to which many people are so eager to return – before, say, the European Union or the United Nations or even the nation-state – never really existed. As Marcel Proust noted: “Remembrance of things past is not necessarily the remembrance of things as they were.” The past is being abridged and sugarcoated in order to portray it as superior to the widespread tumult and misery of today. Over time, nostalgia has come to have a benign connotation. But the word – a combination of the Greek nostos (homecoming) and algos (pain) – was coined to describe the disease of “acute homesickness.” Perhaps it would be beneficial to return to that definition of nostalgia, at least in its political manifestation, as something more akin to an illness: a condition that distorts reality and impedes the formulation of effective solutions for real-world challenges. No worldview rooted in the nineteenth century – much less in the ninth century – is adequate to the complexities of today’s globalized world. Likewise, the rise of new powers and non-state actors means that rule making (and breaking) can no longer be restricted to a small Western club. And the intensity of global competition means that European countries cannot hope to thrive independently of one another. Flimsy ideas thrive in the absence of a viable alternative. That is why a period of reflection on world order is so important. But, rather than allowing ourselves to be swept up in the regressive tide of nostalgia, we need to engage one another in a constructive conversation about the challenges that we actually face and propose new ideas for addressing them.",
            "乡愁政治 马德里 — — 世界秩序 — — 或者说世界秩序的缺失 — — 是现如今的热门话题。 我们对全球结构和体系未来的执着随处可见 — — 这种执着不仅存在于新闻会议、畅销书排行榜，甚至存在于热播的电视节目里。 人们倍感焦虑。 世界似乎正在发生根本的变化：新力量登上世界舞台，此前国际行为神圣不可侵犯的规则正在公然遭到蔑视，与此同时新一轮技术进步浪潮正在扰乱整个行业经济。 我们在这个快速变化的时代本能地追求结构和可预测性，不顾一切地想要了解世界和我们自身将向何处去。 当然，重要的是在这种情况下找到最佳、或至少是最可行的前进线路；可预见性奠定了成本效益分析和战略思维的基础。 问题就出在我们对确定性的向往压倒了理性思维，从而将我们的思想和行动带往低效 — — 甚至是危险的方向。 现在流行带着玫瑰色的回忆就是一个很好的例子。 面对政治、经济、地缘政治和社会动荡，决策者们越来越屈服于怀旧的魅力，信誓旦旦要恢复他们所谓熟悉而完整的过去的规则和惯例。 在俄罗斯，普京总统一直奉行某种19世纪的世界观，认定大国毋庸置疑地主宰自己的势力领域。 去年十月他曾在瓦尔代辩论俱乐部会议上指出 ， “ 熊才懒得去管别人同意不同意。 在我们俄罗斯，熊是主宰针叶林的王者 。 ” 伊斯兰国正试图回到更遥远的过去。 其追随者信奉中世纪9世纪学说来证明自己竭尽全力重建哈里发，目的是让“酋长、团体、国家和组织的合法性全部失效 ” ， 并执行即刻处决和强制奴役。 西方也同样落入到怀旧的陷阱。 他们死抱住二十世纪末的秩序理念不放，固执地认定应由自己来制定规则并选择遵守与否。 这种过时观点的最新例子是美国笨手笨脚（更不用说失败）地试图阻止国际社会支持由中国领导的亚洲基础设施投资银行，之前美国曾一再拒绝在布雷顿森林体系中给这个新兴全球大国更大的发言权力。 怀旧也成为左右许多国家国内事务的主旋律。 在欧洲各国，民粹主义党派 — — 从右翼英国独立党到激进的希腊左翼联盟 — — 都在追求回归表面单纯快乐的国家管制和边界封闭。 在美国，一系列著名的法律体系捍卫着宪法制定者们所谓的“原意 ” ， 而共和党越来越向孤立主义靠拢、民主党则不断谴责自由贸易协议。 但怀旧解决不了任何问题 — — 仅仅是场逃避的美梦而已。 回忆给不了我们想要的东西；相反，它却能让我们错过近在眼前的挑战和机遇。 想要依据过去规则追求自身利益就像用昨天的线索来解今天的填字游戏。 我们必须面对现实：人们如此渴望回归的宁静世界 — — 欧盟、联合国甚至是民族国家建立前的世界 — — 从来就没有存在过。 就像普鲁斯特所说的那样 ： “ 对过去的回忆不一定反映过去本来的样子 。 ” 我们对过去进行了删减和美化，才让它在今天的混乱和痛苦面前更具吸引力。 随着时间的推移，怀旧的内涵变得越来越亲切。 但怀旧一词 — — 希腊语nostos（回家）和algos （痛苦）的组合被放在一起形容“极度想家”的顽疾。 至少在政治表现方面，或许应该回到怀旧最初“更接近于某种疾病”的定义：这种病扭曲现实并妨碍有效解决现实的难题。 没有哪种植根于19世纪 — — 更不用说9世纪 — — 的世界观能够应对今天全球化世界的复杂局势。 同样，全新大国及非国家力量的崛起意味着规则的制定（和打破）不能再作为西方小型俱乐部的专利。 全球竞争的激烈程度意味着欧洲国家不能再关起门来追求富裕。 没有其他可行方案才造成不可行的想法遍地都是。 因此有必要对世界秩序进行反思。 但与其陷在怀旧的倒退潮流里，还不如就世界所面临的挑战进行积极对话并提出新的解决思路。"

            "Managing a World of Great Powers MADRID – Today, great-power competition is a fact: The United States now competes with an increasingly active Russia and a rising China. The Middle East, the South China Sea, and Ukraine are just three theaters where this new reality is playing out. Upon rereading former US Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott’s book The Great Experiment, I was left with the impression that the seeds of some of the dynamics at play today were sown some time ago. The book describes a conversation that took place in December 2000 between President Bill Clinton and President-elect George W. Bush. Clinton says that, judging by Bush’s electoral campaign, the security issues that seemed to concern him most were Saddam Hussein and the construction of a large-scale antimissile defense system. “That’s absolutely right,” Bush responds. These issues were put on hold when tragedy unexpectedly struck, in the form of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in the US, which brought a period of international cooperation during which solidarity against terrorism reigned. It was a time when we were all Americans, and when Bush described Putin as “very straightforward and trustworthy.” The winds began to change that December, when the US announced that it was withdrawing from the Antiballistic Missile Treaty, in order to build an antimissile defense system to protect itself from a potentially nuclearized Iran. This did not go unnoticed in Russia. The US at the time did not seem to understand that a multipolar world order was emerging – one that would make it very difficult to pursue, without serious consequences, the policies that Bush and Clinton had discussed in 2000. In a 2007 speech at the Munich Security Conference, Russian President Vladimir Putin made this plain, vehemently rejecting the intervention in Iraq and especially US plans to expand antimissile defense systems to Europe, calling this an act of aggression toward Russia and a breach of common European security. In the summer of 2008, three events placed the new multipolar order in stark relief. China dazzled the world as host of the Olympic Games, reinforcing its status as a significant international player. Russia’s military actions in Georgia – in the midst of the Games – showed the world that the concept of spheres of influence was still alive and well in the Kremlin. And the collapse the following month of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers, which unleashed a global financial crisis from which the world economy has yet to recover fully, underscored the advanced economies’ vulnerabilities, while largely sparing China. With a new sense of confidence in its great-power status, China seemed to qualify the concept of a “peaceful rise” that its leaders have invoked since the era of Deng Xiaoping, adopting a more muscular foreign-policy approach within its neighborhood. Drawing on alleged historical rights, China began to expand its territorial claims, along with its military presence, in the South and East China Seas. In 2013, tensions peaked when China unilaterally declared an Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) covering territories in the East China Sea that it claims, but Japan controls. Many of the countries affected by China’s actions in the South and East China Seas have security treaties with the US, which has been the major maritime power in the Pacific region since World War II. China’s ADIZ declaration was therefore viewed by the US as a provocation. By expanding its sovereignty claims, China was actually expanding its claims to influence. It has taken the international institutions some time to catch up to the changing world order. The 2010 G-20 summit in Seoul produced an agreement to increase the emerging countries’ quotas in the International Monetary Fund by 2014. But the US Congress refused to ratify the changes, so nothing came of the agreement. China then took matters into its own hands, spearheading the creation of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. Fragmentation of the international institutions seemed imminent – that is, until European countries decided to join the AIIB. Though the US resisted at first, and has still refused to join, that decision was lent some nuance in a later conversation between Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Barack Obama. Meanwhile, Russia was exposing its own renewed foreign-policy ambitions in Ukraine. By violating the Helsinki Final Act in the spring of 2014, Putin placed Russian foreign policy in direct opposition to that of the US and Europe. This position was reaffirmed in September, when Putin decided to intervene in the Syrian conflict, securing for Russia a role in any attempt to bring peace to the country. Today, the world is very different from what some might have imagined at the end of the last century, a decade after the Berlin Wall came down. Historically speaking, 15 years can seem long or short, depending on the intensity of change. During the last 15 years of mounting great-power competition and renewed instability in the Middle East – including the Arab Spring, the rise of the brutal Islamic State, Sunni-Shia proxy wars, and unspeakable human suffering – change has been very intense, to say the least. But confrontation is not the whole story. Promising steps have been made in two critical areas: nuclear non-proliferation, especially through the nuclear deal with Iran, and the fight against climate change, exemplified in the encouraging preparations for the current climate summit in Paris. If there is one lesson to be learned from all of this, it is that well-executed, tenacious diplomacy still holds extraordinary power to resolve conflicts. It remains the best instrument to produce those cooperative outcomes that confrontation effectively impedes.",
            "管理列强的世界 马德里—如今，列强相争已是一个事实：美国与日益活跃的俄罗斯和崛起的中国竞争。 中东、南海和乌克兰只是这一新现实的三个展现舞台。 在阅读美国前副国务卿塔尔博特（Strobe Talbott）的著作《大实验 》 （ The Great Experiment）时，我的印象是今天正在起作用的动态的某些根源很早前就种下了。 该书描述了2000年12月美国总统克林顿和当选总统小布什之间的一段对哈。 克林顿说，从小布什的选战看来，他最担心的安全问题是萨达姆和大规模反导防务系统的建设。 “完全正确 。 ” 小布什回答说。 当意料之外的悲剧发生时 — — 2001年9月11日美国发生恐怖袭击，这带来了一段国际合作时期，世界因为反恐团结在一起 — — 这些问题被搁置起来。 那时，我们都是美国人，而小布什把普京描述为“非常直接，非常值得信任 。 ” 那年12月，风向开始转变，美国宣布它将退出反弹道导弹条约，目的是为了建设反导弹防御系统保护自己免受潜在核力量伊朗的威胁。 这一举动没有逃过俄罗斯的眼睛。 当时的美国似乎并不理解多极的世界正在形成 — — 在这样一个世界里，你很难在不引起严重后果的情况下追求2000年小布什和克林顿所讨论的政策。 2007年，在俄罗斯总统普京在慕尼黑安全会议的演讲中断然拒绝干预伊朗，尤其是美国将其反导弹防御系统扩大到欧洲的计划，称这是对俄罗斯的侵略行为，也违反了共同欧洲安全。 2008年夏，三件事让这一新多极秩序显露无疑。 中国举办了一届令人炫目的奥运会，强化了其作为重要国际行动方的地位。 俄罗斯出兵格鲁吉亚 — — 时间选在了奥运会期间 — — 告诉世界势力范围的概念仍然活生生地存在于克里姆林宫。 9月美国投资银行雷曼兄弟公司倒闭引发了一场全球金融危机，世界经济至今仍未从中复苏，这凸显出发达经济体的弱点，但中国基本上独善其身。 带着对其列强地位的新的信心，中国表面上符合自邓小平时代开始实施的“和平崛起”的概念，但对周边近邻采取了更加强硬的外交方针。 中国基于所谓的历史权利扩大其在南海和东海的领土主张并派兵遣将。 2013年，中国单方面宣布了覆盖其所主张但由日本控制的东海领土的防空识别区。 在南海和东海受到中国行为影响的国家大多与美国签订了安全条约。 自二战以来，美国一直是太平洋地区最主要的海上力量。 因此，在美国看来，中国宣布防空识别区是一种挑衅。 中国扩大其主权主张，实质是在扩大其影响力主张。 国际机构需要一定时间才能跟上变化的国际秩序。 2010年首尔G-10峰会形成了在2014年增加新兴国家IMF投票权的协议。 但美国国会拒绝批准这一变化，因此这一协议等于是一纸空文。 于是中国干脆另起炉灶，牵头成立了亚洲基础设施投资银行。 国际机构的分裂似乎一触即发 — — 直到欧洲国家决定加入亚投行。 尽管美国一开始从中阻挠，并且至今仍拒绝加入，但这一决定在后来中国国家主席习近平和美国总统奥巴马的会谈中有了一些微妙的变化。 与此同时，俄罗斯正在乌克兰暴露其新的外交政策野心。 2014年，普京违反赫尔辛基最终议定书，俄罗斯外交政策开始与美国��欧洲直接冲突。 这一立场在9月得到确认，普京决定干预叙利亚冲突，确保叙利亚和平方案中必须有俄罗斯的存在。 当今世界与上个世纪末、柏林墙倒塌十周年时人们所想象的世界大不相同。 从历史上看，15年既可以很长，也可以很短，取决于变化的剧烈程度。 过去十五年，列强竞争愈演愈烈，中东动荡卷土重来 — — 包括阿拉伯之春、残暴的伊斯兰国的崛起、逊尼派-什叶派代理战争以及不可名状的人道灾难 — — 变化不可不谓剧烈。 但冲突并非故事的全部。 在两大关键领域有了令人振奋的进展：核不扩散（特别是通过伊核协议）以及遏制气候变化（眼下的巴黎气候峰会所呈现出的鼓舞人心的准备工作就是明证 ） 。 如果说我们可以从所有这些发展趋势中学到什么的话，那就是坚韧不拔地做好外交工作依然能够在解决冲突方面起到极大的作用。 外交仍是形成这些大受冲突掣肘的合作成果的最佳工具。"

            "How Press Freedom Is Won ACCRA – Every year on May 3 – World Press Freedom Day – news producers and consumers pause to reflect on the state of global media. This year, as journalists and government officials gather in Ghana for the event’s 25th observance, attention will turn to the myriad pressures and challenges confronting the profession worldwide, and how official and state-sponsored hostility toward the press is threatening democracy. But these concerns, though certainly valid, are not the entire story. Signs of journalistic resilience are also emerging. So, rather than focusing exclusively on the obstacles journalists around the world are facing, let’s mark May 3 by considering the many reasons for optimism. For starters, while no media market is immune to erosion of press freedom, resistance is possible. Recent events in Europe are illustrative. In Slovakia, public outrage over the politically motivated double murder of an investigative journalist, Ján Kuciak, and his fiancée, Martina Kušnírová, forced Prime Minister Robert Fico to resign, and has his successor, Peter Pellegrini, walking a public-relations tightrope. Hungary, too, has experienced its own, albeit tamer, version of journalistic pushback. According to a recent study by the European Journalism Center, despite deepening government control over how the media operates, investigative reporting remains active, and “abuses of the taxpayers’ money are regularly exposed.” To be sure, the media are under attack like never before, and not only from fake news and polarizing presidents. The slaying of nine journalists in Kabul on April 30, in back-to-back suicide bombings that killed at least 25 people, marked the deadliest day for journalists in Afghanistan since the fall of the Taliban, and added to a grim global tally. According to Reporters Without Borders, more than 1,000 journalists have been murdered around the world in the last 15 years, and only a handful of the perpetrators have been brought to justice. And yet fresh glimmers of hope are multiplying. Around the world, journalists and their supporters are fighting back in encouraging ways. Consider online censorship. While governments from China to Russia routinely block or filter access to the Internet, half of the world’s population is now connected – a 20% increase in only five years. In Sudan, journalists are using this connectivity to save lives. Last year, when the government refused to inform the public about a devastating cholera outbreak, journalists with Radio Dabanga, working with doctors and nurses, used the WhatsApp messaging service to share information about prevention and treatment. Even in a violent and divided country like Somalia, the Internet is being used for good; increased streaming speeds have kept members of the country’s sizable diaspora connected with friends and family, and have enabled meaningful dialogue across communities. Legal norms are also moving in the right direction. Between 2011 and 2016, the number of countries with freedom of information laws increased from 90 to 112. This commitment was deepened last month when the European Union adopted a new law to protect whistle-blowers from prosecution. In a statement, authorities said they hoped the measure would be a boon to investigative journalists by protecting sources who report violations of European law. Where fewer legal protections are in place, journalists are becoming more creative. In the Philippines, where independent news organizations have become targets of slander by politicians and online trolls, reporters are turning the tables with devastating effect. For example, in a recent series of reports identifying people making threats against the media, the news website Rappler uncovered a network of trolls tied directly to government insiders. Finally, journalists are working to improve the diversity of their own industry. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, for example, one media organization created a database with the contact details of thousands of female experts who are available for media commentary and analysis. This simple exercise has led to a dramatic increase in the percentage of female experts appearing in the press. These are just a few of the bright spots we should be highlighting during this year’s observance of World Press Freedom Day. Every day, courageous men and women (and sometimes even children) around the world continue to brave the odds to bring us the news. We all benefit from their dedication, and we all have an obligation to honor their successes, not just their sacrifices.",
            "如何赢得言论自由 阿克拉—每年5月3日是世界新闻自由日，这一天，新闻制造者和消费者会停下脚步，深思全球媒体的状态。 今年，记者和政府官员齐聚加纳出席第25个世界新闻自由日活动，关注点将转向世界各地新闻界所面临的各种挑战，以及有官员和国家撑腰的针对新闻媒体的敌意如何威胁民主。 但这些关注点固然是必要的，却并非故事的全部。 新闻韧性（journalistic resilience）的信号也在不断浮现。 因此，我们不必只关注世界各地记者所面临的各种障碍，5月3日有很多理由值得保持乐观。 首先，尽管媒体市场无法免于侵蚀新闻自由，但仍有往保持韧性。 最近在欧洲发生的一系列事件很有说明性。 在斯洛伐克，出于政治动机对调查记者延·库西亚克（Ján Kuciak）和他的未婚妻马丁娜·库什尼罗娃（Martina Kušnírová）的谋杀引起了众怒，迫使总理罗伯特·费科辞职，他的继任者彼得·佩莱格里尼也对公共关系如履薄冰。 匈牙利也经历了新闻压制事件，但没有那么激烈。 据欧洲新闻中心（European Journalism Center）的最新研究，尽管政府对媒体经营加强了控制，但调查报道依然活跃 ， “ 滥用纳税人的钱的亲狂时有曝光 ” 。 平心而论，媒体所遭到的打击从未如此强烈，且打击不仅仅来自假新闻和走极端的国家首脑。 4月30日，喀布尔9名记者被杀害，这一系列背靠背自杀式爆炸至少造成25人死亡，是塔利班倒台以来阿富汗新闻界最血腥的一天，也是全世界的黑暗之日。 据无国界记者组织（Reporters Without Borders）的数据，过去15年中全世界有1,000多名记者被杀害，而只有极少数行凶者被缉拿归案。 但希望的星星之火正在闪现。 放眼全球，记者和他们的支持者正在以令人鼓舞的方式进行反击。 以在线审查为例。 尽管中国和俄罗斯等国政府一直在阻止或过滤互联网接入，但全世界有一半人口已经实现互联 — — 在短短五年中增加了20 % 。 在苏丹，记者利用互联拯救生命。 去年，政府拒绝通知民众灾难性的霍乱疫情，达班加广播（Radio Dabanga）的记者与医生和护士一起使用WhatsApp短信服务分享关于预防和治疗的信息。 即使是索马里等饱受暴力和分裂之苦的国家，互联网也得到了很好的运用：日益提高的网速让数量庞大的索马里侨民得以和亲朋好友保持联系，也让群体之间得以展开有意义的对话。 法律规范也在朝着正确的方向发展。 2011—2016年间，实施信息自由法的国家从90个增加到112个。 上个月，欧盟实施了一项新法律保护告密者免遭起诉，信息自由得到了进一步深化。 当局在一份声明中说，他们希望这项措施可以通过保护报告违反欧洲法律的线人，来提振调查记者。 在法律保护较弱的地方，记者的创造力也会变得更强。 在菲律宾，独立新闻组织成为政客和网络“黑子”造谣中伤的目标，但记者成功地扭转了局面，大获全胜。 比如，在挖掘谁给媒体造成最大威胁的最新系列报道中，新闻网站Rappler挖出一个与政府内部人士有直接关联的“黑子”网络。 最后，记者也在致力于改善本行业的多样性。 比如，刚果共和国的一家媒体组织建立了一个数据库，内有数千名可提供新闻评论和分析的女性专家的联系方式。 这个简单的举措大大提高了女性专家出现在新闻中的百分比。 这些只是我们应该在今年的世界新闻自由日活动中强调的闪光点的一小部分。 每一天，全世界勇敢的男人和女人们（有时甚至也包括儿童）都在不断冲破阻力，让我们看到新闻。 我们所有人都从他们的奉献中获益，我们所有人都有义务表彰他们的成功，而不仅仅是他们的牺牲。"

            "Preventing the Death of the World’s Rivers NEW DELHI – From the Tigris to the Indus and the Yangtze to the Nile, rivers were essential to the emergence of human civilization. Millennia later, hundreds of millions of people still depend on rivers to quench their thirst, grow food, and make a living. And yet we are rapidly destroying the planet’s river systems, with serious implications for our economies, societies, and even our survival. China is a case in point. Its dam-building frenzy and over-exploitation of rivers is wreaking environmental havoc on Asia, destroying forests, depleting biodiversity, and straining water resources. China’s first water census, released in 2013, showed that the number of rivers – not including small streams – had plummeted by more than half over the previous six decades, with over 27,000 rivers lost. The situation has only deteriorated since then. The Mekong River is running at a historically low level, owing largely to a series of Chinese-built mega-dams near the border of the Tibetan Plateau, just before the river crosses into Southeast Asia. In fact, the Tibetan Plateau is the starting point of most of Asia’s major rivers, and China has taken advantage of that, not least to gain leverage over downstream countries. China may be the world’s largest dam builder, but it is not alone; other countries, from Asia to Latin America, have also been tapping long rivers for electricity generation. The diversion of water for irrigation is also a major source of strain on rivers. In fact, crop and livestock production absorbs almost three-quarters of the world’s freshwater resources, while creating runoff that, together with industrial waste and sewage discharge, pollutes those very resources. In total, almost two-thirds of the world’s long rivers have been modified, and some of the world’s longest – including the Nile and the Rio Grande – now qualify as endangered. Of the 21 rivers longer than 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) that still flow freely from their mountain sources to the sea, most are in remote regions of the Arctic and in the Amazon and Congo basins, where hydropower development is not yet economically viable. These trends strain water resources, destroy ecosystems, and threaten human health. For example, heavy upstream diversions have turned the deltas of the Colorado River and the Indus River into saline marshes. Moreover, lower river-water levels impede the annual flooding cycle, which in tropical regions helps to re-fertilize farmland naturally with nutrient-rich sediment. In periods of below-average rainfall, a number of rivers increasingly run dry before reaching the ocean, and even when they do make it, they are depositing less of the nutrients and minerals that are vital to marine life. Globally, aquatic ecosystems have lost half of their biodiversity since the mid-1970s, and about half of all wetlands have been destroyed over the last century. A recent United Nations study warned that up to a million animal and plant species are threatened with extinction, many within decades. Humans are hardly exempt from the health consequences of river destruction. In Central Asia, the Aral Sea has all but dried up in less than 40 years, owing to the Soviet Union’s introduction of cotton cultivation, for which water was siphoned from the sea’s principal sources, the Amu Darya and Syr Darya rivers. Today, particles blown from its exposed seabed – thick with salts and agricultural chemical residue – not only kill crops; they are sickening local people with everything from kidney disease to cancer. Free-flowing rivers play a critical role in moderating the effects of climate change, by transporting decaying organic material and eroded rock to the ocean. This process draws about 200 million tons of carbon out of the air each year. In short, the case for protecting our rivers could not be stronger. Yet, while world leaders are often willing to pay lip service to the imperative of strengthening river protections, their rhetoric is rarely translated into action. On the contrary, in some countries, regulations are being rolled back. In the United States, almost half of rivers and streams are considered to be in poor biological condition. Yet last October, President Donald Trump’s administration repealed “Waters of the US,” which had been introduced by his predecessor, Barack Obama, in order to limit pollution of streams, wetlands, and other bodies of water. Last month, the Trump administration replaced the rule with a far weaker version, called the “Navigable Waters Protection Rule.” Likewise, in Brazil, President Jair Bolsonaro has relaxed environmental rules in the name of economic growth. Among the casualties is the Amazon River, the world’s largest river in terms of discharge, which carries more water than the next ten largest rivers combined. Already, the Amazon basin in Brazil has lost forest cover over an area larger than the entire Democratic Republic of Congo – the world’s 11th-largest country. The absence of water-sharing or cooperative-management arrangements in the vast majority of transnational river basins facilitates such destruction. Many countries pursue projects without regard for their cross-border or environmental effects. One way to protect relatively undamaged river systems – such as the Amur, the Congo, and the Salween – would be to broaden implementation of the 1972 World Heritage Convention, and add these rivers to the World Heritage List, alongside UNESCO World Heritage Sites. This would be in line with recent efforts in some countries – Australia, Bangladesh, Colombia, India, and New Zealand – to grant legal rights to rivers and watersheds. For such initiatives to work, however, effective enforcement is essential. As for the rivers that are already damaged, action must be taken to restore them. This includes artificially recharging rivers and aquifers with reclaimed wastewater; cleaning up pollution; reconnecting rivers with their floodplains; removing excessive or unproductive dams; and implementing protections for freshwater-ecosystem species. The world’s rivers are under unprecedented pressure from contamination, damming, and diversion. International cooperation can save them, but first we must recognize the consequences of doing nothing.",
            "拯救世界河流 新德里–无论是底格里斯河、印度河，还是长江、尼罗河，河流对于人类文明的兴起至关重要。 几千年后，成千上万的人仍然依靠河流来解渴、种植作物和谋生。 但是，我们正在迅速摧毁地球的河流系统，这严重影响了我们的经济、社会乃至我们的生存。 中国就是一个例子。 中国疯狂筑坝、又过度开发河流，这些举动正在破坏亚洲环境，破坏森林，破坏生物多样性，并使水资源紧张。 中国于2013年发布了首次水普查，结果显示，在过去60年中，不包括小溪流的河流数量暴跌了一半以上，损失了27,000多条河流。 而自那时以来，情况也一直在恶化。 湄公河的水位一直处于历史上的低位，这主要是由于在河流分流进入东南亚之前，中国在青藏高原边界附近修建了一系列大型水坝。 而青藏高原正是亚洲大多数主要河流的起点，而中国则利用了这一点，尤其是在对下游国家的影响力方面。 中国可能是世界上最大的水坝建设者，但并非孤例。 从亚洲到拉丁美洲，其他国家也一直在利用河流发电。 抽河水灌溉，也是河流水资源紧张的主要原因。 实际上，农作物和牲畜的生产吸收了世界近四分之三的淡水资源，同时又产生了径流，径流再加上工业废物和污水排放，严重污染了这些资源。 总体而言，世界上将近三分之二的长河已被改造，世界上最长的一些河道（包括尼罗河和里奥格兰德河）已被认定为濒临灭绝。 在长度仍超过1000公里（620英里）仍能从山区水源自由流向大海的21条河流中，大多数位于北极偏远地区以及亚马孙河和刚果盆地，那里要用水力发电尚无经济效益。 这些趋势使水资源紧张，破坏生态系统并威胁人类健康。 例如，上游的大量改道将科罗拉多河和印度河的三角洲变成了盐沼。 此外，较低的河流水位阻碍了年度洪水周期。 在热带地区，该周期有助于利用营养丰富的沉积物自然使农田肥沃。 在降雨量低于平均水平的时期，许多河流在到达海洋之前逐渐变得干涸。 即使到达海洋，这些河流中沉积的营养物质和矿物质也更少，而这些物质对海洋生物至关重要。 在全球范围内，自1970年代中期以来，水生生态系统已经丧失了一半的生物多样性，并且在上个世纪，大约一半的湿地被破坏。 联合国最近的一项研究警告说，多达数十万种动植物正面临灭绝的威胁，其中许多在几十年之内就将灭绝。 破坏河流也影响了人类健康。 在中亚，由于前苏联引进了棉花种植，从咸海的主要水源 — — 阿姆河（Amu Darya）和锡尔河（Syr Darya）河中抽取了水，咸海几乎在不到40年的时间内就干涸了。 如今，从裸露的海底吹来的颗粒富含盐和农药残留，不仅杀死了农作物，也使当地人患上各类疾病，包括肾脏疾病和癌症。 自由流动的河流通过将腐烂的有机物质和侵蚀的岩石运到海洋，在减缓气候变化的影响方面起着关键作用。 每年，这一过程从空气中吸收约2亿吨碳。 简而言之，保护我们河流的理由再有力不过了。 然而，尽管世界各国领导人通常愿意口头上说一说加强河流保护的必要性，但他们的言论很少转为行动。 相反，在某些国家，法规正在开倒车。 在美国，几乎一半的河流和小溪被认为生物状况很差。 然而，去年10月，特朗普总统的政府废除了前任总统奥巴马提出的“美国水域”法规，该法旨在限制对溪流、湿地和其他水域的污染。 上个月，特朗普政府以弱得多的版本取代了该规则，称为“可航行水域保护规则 ” 。 同样，在巴西，总统贾尔·博尔索纳罗（Jair Bolsonaro）以经济增长的名义放宽了环境规定。 该规定牺牲了亚马逊河。 就流量而言，亚马逊河是世界上最大的河流，其流量超过除它之外的十大河流之和。 巴西的亚马逊流域已经失去了相当于覆盖整个刚果民主共和国的森林覆盖，而刚果是世界上面积第十一大的国家。 绝大多数跨国流域缺乏分水或合作管理的安排，更加速了这种破坏。 许多国家在进行项目时并未考虑其邻居或者环境影响。 保护相对未受破坏的河流系统（例如阿穆尔河、刚果河和萨尔温江河）的一种方法是扩大1972年《世界遗产公约》的执行范围，并将这些河流与联合国教科文组织世界遗产一起列入《世界遗产名录 》 。 这与澳大利亚、孟加拉国、哥伦比亚、印度和新西兰等一些国家最近为赋予河流和流域合法权利而作出的努力一致。 但是，要使这些举措奏效，必须要有效的执行。 至于已经被破坏的河流，必须采取行动将其恢复。 这包括：用再生废水人工补充河流和地下水；清理污染；使河流与洪泛区重新连接；拆除过多或无用的水坝；并保护淡水生态系统物种。 污染、筑坝和改道使世界河流承受着前所未有的压力。 国际合作可以拯救这些河流，但首先我们必须认识到无所作为的后果。"

            "Worlds Apart Macroeconomic policies, financial globalization, and changes in labor market institutions have exacerbated inequality in recent decades, not only in income and wealth, but also in access to education, healthcare, social protection, as well as in political participation and influence. Even within countries experiencing rapid economic growth, an array of factors, exacerbated by tremendous demographic changes, has conspired to transmit inequality of knowledge, social responsibility, and life chances from one generation to the next. As surveyed in the United Nations report The Inequality Predicament, few countries, rich or poor, have proved immune to the global trend of rising inequality, or to its consequences for education, health, and social welfare. Of course, there is no simple causal relationship linking poverty and inequality to violence. But inequality and a sense of deprivation do contribute to resentment and social instability, threatening security. Excluded and facing bleak life prospects, young people, in particular, often experience anomie and may turn to anti-social behavior, including violence. Nor is there a simple explanation of what causes poverty. Clearly, however, poverty arises from various complex conditions, and its amelioration requires a multidimensional approach. It is hard to imagine, for example, how to “make poverty history” without also generating enough decent work, educational opportunities, and healthcare for all. To be sure, the world has seen progress on some fronts in recent decades. Access to education for girls has improved, and some gender gaps have been reduced. Despite AIDS and the resurgence of malaria and tuberculosis, life expectancy has increased in much of the world due to improved public health systems. Overall, however, the inequality gaps are large and, in many cases, growing. The most important determinant of income inequality today is wealth inequality, with the increasing concentration of asset ownership in recent years principally responsible for greater income inequality in most countries. Meanwhile, growing unemployment, widening skill and productivity gaps, and the “informalization” or “casualization” of labor markets have exacerbated income inequalities worldwide, as the number of “working poor” and the incidence of “jobless growth” has spread. Nor have stabilization and structural adjustment programs, imposed since the 1980’s, delivered on their promise of achieving higher economic growth. Growth in much of the world during the past quarter-century has been slower than in the previous 25 years, despite more rapid growth in East Asia, India, and a few other countries. Such growth differences suggest that overall global inequality may not have increased unequivocally. But inequalities at the national level have deepened in most countries in recent years, largely due to economic liberalization at both the national and international levels. Indeed, in much of the world, such economic reforms have actually undermined growth rates as well as the progressive role of government, while otherwise increasing overall inequalities. The few exceptions have been due largely to continued or new progressive government interventions. But they are exceptions: the cumulative impact of these reforms over the past 25 years has been greater inequality in most developed and developing countries, with rising unemployment, greater earnings disparities, reduced social protection, and environmental degradation. International financial liberalization, for example, has undermined the use of more inclusive and targeted developmental credit to promote desired economic activities. In addition, contrary to the promises of its proponents, financial liberalization has actually resulted in net capital flows from the capital-poor to the capital-rich over the long term, while increasing financial volatility and weakening economic activity. Meanwhile, free-trade negotiations seem to ignore historical trends. Developing countries’ international terms of trade have worsened: prices of primary commodities have declined in relation to manufactures, as have tropical agriculture prices against temperate agriculture, and prices of generic manufactures have fallen relative to output protected by intellectual property rights. As a result, trade liberalization of manufactures has resulted in de-industrialization and greater unemployment in much of the world, as in the case of garments this year. And, while agricultural trade liberalization may enhance export earnings for some poor countries, the main beneficiaries will be the more well-to-do agricultural exporters. Countries that import currently subsidized food will be worse off. The “retreat of the state” in much of the developing world in recent decades has involved a generally reduced role for government, including the capacity to lead and sustain development, as well as its progressive social interventions in areas such as public education, health, housing, and utilities. The economic liberalization carried out in much of the world in the last 25 years was a flawed policy from the start, and its consequences have become glaringly obvious. Unless the world refocuses economic policies to address the adverse impact of economic inequality on growth and poverty reduction, the poor and the privileged will continue to live worlds apart.",
            "分离的世界 宏观经济政策、金融全球化和劳力市场体制的变化加速了近几十年的不平等状况。 这种不平等不仅表现在收入和财富上，也表现在接受教育、医疗、社会保护以及政治参与和影响方面。 即便是在经济快速发展的国家，由人口统计上的巨大变化所驱动的一系列因素，已经悄然将知识、社会责任和生活机会的不平等从一代人转移到下一代人。 正如联合国的一份调查报告《不平等困境》中所示，不论贫富，几乎没有国家能够避免全球化大趋势和日益严重的不平等，或由这两者带来的教育、健康和社会福利方面的影响。 当然，在贫穷和不平等与暴力之间并没有一种简单而随意的联系。 但不平等和一种被剥夺感的确会引发怨恨情绪和社会不稳定，从而威胁到安全。 被排斥和面临暗淡的生活前景，尤其会使年轻人感到困惑无奈并可能诉诸包括暴力在内的反社会行为。 在造成贫困的原因方面也没有一个简单的解释。 然而，贫困显然是由不同复杂条件造成的，需要多管齐下来改善。 比如，很难想象我们如何在没有为所有人提供足够的良好工作、教育机会和医疗保健的情况下 ， “ 创造扶贫的历史 ” 。 平心而论，近几十年，世界在一些方面取得了进步。 女童接受教育的状况得到改善，有些性别鸿沟缩小了。 尽管有艾滋病和疟疾、肺结核的卷土重来，但由于公共医疗体系的改善，在世界很多地方人们的预期寿命都有所提高。 但总的说来，不平等的鸿沟仍然巨大，并仍在扩大之中。 当今收入不平等的决定性因素是财富不平等。 近几年愈演愈烈的产权集中化是造成大多数国家更严重收入不平等的首要因素。 同时，随着“贫困劳工”和“无工作增长”的蔓延，日益严重的失业问题，日渐扩大的技能和生产力差距，和劳力市场的“非正式化”或“随意化”更加重了世界范围内的收入不平等。 从1980年代就开始实施的稳定和结构调整计划，也未能实现其所承诺地更高经济增长。 尽管有东亚、印度和其他几个国家的高速经济增长，世界许多地方在过去25年以来的经济增长还是慢于此前的25年。 这种增长差异表明全球的总体不平等可能并没有明确地加剧。 就国家层面而言，近几年，不平等在大多数国家都变得更为深刻。 这主要是由于在国家和国际层面上的经济自由化造成的。 的确，在世界的许多地方，这样的经济改革已经妨碍了经济增长和政府的推动作用，同时在其他方面增加了总体的不平等。 少数几个例外主要是由于锐意改革的政府新近或持续性的干预。 但他们仅仅是例外：过去25年来的经济改革的累积后果是在大多数发达国家和发展中国家造成更大的不平等、持续攀升的失业率、更大的收入差距、更弱的社会保护和环境恶化。 例如，国际金融自由化已经妨碍了我们使用更具包容性和目的性的发展信贷来促进我们期望的经济活动。 另外，与其支持者的承诺正好相反，长期而言，金融自由化实际上造成了净资本从资本穷国向资本富国流动，同时增加了金融不稳定性并弱化了经济活动。 同时，自由贸易谈判似乎忽视了历史趋势。 发展中国家的国际贸易条件恶化了：与工业品相比的初级商品价格下跌，热带农产品的价格相对温带农产品下跌，普通工业品的价格也相对于受知识产权保护的产品下跌。 其结果，是工业品贸易自由化造成了世界许多地区地更高失业率和非工业化，就像今年的服装行业一样。 农业贸易自由化可能会增加有些穷国的出口创收，但主要的获益者将会是更富有的农业出口国。 而目前进口享受补贴的食品的国家的情况将会恶化。 近几十年在许多发展中国家实行的“政府引退”造成了政府职能整体上的弱化，其中包括主导和维持发展的能力，以及在公共教育、健康、住房和公用事业方面的进步性社会干预。 过去25年里，在世界许多地方实施的经济自由化先天不足，其后果触目惊心。 除非我们重新调整经济政策，以修正在增长和减轻贫困方面的经济不���等所带来的不良后果，否则穷人和富人会继续生活在两个不同世界之中。"

            "The World’s Stake in American Democracy NEW YORK – For more than three-quarters of a century, the United States has played an outsized, constructive role in the world. To be sure, there have been major errors, including the Vietnam War and the 2003 Iraq War, but the US got it right far more often than not. The results speak for themselves. US entry into World War II proved decisive. In part because of American urging, the colonial era came to a rapid if not always peaceful end. The creation of a postwar order of alliances helped to ensure the Cold War stayed cold and ended on terms consistent with Western interests and values. A range of institutions and policies provided the foundation for unprecedented global economic growth and extension of lifespans. But the ability of the US to continue to play a large and influential global role is increasingly uncertain. Some reasons have nothing to do with the US but affect its position all the same. There are new external challenges. The US economy, responsible for half the world’s output after WWII, now produces only one-fourth. Military force is now widely distributed among other countries and groups. Energy and mineral resources, along with manufacturing hubs on which the US and others depend, are widely distributed. This distribution of power and wealth gives others the ability to resist or counter US influence and might. America’s position in this world is one of overall primacy, but not domination. America’s ability to have its way is further limited by globalization. Be it climate change or viruses, the US cannot wall itself off from the costly consequences of developments beyond its borders or generate solutions on its own. Neither isolationism nor unilateralism is a viable option. What might be the most serious threat to global security and stability, though, stems from developments within the US, from the deep political and social divisions that threaten the country’s competitiveness, its ability to design and implement consistent policy, and even its stability. No doubt some readers will feel more than a little schadenfreude at all this and take satisfaction from US difficulties following decades of having to follow America’s lead. But any such satisfaction will be short-lived, because in a world that is sometimes violent and always global, America’s difficulties can and will quickly become theirs. Further erosion of American democracy will be used by anti-democratic governments elsewhere to justify and extend their repression of their own populations. And, absent a strong US economy, other countries’ economies will grow more slowly as their exports lag. A weaker and less predictable US would fray the fabric of alliances, which to be effective require mutual assistance to be near-certain. Similarly, foes would grow emboldened in the belief they could act with impunity. The result would be a world of more frequent conflict, one in which advanced weapons proliferate more widely and aggressive countries wield more influence. Moreover, a US that is distracted and divided at home would lack the capacity and the consensus to exercise leadership on global challenges such as climate change. Without American resources and leadership, the already large gap between these global challenges and global responses would almost certainly grow. There is no other country or group of countries both willing and able to take America’s place on the world stage. The question, then, is whether the US will soon regain its footing and come to resemble the country of the past 75 years. There are some reassuring signs. American economic and military support for Ukraine has been robust. The November 2022 midterm election results were reassuring in that many of the most extreme candidates posing the greatest threat to American democracy were defeated. But there are also less reassuring developments. We just marked the second anniversary of the January 6, 2021, assault on the US Capitol, which came close to destroying American democracy. No one can assume that such violent protests will not happen again. And now that divided government is once more a reality, it remains to be seen whether a Democratic president and Senate can find any common ground with a Republican-led House of Representatives. Early signs are not good, as the newly empowered Republicans seem more focused on investigating and obstructing than on legislating and leading. Winston Churchill famously said, “You can always count on Americans to do the right thing – after they’ve tried everything else.” That dictum is about to be tested. The problem for the rest of the world is that it will be affected in significant ways by what happens in the US but has little or no ability to influence developments there. It is an uncomfortable but unavoidable reality.",
            "美国民主中的世界利益 纽约 — — 美国在这个世界发挥巨大的建设性作用已经持续了超过3/4个世纪。 可以肯定，美国曾犯过一些重大错误，包括越南战争和2003年的伊拉克战争，但美国做对的事要远多于做错的事。 结果是不言自明的。 美国加入二战被证明是决定性的。 在一定程度上，由于美国的敦促，殖民时代迅速终结，即使这种终结并不总是和平的。 战后联盟秩序的建立有助于确保冷战继续成之为冷战，并以符合西方利益和价值观的方式结束。 一系列机构和政策为前所未有的全球经济增长和寿命延长奠定了基础。 但美国是否有能力继续在全球扮演重要而有影响力角色却越来越不确定。 有些原因与美国无关，但却同样影响其立场。 全新外部挑战浮出水面。 第2次世界大战后曾占世界产量一半的美国经济现在仅占全球1/4的产量。 其他国家和团体现在也普遍拥有军事力量。 能源和矿产资源，以及美国和其他国家所依赖的制造业中心呈四散分布状。 这样的实力和财富分配导致其他国家有能力抵制或对抗美国的影响力和力量。 美国在这个世界上的地位是总体领先，但却不是支配性的。 美国自行其事的能力进一步受限于全球化。 无论是气候变化还是病毒，美国均无法隔离境外事态发展所带来的代价高昂的后果，也无法制定自行其事的解决之道。 孤立主义和单边主义都不是可行的选项。 但全球安全与稳定所遭受的最严重威胁可能源于美国内部的事态发展，来自威胁美国竞争力、其设计和实施连续政策能力甚至是美国国内稳定的深层次政治和社会分歧。 毫无疑问，有些读者可能会感到有些幸灾乐祸，几十年来不得不服从美国的领导使得他们对美国的困难感到满足。 但任何这样的满足感都将非常短暂，因为在一个有时充满暴力，而且总是全球化的世界里，美国的困难将很快传导到他们自己的国家。 其他地方的反民主政府会抓住机会进一步侵蚀美国民主，为其进一步镇压本国民众寻找理由。 而且，失去强劲的美国经济，其他国家的经济增长将会放缓，因为出口增速可能滞后。 更加脆弱、不可预测的美国将破坏联盟结构，而保障联盟的有效性需要近乎确定的互助。 同样，敌人会越来越大胆，因为他们相信自己可以不受惩罚。 结果将造就一个冲突更加频繁的世界，先进武器进一步扩散，侵略国家的影响力加大。 此外，美国国内的思想不集中和分裂将影响其内部达成共识，就气候变化等全球挑战发挥领导作用。 没有美国的资源和领导，这些全球挑战和全球对策间本已存在的巨大差异将会进一步拉大。 没有其他国家或国家集团既愿意也有能力取代美国在世界舞台上扮演领导角色。 因此，问题在于，美国是否会很快重新站稳脚跟，变得像过去75年那样。 已经出现了某些令人放心的迹象。 美国对乌克兰的经济和军事支持非常强劲。 2022年11月的中期选举结果令人放心，因为对美国民主造成最大威胁的绝大多数极端候选人都被击败了。 但也有不那么令人放心的事态发展。 我们刚刚纪念了美国国会大厦遭袭两周年，而这场袭击几乎摧毁了美国民主。 没有人可以确保这样的暴力抗议活动不会再次爆发。 目前的现实是政府再次分裂，民主党总统和参议院能否与共和党所领导的众议院达成共识尚有待观察。 早期迹象并不令人乐观，因为刚接手权力的共和党似乎并不在意立法和领导，而更关心阻挠和调查。 温斯顿·丘吉尔曾说过一句名言 ， “ 在完成一切试错之后，你总能期待美国人做出正确的选择 。 ” 这句名言现在很快就要面临考验了。 世界其他地区的问题是，它们将在很大程度上受美国事态的影响，但却根本或几乎没有能力来影响美国。 这个现实令人不安，但却是无法避免的。"

            "Whither the Multilateral Trading System? BRUSSELS – Free trade seems to have few supporters these days. Though actual trade volumes are recovering from the post-crisis recession and drop in commodity prices, “globalization” has become increasingly contentious, as exemplified by the election of US President Donald Trump on the back of a promise to rip up international agreements and get tough on trade partners. What does this mean for the future of the rules-based trading system? Some 60 years ago, when the current rules-based global trading system was conceived, the United States was the world’s sole economic “hyperpower,” possessing unquestioned dominance in the day’s most advanced manufacturing industries. With enough power to impose rules, and enough dominance to be able to count on accruing the largest share of the benefits, it could – and did – perform the role of “benevolent hegemon.” As Japan and Europe recovered from World War II – with the latter getting an added boost from economic integration – America’s lead began to dwindle, and by the 1970s and 1980s, the US was sharing power over the world’s trade agenda with Europe. Nonetheless, because the US and Europe share so many common interests, they generally adhered to a cooperative approach. It was not until imports began to overwhelm a growing number of industries in the US, fueling the emergence of large and persistent external deficits, that the country’s trade policy became more defensive, creating friction with many of its partners. Yet, even then, US leaders understood the value of the liberal multilateral trading system, and supported the establishment, in 1995, of the World Trade Organization as the successor to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The WTO’s creation amounted to a major step forward, as it addressed not just tariffs, but also other trade barriers, including indirect barriers arising from domestic regulations. Given the complexity of assessing how domestic regulations might impede trade, especially compared to judging whether a tariff has been correctly applied, the WTO needed effective dispute-settlement mechanisms, with members agreeing to binding arbitration. The system worked, because its major members recognized the legitimacy of independent panels, even if they sometimes deliver politically inconvenient judgments. Yet this recognition is now increasingly in doubt. Consider what type of economy would support a rules-based system. After WWII, the US supported such a system, because of its unassailable economic supremacy. An open rules-based system would also be highly appealing in a world comprising only small countries, none of which could hope to gain by relying on its relative economic power. Things become more complicated when the global economy includes a small number of economies of similar size, larger than the small economies from the previous example, but not large enough to dominate the system alone. That is the scenario the Nobel laureate economist Paul Krugman considered in a 1989 paper on bilateralism, in which he reported that a world consisting of three major trading blocs constitutes the worst constellation for trade, as a lack of explicit cooperation among all three would lead to increasing trade barriers. Unfortunately, this is exactly the situation in which the global economy finds itself today. There are three dominant economies or trading blocs – China, the European Union, and the US – with very similar trade volumes (exports plus imports) of around $4 trillion each. (Japan, which was a strong contender 25 years ago, now has a much smaller trade volume.) Together, the G3 economies account for 40% of world trade and 45% of global GDP. With economic power distributed in this way, explicit cooperation by all three actors is crucial. Yet there are compelling reasons why they would be reticent to pursue such cooperation. Even if Trump weren’t president, the current global trading system would present problems for the US, whose trade policy has long focused on manufactured goods. (Trade in raw materials has always been relatively free, and trade in agricultural goods has usually been considered special, and thus not subject to rules like the “most favored nation” principle, which applies to manufactures.) Because the US is now self-sufficient in energy, it needs to export fewer manufactured goods than industrialized countries with no domestic energy resources. Annual US exports of manufactured goods thus now amount to only about $1 trillion annually – significantly less than both the EU and China, which export almost twice as much in manufactured goods, despite having somewhat smaller economies. To be sure, Trump is unlikely to start an outright trade war, because any US tariff would harm the interests of the country’s largest companies, which have invested huge sums in production facilities abroad. Yet no individual firm will be willing to give up much of its political capital to defend the rules-based system, either, because it would have to bear the losses, while its competitors shared the gains. The same goes for the G3 trading blocs: if the EU expends political capital to stop the US from undermining WTO mechanisms, China (and the rest of world) will reap most of the gains. That dynamic goes some way toward explaining why China’s leaders, despite having proclaimed their support for the multilateral rules-based trading system, haven’t taken concrete action to reinforce it. Their reticence is probably intensified by the assumption that, within the current generation, their country will dominate the global economy; at that point, they might no longer want to be bound by somebody else’s rules. It does not help matters that the Communist Party of China has recently been empowered even further in all areas of the economy, with all major firms now having to accept a CPC representative on their board. It is difficult to see how a dominant economic power governed by a single party – especially one with such extensive control over the economy – would accept the primacy of international rules and procedures over domestic considerations. The conclusion is clear. The world should prepare itself for the erosion of the rules-based trading system enshrined in the WTO.",
            "多边贸易体系将走向何方？ 发自布鲁塞尔 — — 自由贸易的支持者最近好像没剩几个了。 尽管实际贸易量正在从危机后的衰退中复苏，大宗商品的价格也逐步下降，但是围绕“全球化”的争议却日益喧嚣，对此美国总统特朗普的当选就是明证 — — 此人的口号就是要撕毁国际协定并强硬对待贸易伙伴。 那么对于基于规则的贸易体系来说，这又预示着一个什么样的未来？ 大约60年前，也就是当前这个以规则为基础的全球贸易体系被构思出来的时候，美国是世界上唯一的经济“超级大国 ” ， 在当时最先进的制造产业中占据着无可置疑的主导地位。 既然有了足够的权力来施加规则，又有足够的统治力来确保获得最大的利益份额，它可以 （也确实）扮演着“仁慈的霸主”这一角色。 随着日本和欧洲从二战中复苏 — — 后者还得到了经济一体化的进一步推动，美国的领先优势开始缩小，到了1970年代和80年代，美国开始与欧洲分享制定世界贸易议程的权力。 尽管如此，由于美欧之间存在着诸多共同利益，它们一般还会坚持走合作路线。 但直到进口开始压垮越来越多的美国工业部门并刺激产生了巨额且持续的对外贸易逆差之后，该国的贸易政策才开始变得更加富有防御性，进而与许多合作伙伴产生摩擦。 然而即使如此，美国领导人也清楚意识到自由主义多边贸易体系的价值，并支持在1995年建立世界贸易组织来作为关税和贸易总协定的接班人。 世界贸易组织的创设堪称向前迈进的重要一步，因为它不仅应对关税问题，还处理其他贸易壁垒，包括那些因国内法规产生的间接壁垒。 鉴于评估国内法规贸易妨害程度的工作相对判断关税是否正确征收来说显得尤为复杂，世贸组织需要有效的争端解决机制以及得到成员国同意的有约束力仲裁机制。 这个制度最终奏效了，因为它的主要成员国都承认各个独立（仲裁）小组的合法性，即便后者有时会做出一些在政治上挺棘手的判决。 然而这种认识如今却越来越遭到怀疑。 试问究竟有哪种什么类型的经济体会支持一套基于规则的体系呢？ 二战后的美国支持这么一套体系，因为它拥有无与伦比的经济优势。 一套以规则为基础的公开体系在一个只存在小国的世界中也是非常有吸引力的，因为这些国家都不可能依靠其相对的经济实力来获得好处。 当全球经济涵盖了少数几个规模相近，比上文中的小经济体要大却又不足以单独控制整个体系的经济体时，事情就变得更复杂了。 诺贝尔经济学奖得主保罗·克鲁格曼（Paul Krugman）在1989年发表的一篇关于双边主义的论文中指出一个由三大主要贸易集团组成的世界将会是最差劲的贸易组合，由于三者之间缺乏明确的合作关系，贸易壁垒将因此增加。 不幸的是，这正是全球经济的现状。 三大主要经济体/贸易集团 — — 中国，欧盟和美国 — — 的贸易量（出口量加进口量）都在4万亿美元左右（25年前的日本也是一个强有力的竞争者，但该国当前的贸易量就小太多了 ） 。 三方经济体合共占据了世界贸易的40％以及全球GDP的45 ％ 。 在经济权力如此分配的状态下，所有三个行动者的明确合作就变得至关重要了。 但也有着令人信服的理由来解释为何各方都不愿意推进这类合作 ， 。 即使特朗普不当选总统，目前的全球贸易体系也会给美国带来麻烦，因为美国的贸易政策长期以来都集中在制成品上（原料贸易一直都相对自由，农产品贸易通常被认为是特殊的，因此不受制于类似制造业“最惠国待遇”条款的那类规定 ） 。 由于美国现在能源上实现了自给，因此无须像那些缺乏国内能源供应的工业国家那样出口那么多的制成品。 当前美国的年均制成品出口额仅为1万亿美元左右，远低于欧盟和中国，后两者虽然经济规模略小，但各自的制成品出口额几乎是美国的两倍。 可以肯定的是，特朗普不太可能发起一场惊天动地的贸易战，因为美国施加的任何关税都会损害本国那些大型企业的利益 — — 它们在国外生产设施投资上可是花了大钱的。 同时也没有哪个企业愿意舍弃一大笔政治资本来维护基于规则的体系，因为它将不得不蒙受损失，而分享收益的却是竞争对手。 三大贸易集团也是如此：如果欧盟花费政治资本阻止美国破坏WTO机制，最大的得益者就将是中国（以及世界其他地区 ） 。 这种动态有助于解释为何中国领导人虽然宣称支持以多边规则为基础的贸易体系，却一直未能采取具体行动来对其加以强化。 而令他们更倾向于保持缄默的可能是这么一个假设：在这一代人的时间内他们的国家将主宰全球经济；因此在这一点上，他们可能不再想受制于别人的规则。 更无奈的是中国共产党最近在国内各经济领域的权力都得到了进一步加强，以至于所有大企业如今都不得不接受在董事会里安插一个党代表席位。 很难想象一个由一党派执政的经济强国 — — 尤其一个对经济有着如此广泛控制的政党 — — 如何会让国际规则和程序凌驾于国内考虑因素之上。 结论其实很明确：世界是时候准备好迎来一个逐渐崩塌的WTO贸易体系了。"

            "Ready or Not for the Next Recession? COPENHAGEN – A sunny day is the best time to check whether the roof is watertight. For economic policymakers, the proverbial sunny day has arrived: with experts forecasting strong growth, now is the best time to check whether we are prepared for the next recession. The answer, for the United States in particular, is a resounding no. Policymakers normally respond to recessions by cutting interest rates, reducing taxes, and boosting transfers to the unemployed and other casualties of the downturn. But the US is singularly ill-prepared, for a combination of economic and political reasons, to respond normally. Most obviously, the US Federal Reserve’s target for the federal funds rate is still only 1.25%-1.5%. If no recession is imminent, the Fed may succeed in raising rates three times by the end of the year, to around 2%. But that would still leave little room for monetary easing in response to recessionary trends before the policy rate hits zero again. In the last three recessions, the Fed’s cumulative interest-rate cuts have been close to five full percentage points. This time, because slow recovery has permitted only gradual normalization of interest rates, and because there appears to have been a tendency for interest rates to trend downward more generally, the Fed lacks room to react. In principle, the Fed could launch another round of quantitative easing. In addition, at least one of US President Donald Trump’s nominees to the Federal Reserve Board has mooted the idea of negative interest rates. That said, this Fed board, with its three Trump appointees, is likely to be less activist and innovative than its predecessor. And criticism by the US Congress of any further expansion of the Fed’s balance sheet would be certain and intense. Fiscal policy is the obvious alternative, but Congress has cut taxes at the worst possible time, leaving no room for stimulus when it is needed. Adding $1.5 trillion more to the federal debt will create an understandable reluctance to respond to a downturn with further tax cuts. As my Berkeley colleagues Christina and David Romer have shown, fiscal policy is less effective in countering recessions, and less likely to be used, when a country has already incurred a high public debt. Instead of stimulating the economy in the next downturn, the Republicans in Congress are likely to respond perversely. As revenues fall and the deficit widens even faster, they will insist on spending cuts to return the debt trajectory to its previous path. Congressional Republicans will most likely start with the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which provides food to low-income households. SNAP is already in their sights. They will then proceed to cut Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. The burden of these spending cuts will fall on hand-to-mouth consumers, who will reduce their own spending dollar for dollar, denting aggregate demand. For their part, state governments, forced by new limits on the deductibility of state and local taxes to pare their budgets, are likely to move further in the direction of limiting the duration of unemployment benefits and the extent of their own food and nutrition assistance. Nor will global conditions favor the US. Foreign central banks, from Europe to Japan, have similarly scant room to cut interest rates. Even after a government in Germany is finally formed, policymakers there will continue to display their characteristic reluctance to use fiscal policy. And if Germany doesn’t use its fiscal space, there will be little room for its eurozone partners to do so. More than that, scope for the kind of international cooperation that helped to halt the 2008-2009 contraction has been destroyed by Trump’s “America First” agenda, which paints one-time allies as enemies. Other countries will work with the US government to counter the next recession only if they trust its judgment and intentions. And trust in the US may be the quantity in shortest supply. In 2008-2009, the Fed extended dollar swap lines to foreign central banks, but came under congressional fire for “giving away” Americans’ hard-earned money. Then, at the London G20 summit in early 2009, President Barack Obama’s administration made a commitment to coordinate its fiscal stimulus with that of other governments. Today, almost a decade later, it is hard to imagine the Trump administration even showing up at an analogous meeting. The length of an economic expansion is not a reliable predictor of when the next downturn will come. And the depth and shape of that recession will depend on the event triggering it, which is similarly uncertain. The one thing we know for sure, though, is that expansions don’t last forever. A storm will surely come, and when it does, we will be poorly prepared for the deluge.",
            "准备好下一次衰退了吗？ 哥本哈根—艳阳天是检查天花板是否漏水最好的时候。 对经济决策者来说，谚语中的艳阳天已经到来：专家们纷纷预测给力的增长，因此，这是检查我们是否为下一次衰退做好准备的最好时候。 答案 — — 特别是对美国而言 — — 是响亮的“否 ” 。 决策者应对衰退的通常手段是降低利率、减少税收以及提高面向失业者和其他衰退受害者的转移支付。 但由于各种经济和政治原因，美国完全没有做好常规应对准备。 最显而易见的是，美联储联邦基金利率目标仍然只有1.25 % — 1.5 % 。 如果近期不发生衰退，美联储可能到今年年底成功升息三次至2%左右。 但如果发生衰退性趋势，货币宽松到政策利率为零的程度仍然是杯水车薪。 在过去三次衰退中，美联储累计降息幅度都接近整整五个百分点。 这一次，由于慢复苏导致利率只能逐渐正常化，并且出现了一般性的利率下降趋势，美联储行动空间十分有限。 理论上，美联储可以发动新一轮量化宽松。 此外，在美国总统特朗普所提名的美联储理事人选中，至少有一人提出过负利率的概念。 尽管如此，包括三位特朗普任命人选在内的美联储理事会不太可能会比上一届更加积极和创新。 美国国会也肯定会激烈地批评美联储的任何进一步扩大资产负债表的举动。 财政政策是显而易见的替代方案，但国会在最糟糕的时候选择了减税，这使得真正需要的时候不再有刺激空间。 让联邦债务增加1.5万亿美元将产生对衰退时期进一步减税的抵制反应，这一点不难理解。 我的伯克利同事卡里斯蒂娜·罗默和大卫·罗默（Christina and David Romer）指出，如果一国已经积累了很高的公共债务，那么财政政策在抵御衰退方面效果较低，采用的可能性也较小。 国会中的共和党不太可能在下一次衰退中采取刺激经济的手段，而是会表现得更加顽固。 随着收入的下降和赤字更快的增加，他们将把减支进行到底，让债务轨迹重回此前的轨道。 国会共和党最有可能拿补充营养援助计划（Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program，SNAP）开刀。 SNAP是一项低收入家庭提供食物的计划，目前已经被国会共和党盯上。 接着，他们会把砍刀挥向医疗保险（Medicare ） 、 医疗补助（Medicaid）和社会保险。 这些减支措施的负担将落在无隔宿之粮的消费者头上，他们将一点一点地减少支出，从而拖累总需求。 至于州政府，迫于州和地方税抵扣的新限制吞噬了它们的预算，有可能进一步降低失业救济的领取时间，限制自身食品和营养补助的范围。 全球环境也不利于美国。 从欧洲到日本，外国央行也没有多少降息空间，即使德国政府最终组建成功，德国决策者也将继续其不喜欢动用财政政策的特点。 而如果德国不利用其财政空间，其欧元区伙伴国也将没有财政空间可用。 不仅如此，帮助遏制了2008—2009年经济萎缩的国际合作已经被特朗普的“美国优先”日程毁于一旦。 “美国优先”方针将曾经的盟友列为敌人。 要想让其他国家和美国政府共同抵抗下一次衰退，唯有让它们相信它的判断和意图。 而对美国的信任度供给量严重短缺。 2008—2009年期间，美联储扩大了与外国央行的美元互换规模，但被国会抨击为“拱手送出”美国人民的辛苦钱。 接着，在2009年年初的伦敦G20峰会上，总统奥巴马政府承诺与其他政府进行财政政策协作。 在金十年后的今天，很难想象特朗普政府会在类似的会议上哪怕是露一脸。 经济扩张的长度并非下一次衰退何时到来的可靠预测指标。 而衰退的深度和性质将取决于触发衰退的事件，同样具有不确定性。 尽管如此，有一件事是笃定的，即，扩张不会永远持续下去。 风暴肯定会到来，而当它真的来临时，我们将完全没有做好应对洪水的准备。"

            "How Wright’s Law Can Right the Climate OAKLAND – As the world’s second-largest emitter of greenhouse gases, the United States is critical to preserving a livable planet. And with the recently enacted Inflation Reduction Act – which allocates hundreds of billions of dollars toward decarbonization – America has shored up its credibility just in time for the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP27) in Egypt. America is now well positioned to achieve its goal of halving its emissions by 2030, relative to 2005 levels. While the IRA’s provisions could cut US emissions up to 43% by 2030, the remaining shortfall can be covered by new Environmental Protection Agency rules and stronger state-level action of the kind that we have seen this year in California. But while the IRA is a historic achievement in its own right, its largest benefits will come in the form of global economic spillover effects. Like the European Union’s “Fit for 55” policies, the IRA will drive the deployment of solar, wind, and battery storage, thereby reducing the costs of these clean technologies for everyone. Ultimately, all countries will pay much less to cut their own emissions at the speed and scale necessary to keep climate change in check. To be sure, the US still needs to follow through on its other climate commitments, not least by providing the $11.4 billion per year (a paltry sum compared to other US expenditures) that it has pledged to finance mitigation and adaptation in the Global South. Counterintuitively, though, massive domestic investments in clean technologies by the US and the EU stand to be much more valuable than any direct financing they provide, owing to a little-known phenomenon known as Wright’s Law. Named after the US engineer who first noticed it in the 1930s (Theodore Wright), Wright’s Law predicts that every cumulative doubling of a technology’s global production will reduce its cost by a constant percentage. And as recent research at the University of Oxford confirms, solar, wind, battery, and electrolyzer costs have declined steeply as their global production has increased. But even more significantly, the researchers found that Wright’s Law holds true even after an innovative technology has achieved high levels of market maturity. That means the IRA’s $370 billion dollar investment in clean-energy production could trigger even faster cost decreases for the technologies needed to solve the climate crisis, delivering a higher quality of life for billions of people. For example, our modeling at Energy Innovation shows that these government investments could add 1,053 gigawatts of new wind and solar energy to the US grid, making it 85% clean in just eight years. Likewise, the law’s new electric-vehicle (EV) tax credits could ensure that roughly one-third of all new passenger cars and heavy-duty trucks sold in the US are electric by 2030. IRA incentives are also expected to add five gigawatts of electrolyzer capacity to produce zero-carbon hydrogen, which will be critical to cutting emissions in the chemical industry and aviation. Moreover, the IRA’s public investments will unlock several times as much private capital. Add in Europe’s investments and China’s massive push into clean energy and EVs, and annual deployment of innovative clean technologies is poised to explode. In addition to reducing emissions in the world’s largest and most highly polluting economies, the exponential growth in clean technologies will make it dramatically cheaper for the rest of the world to transform their energy systems. In fact, we have already seen this dynamic playing out. Green investments by Germany and California at the start of the last decade helped reduce the costs of solar by 85% and of wind by 56% between 2010 and 2020. Similarly, EV demand in China has helped slash battery costs by 89% since 2010. For its part, India has capitalized on these falling costs by designing clever power auctions that result in the lowest utility-scale solar-power prices in the world. As the decrease in costs accelerates, countries across the Global South will be able to exploit the benefits of Wright’s Law through bold policies to decarbonize cars, cooling, and electricity. Energy Innovation’s modeling consistently shows that ambitious clean-energy policies expand economies and create jobs, while also improving air quality. Even before the IRA, research found that India could save more than 60 trillion rupees ($752 billion) by 2050 if it adopts high-decarbonization policies. To that end, performance standards – requiring an increasing minimum share of clean power and EVs each year – are a particularly powerful instrument. In low- and middle-income countries, such policies can elegantly leverage US and EU investments at no cost to governments beyond enforcement, and can prevent a country from becoming a dumping ground for polluting vehicles and equipment. Understanding Wright’s Law can help reframe North-South dialogue at COP27. Domestic investments by the wealthiest countries will cut costs for developing countries and stretch international finance further. The less expensive climate action becomes, the greater our chances of maintaining climate stability.",
            "赖特定律如何调整气候 奥克兰—作为全世界第二大温室气体排放国，美国在保护宜居星球方面起着至关重要的作用。 随着最近颁布的降低通胀法案 — — 该法案拨款数千亿美元用于脱碳 — — 美国成功地在联合国气候变化会议（COP27）召开前提高了自己的可信度。 美国现在完全有能力实现其到2030年将排放量相较2005年水平减半的目标。 降低通胀法案条款截止2030年可以将美国的排放量降低高达43 % ， 而剩余的缺口则可以通过新的环境保护署规定和我们今年在加利福尼亚所看到的那种更强势的州级行动来弥补。 但尽管降低通胀法案本身就是一项历史成就，但其全球经济溢出效应才是最大的好处。 就像欧盟的“Fit for 55”政策一样，降低通胀法案将以促使为所有人降低清洁技术成本为目标而推动太阳能、风能和电池储能的部署。 最终，所有国家都将以低得多的成本减少其自身的排放速度和规模，从而适应控制气候变化的需求。 美国肯定仍需兑现自身的其他气候承诺，尤其是它曾承诺每年提供114亿美元，以资助全球南方的适应及财政缓和（相比美国的其他开支，这项开支的数额可谓微不足道 ） 。 但与人们的直觉相反，由于一种鲜为人知的名为赖特定律的现象，美国和欧盟在清洁技术领域的投资比之其所提供的任何直接融资都更有价值。 据以1930年代首次发现者美国工程师（西奥多·赖特）的名字命名的赖特定律预计，某项技术的全球产量累计每翻一番，均会导致其成本降低恒定的百分比。 而最近牛津大学的 研究证实，太阳能、风能、电池和电解槽的成本已随全球产量的增加而急剧下降。 但更重要的是，研究人员发现，即使在某项创新技术已达到相当高的市场成熟度之后，赖特的定律依然适用。 这就意味着，降低通胀法案3，700亿美元的清洁能源生产投资可能引发化解气候危机所需技术成本的进一步的快速下降，从而为数十亿人提供高质量的生活。 例如，我们能源创新所建立的模型显示，上述政府投资可以为美国电网增加1，053吉瓦的新增风能和太阳能，从而使其在短短8年内实现85%的清洁目标。 同样，该方案的新电动车（EV）税收抵免可以确保，截止2030年，在美国销售的约1/3的新乘用车和重型卡车约1/3为电动。 降低通胀法案的激励政策预计还将增加5吉瓦的零碳氢电解槽生产能力，而这对于化工和航空行业实现减排至关重要。 此外，降低通胀法案的公共投资将解锁数倍于投资额的私人资本。 再加上欧洲的投资和中国对清洁能源和电动车的大力推动，创新清洁能源技术的年度部署势必呈现爆炸式增长。 除降低全世界规模最大、污染最严重经济体的排放之外，清洁技术的指数级增长将导致世界其他地区能源系统转型成本的大幅下降。 事实上，我们已经亲眼目睹了这一趋势。 过去十年之初，德国和加利福尼亚的绿色投资协助在2010~2020年间将太阳能成本降低了85 % ， 风能成本降低了56 % 。 同样，中国对电动车的需求自2010年来协助将电池成本降低了89 % 。 就印度而言，该国通过设计巧妙的电力拍卖来利用上述不断下降的成本，从而享受到全世界最低的公用事业规模太阳能价格。 随着成本持续下降，全球南方国家将通过制定大胆政策来实现汽车、制冷和电力脱碳，从而充分利用赖特定律的好处。 能源创新所设立的模型始终表明，雄心勃勃的清洁能源政策可以在扩大经济并创造就业岗位的同时改善空气质量。 即使在降低通胀法案出台前，研究结果显示截止到2050年，印度可以节约超过60万亿卢比（合7520亿美元 ） ， 如果它采用高脱碳率的政策。 为实现这一目标，要求每年增加清洁能源和电动汽车最低份额的绩效标准是一种尤其强大的政策。 在低收入和中等收入国家，上述政策可以巧妙的利用美国和欧洲的投资，政府除政策执行外无需付出任何代价，同时还可以防止一个国家成为污染车辆和设备的清倒场。 理解赖特定律有助于重新构建联合国气候变化框架公约第27次缔约方大会的北南对话。 最富裕国家的国内投资将降低发展中国家成本，同时进一步扩大国际融资规模。 气候行动成本越低，我们维持气候稳定的几率也就越大。"

            "The Leader the WTO Needs LONDON – With the global trading system under severe pressure, international cooperation to strengthen a rules-based order is vital. Now, perhaps more than ever, we need a World Trade Organization that supports economic recovery, defends multilateralism, rebuilds trust, and rises to the twenty-first-century challenges posed by poverty, inequality, climate change, and – more immediately – the COVID-19 pandemic. We write as representatives of non-government organizations, philanthropists, and business leaders united in our conviction that Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala is uniquely well placed to lead the WTO into a critical new era. It is all too easy to lose sight of why trade matters to ordinary people around the world. Aid plays a critical role in advancing human development. But it is through trade and markets, from local to global, that people work their way out of poverty and countries create jobs, build prosperity, and seize business opportunities. In our interdependent world, an open multilateral trading system overseen by the WTO can benefit all countries. For the world’s poorest countries, trade offers a route to higher value-added production. Managed effectively, and linked to strategies for inclusive growth, international trade can help realize the ambition of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to eradicate poverty and build shared prosperity. With the world teetering on the brink of historic reversals of hard-won progress on reducing extreme poverty and malnutrition, combating child mortality, and extending educational opportunity, we need a trading system that works for the poor. Okonjo-Iweala is well placed to work with governments to build that system. The hallmark of her career has been an unwavering commitment to poverty reduction, marginalized people, and gender equity. Under her leadership, the WTO would be a force driving progress toward the SDGs. Beyond poverty, international trade matters for a raft of global goals for 2030. What happens through the trading system has a profound impact on the environment. The climate crisis, biodiversity loss, unsustainable use of natural resources, and pollution of the land, sea, and air point to a single overwhelming conclusion: business as usual is not an option. The scale and intensity of these challenges pose a direct threat to livelihoods, food systems, and human health. Effective multilateral rules could help steer the world away from an ecological collision course with our planetary boundaries. The WTO could play a critical role in decarbonizing growth, protecting biodiversity, and managing pollution. Our success – or failure – in rising to this century’s great ecological challenges will define how future generations look back at us and our political leaders. There is also an enormous prize at stake: New business opportunities linked to a more sustainable global economy could reach $12 trillion per year or more by 2030, implying more jobs and greater prosperity. Outcomes will depend in part on whether countries are able to come together through the WTO. While trade may seem far removed from the urgent challenges posed by COVID-19, the pandemic has demonstrated our shared vulnerability and interdependence. It has also highlighted the ways in which trade can support public health. Trade in protective equipment, testing kits, and medicines has helped save lives. Looking ahead, overcoming the pandemic will require not just vaccines, but their equitable distribution worldwide. We need to act as a single global community in protecting health. But without effective and equitable trade rules, supply chains can be disrupted, vulnerable people can be denied access to treatment, and entire countries can miss out on access to vaccines. None of the benefits of trade are automatic. That is why the WTO needs a director-general equipped to work across political divides, build bridges, and find practical solutions. In short, it needs a leader who can work with governments, helping them rise above their differences to find common ground. We believe that Okonjo-Iweala is uniquely well placed to play that role. As a highly respected development economist, she has consistently highlighted the crucial role of trade in building a path to shared prosperity. Moreover, trade has figured prominently in her portfolio. During her 25 years at the World Bank, Okonjo-Iweala worked on economic policy, including the trade challenges facing developing countries in all regions. As Nigeria’s finance minister, and its first-ever coordinating minister of the economy, she oversaw the critical intersection of trade and investment with other productive sectors, and she participated in the reform of national and sub-regional trade. Moreover, Okonjo-Iweala has a distinguished track record as an effective reformer. As Managing Director at the World Bank, she negotiated a wide range of development finance initiatives. In Nigeria, she led major financial reforms and championed transparency. Her deft handling of complex deals on debt relief demonstrated an ability to navigate a practical pathway to solutions. Okonjo-Iweala has impressive credentials on health and the environment as well. She currently chairs Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, a public-private partnership that has saved millions of lives. In that role, she has been one of the architects of the path breaking COVAX facility, which has now attracted over $1.7 billion in support to ensure equitable and affordable access to vaccines for poorer countries. She also co-chairs the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate. As a seasoned policymaker, Okonjo-Iweala has the skills and experience to engage governments and other stakeholders. All countries – rich and poor – stand to gain from an effectively managed trading system that puts shared interests first. We believe in the WTO, and we want to see it led by a director-general who can galvanize action and deliver results not just for the most powerful economies, but also for the world’s poorest countries and the people who have been left behind. Okonjo-Iweala is the right candidate for the job.

            "位WTO急需的领导人 发自伦敦—在全球贸易体系遭遇极大压力之时，加强一个基于规则秩序的国际合作就变得至关重要。 而这一点在当前的重要性或许还要高于以往任何时候，因此我们需要一个能支撑经济复苏，捍卫多边主义，重建信任并应对由贫困、不平等，气候变化以及（更迫切的）新型冠状病毒所带来的二十世纪挑战的世界贸易组织（WTO ） 。 为此我们以非政府组织，慈善家和商业领袖代表的身份共同撰文，认定恩戈齐·奥孔乔-伊韦阿拉（Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala）具备独特的优势去带领世贸组织迈入一个至关重要的新时代。 人们总是很容易忽略贸易对世界各地普通民众的重要性。 虽然援助在推动人类发展中发挥着至关重要的作用，但正是借助从地方到全球的贸易和市场人们才得以摆脱贫困，各国才能创造就业机会，建立繁荣并抓住商机。 在我们这个相互依存的世界中，世贸组织监督下的开放多边贸易体系能使所有国家受益。 对于那些世界上最贫穷的国家而言，贸易为实现更高附加值的生产提供了一条路径。 如果能得到有效管理并与包容性增长战略联系起来，国际贸易就可以协助实现联合国可持续发展目标消除贫困和建立共同繁荣的宏大构想。 而鉴于世界当前可能在减少极端贫困和营养不良，降低儿童死亡率和扩大受教育机会等来之不易的进步上出现历史性倒退，我们需要一个能为穷人服务的贸易体系。 奥孔乔-伊韦阿拉非常适合与政府合作去构建该体系。 她的职业生涯展现了其对减贫，保障边缘群体权益和性别平等的坚定承诺。 相信世贸组织会在她的领导下成为推动朝向可持续发展目标迈进的一股力量。 除了与贫穷的斗争之外，国际贸易对一众2030年全球目标也非常重要。 通过贸易体系发生的事件会对环境产生深远影响。 气候危机、生物多样性丧失、自然资源不可持续利用以及对土地，海洋和空气的污染都指向了一个压倒性的结论 ： “ 老办法”是不可行的。 这些大规模高强度的挑战都对人们的生计，粮食体系和人类健康构成了直接威胁。 有效的多边规则可以帮助使世界摆脱与我们地球生态红线（planetary boundary）的生态碰撞进程。 世贸组织可以在增长减碳，生物多样性保护和污染管理方面发挥关键作用。 而在应对本世纪巨大生态挑战方面的成败将决定子孙后代对我们以及我们的政治领导人的观感。 在此还涉及一个巨大的机遇：与更可持续全球经济相关的新商机可能会在2030年时达到12万亿美元（甚至更多 ） ， 这意味着更多的就业机会和更大的繁荣。 而最终成果将在某种程度上取决于各国是否能够通过世贸组织联合到一起。 尽管贸易似乎与新型冠状病毒引发的紧迫挑战不太相关，但这一疫情揭示了我们共同具备的脆弱性和相互依存关系。 此外它还凸显了贸易支援公共卫生的各类手段，防护设备，检测试剂盒和药品的贸易也协助挽救了无数生命。 展望未来，克服这一疫情不仅需要疫苗，还需要在全球范围内对其进行公平分配。 我们需要组建一个单一全球社区去行动起来捍卫健康。 但如果缺乏有效和公平的贸易规则，供应链可能会被切断，弱势人群可能无法获得治疗，整个国家都可能无法获取疫苗。 但所有这些贸易上的好处都不是坐等而来的，而这也是世贸组织需要一位有能力跨越政治分歧，架设沟通桥梁并找到切实可行解决方案的总干事的原因。 简而言之，它需要一个能够与各国政府合作超越分歧并找到共同点的领导者。 我们认为恩戈齐·奥孔乔-伊韦阿拉尤其适合扮演上述角色。 作为一位备受推崇的发展经济学家，她一直强调贸易在构建共同繁荣之路中的关键作用。 此外贸易在她的简历中也占据了重要地位。 她在世界银行任职的25年中致力于经济政策，包括应对各地区发展中国家所面临的贸易挑战。 作为尼日利亚财政部长以及该国首任经济协调部长，她管控着贸易和投资与其他生产部门之间的关键交汇点，并参与了国家和次区域贸易的改革。 此外，奥孔乔-伊韦阿拉也是一位有着出色纪录的高效改革者。 她在担任世界银行常务副行长的时候就参与谈判了一系列发展融资计划。 在尼日利亚，她领导了重大的金融改革并倡导提升透明度。 她在处理复杂债务减免协议时展现了的熟练手腕展现了自身寻找切实解决方案的能力。 奥孔乔-伊韦阿拉在健康和环境方面也拥有令人印象深刻的履历。 她目前是全球疫苗免疫联盟的主席，这个通过公私合作伙伴关系构建的联盟已经挽救了数百万人的生命。 在担任该职务期间，她成为了突破性的“新冠疫苗肺炎实施计划 ” （ COVAX）的其中一位建构者，而该计划现已吸引了超过17亿美元的支持以确保较贫穷国家能够公平且廉价地获得疫苗。 她还是全球经济与气候委员会的联合主席。 作为一位久经考验的政策制定者，奥孔乔-伊韦阿拉具有与政府和其他利益相关者互动的技能和经验。 不论贫穷还是富有，所有国家都将从一个高效管理并将将共同利益置于首位的贸易体系中受益。 我们相信世贸组织，也希望它能拥有一位不仅服务于那些世界上最强大的经济体，还能为世界上最贫穷国家和被遗忘民众奋起行动并取得成果的总干事，而奥孔乔-伊韦阿拉就是该职位的合适人选。 本文得到以下人士联署：K·Y·阿莫阿科，非洲经济转型研究中心创始人兼总裁；波诺，ONE Campaign项目联合创始人；阿利科·丹哥特，Dangote集团创始人，董事长兼首席执行官；娜塔莉·德拉帕尔默，莫·伊卜拉欣基金会CEO；占米·德兰蒙德GlobalGoals.org全球策略师；卡洛琳·肯德-罗布，国际关怀协会前秘书长，非洲进步小组执行董事；雷切尔·凯特，美国塔夫茨大学弗莱彻学院院长；斯泰夫·马斯伊瓦， Econet集团执行主席兼创始人；基里什·梅农，英国ActionAid首席执行官；桑杰·普拉德翰，开放政府伙伴关系组织首席执行官；盖尔·史密夫，ONE Campaign项目首席执行官；贾斯丁·范弗利特，Theirworld组织总裁兼全球商业教育联合会执行董事； 祖埃拉·尤素福，Aliko Dangote基金会常务董事兼首席执行官以及蒂姆·温莱特，WaterAid组织首席执行官。"

            "Will the Ukraine War Revive the WTO? WASHINGTON, DC – Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has heightened everyone’s appreciation of global issues and interconnectivity. In addition to geopolitical and defense concerns, there is a renewed focus on the state of international trade. After continuing Donald Trump’s destructive trade policies for more than a year, US President Joe Biden’s administration finally appears to have recognized the importance of strong trade relations. The United States is holding consultations with the European Union to expand cooperation on trade and technology, and with others on issues such as agriculture. A big opportunity to reverse Trump’s legacy comes in June, when trade ministers from 164 member states and 25 observer countries will meet in Geneva for the 12th Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organization. The meeting cannot come soon enough. The world economy desperately needs the WTO to be restored so that it can play the valuable role that it did before the Trump presidency. It is thanks to the WTO and its predecessor, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, that the open multilateral trading system was so successful for 70 years after World War II. To its great credit, the US led the world in creating the institution and supporting its development. Member states agreed to subject their trade policies to the rule of law, which in turn allowed traders to engage in international exchange with confidence. The essential WTO principles are threefold. Countries should not discriminate among other WTO members in administering their trade policies. Governments should treat foreign nationals and entities within their jurisdiction the same as domestic firms. And all member states should maintain open trade policies, except in special circumstances. The WTO has adopted important additional protocols on such matters as trade in information technology products, agricultural trade, standardization of customs forms, and so forth. Equally important, it long served as the forum for settling trade disputes between countries. If an exporter claimed that its treatment in an importing country violated WTO rules, the WTO had procedures to address the charge. In fact, the WTO’s dispute settlement mechanism (DSM) was widely regarded as one of its most successful functions. In the event of a complaint, the WTO would notify the complainant’s trading partner and set a timeframe for direct negotiations. If there was no satisfactory resolution, a panel was appointed to hear the case and present its findings. If the defending country was found to have violated WTO rules, it could either alter its behavior or appeal to the Appellate Body, whose seven members were nominated by the WTO membership by unanimous consent for four-year terms. The Appellate Body’s ruling was then binding on the parties. But things changed when the Trump administration assumed office early in 2017. In addition to imposing tariffs on steel, aluminum, and other goods (many on dubious national-security grounds), demanding a renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement and other trade agreements, and instigating a trade war with China, the US refused to approve any new appointments to the Appellate Body. As a result, the DSM – the “jewel in the crown” of the WTO – now has no members and is defunct. In its absence, a group of 25 WTO member states and the WTO leadership has agreed to a Multi-Party Interim Appeal Arbitration Arrangement (MPIA), which will follow a process very much like the DSM. If the Biden administration is serious about correcting its predecessor’s mistakes, it could use the June ministerial meeting to join the MPIA agreement and start negotiating a new statement of fundamental principles. Once agreed, this could allow for a full restoration of a binding DSM and more clear-cut criteria for determining national-security carve-outs, regulating trade in health-care products and e-commerce, and tackling environmental issues. Although essential WTO principles like non-discrimination are highly desirable, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine represents an obvious exception. Such aggression warrants sanctions both to handicap Russian military activities and to ensure supplies for the coalition supporting Ukraine. In April, US Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen declared that the US and its allies must not “allow countries to use their market position in key raw materials, technologies, or products to have the power to disrupt our economy or exercise unwanted geopolitical leverage.” Arguing that US trading arrangements should favor “friend-shoring,” she said the US would now consider “building a network of plurilateral trade arrangements to incorporate elements of the modern economy.” But since it is equally important to preserve the open trading system, this new principle of trade policy will need to be carefully defined. There is a risk that those with purely protectionist motives will benefit under the friend-shoring rubric, and there are questions about the criteria for “friends.” What if a “friendly” country replaces its government with one that is hostile to the US? What if a producer in a friendly country uses imported inputs from a non-friendly country? The friend-shoring doctrine needs to be clarified, lest it end up discouraging supply chains and other trading relationships that would greatly benefit trading partners. If friend-shoring can be made consistent with an open multilateral trading system and WTO rules (perhaps with a clear, minimal carve-out for trade with non-friends), it will resolve a thorny public policy issue. While the details of the new principle are being addressed, however, efforts to advance the MPIA and an eventual restoration of the DSM should be pursued in earnest.",
            "乌克兰能让世贸组织复兴吗？ 华盛顿—俄罗斯对乌克兰的入侵提高了每个人对全球问题和联动性的认识。 除了地缘政治和国防问题外，人们重新关注国际贸易状况。 在延续特朗普的破坏性贸易政策一年多之后，美国总统拜登政府似乎终于认识到了牢固的贸易关系的重要性。 美国正在与欧盟进行磋商扩大贸易和技术方面的合作，与其他国家磋商农业等问题。 扭转特朗普遗产的大好机会在6 月，届时， 164 个成员国和 25 个观察员国的贸易部长将在日内瓦举行世界贸易组织第 12 届部长级会议。 这次会议可谓正逢其时。 世界经济迫切需要复兴世贸组织，让它发挥特朗普担任总统之前所发挥的宝贵作用。 正是由于世贸组织及其前身《关税与贸易总协定 》 ， 开放的多边贸易体制在二战后的70年里大获成功。 美国居功甚伟，领导世界创立了它并支持它的发展。 成员国同意让其贸易受法治约束，这反过来又使贸易商能够充满信心地参与国际交换。 世贸组织的基本原则有三个方面。 各国在管理其贸易政策时不应歧视其他世贸组织成员。 政府应将对管辖范围内的外国国民和实体与国内企业一视同仁。 除特殊情况外，所有成员国都应保持开放的贸易政策。 世贸组织就信息技术产品贸易、农产品贸易、海关形式标准化等事项通过了重要的附加协议。 同样重要的是，它长期以来一直也是解决国家间贸易争端的论坛。 如果出口国声称其在进口国的待遇违反了世贸组织规则，那么世贸组织自有程序来处理这一指控。 事实上，世贸组织的争端解决机制（DSM）被广泛认为是其最成功的职能之一。 如果发生投诉，世贸组织将通知投诉人的贸易伙伴，并设定直接谈判的时间框架。 如果没有令人满意的解决方案，则会任命一个小组来审理此案并公布调查结果。 如果发现辩方国违反了世贸组织规则，它可以改变其行为或向上诉机构提出上诉。 上诉机构的七名成员由世贸组织成员一致同意，任期四年。 上诉机构的裁决做出后对各方具有约束力。 但当特朗普政府在 2017 年初上任时，情况发生了变化。 美国对钢铁、铝和其他商品征收关税（许多是出于可疑的国家安全理由 ） ， 还要求重新谈判北美自由贸易协定和其他贸易协定，并挑起与中国的贸易战，此外还拒绝批准上诉机构的任何新任命。 结果，DSM — — 世贸组织“皇冠上的明珠 ” — —现在已无成员，形同虚设。 在DSM缺席的情况下，由 25 个世贸组织成员国和 世贸组织领导层组成的小组已同意了多方临时上诉仲裁安排 (MPIA ) ， 并将遵循非常类似于 DSM 的程序。 如果拜登政府认真纠正其前任的错误，它可以利用 6 月的部长级会议加入 MPIA 协议，并开始协商新的基本原则声明。 一旦达成一致，将全面恢复有约束力的 DSM 和更明确的标准，以确定国家安全例外情况、规范医疗保健产品和电子商务贸易以及解决环境问题。 尽管无歧视等重要 WTO 原则非常需要，但俄罗斯入侵乌克兰是一个明显的例外。 这种侵略需要制裁，以阻碍俄罗斯的军事活动，确保为支持乌克兰的联盟提供物资。 4 月，美国财政部长珍妮特·耶伦（Janet Yellen）宣布，美国及其盟国不得“允许各国利用其在关键原材料、技术或产品方面的市场地位破坏我们的经济或行使不合适的地缘政治影响力 。 ” 她认为，美国的贸易安排应该有利于“朋友支持 ” （ friend-shoring ） ， 她说美国现在将考虑“建立一个多边贸易安排网络，纳入现代经济要素 。 ” 但由于维护开放的贸易体系同样重要，因此需要仔细定义这一新的贸易政策原则。 存在一种风险，即纯粹出于保护主义动机的人有可能会在朋友支持政策下受益，而且对于“朋友”的标准也存在疑问。 如果一个“友好”的国家的政府被敌视美国的政府取而代之呢？ 如果友好国家的生产商使用从不友好国家进口的投入品呢？ 朋友支持原则需要澄清，以免它最终阻碍供应链和其他大大有利于贸易伙伴的贸易关系。 如果朋友支持能够与开放的多边贸易体系和 世贸组织 规则相一致（也许存在针对非朋友贸易的明确的、最小的例外 ） ， 它将解决一个棘手的公共政策问题。 然而，虽然新原则的细节正在得到解决，仍需大力推进 MPIA 并最终恢复 DSM。"

            "A Golden Opportunity to End Destructive Fishing Subsidies GENEVA – It is not often that trade negotiators get a chance simultaneously to protect vulnerable people and their livelihoods, promote healthier oceans, and fulfill one of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. But that is exactly the opportunity awaiting trade ministers as they gather at the World Trade Organization this week to discuss new global rules limiting government support for the fishing industry. These public subsidies incentivize overfishing, and WTO members have been debating how to limit them for 20 years now. During those long two decades, global fish stocks have decreased sharply, and poor and vulnerable artisanal fishers have suffered along with ocean ecosystems. In 2017, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) warned that an estimated one-third of global fish stocks were overfished, an increase from 10% in 1970 and 27% in 2000. The depletion of fish stocks threatens the food security of low-income coastal communities and the livelihoods of poor and vulnerable fishers, who must travel farther and farther from shore only to bring back smaller and smaller hauls. Despite these disturbing findings, governments continue to disburse around $35 billion in annual fisheries subsidies, two-thirds of which go to commercial fishers. In doing so, they are keeping at sea many commercial vessels that would otherwise be economically unviable. World leaders recognized the seriousness of the problem back in 2015 when they agreed to forge an agreement on fisheries subsidies by 2020 as part of the Sustainable Development Agenda. But while trade ministers reaffirmed this pledge in 2017, talks at the WTO have repeatedly stalled. Over the past year, however, things have begun to turn around. Political leaders and trade ministers from around the world tell me they want to get an agreement done this year. In Geneva, the chair of these negotiations, Ambassador Santiago Wills of Colombia, has worked with WTO members to draft a negotiating text that I believe can provide the foundation for final-stage talks. But despite the political support voiced by government leaders, important divisions persist. Indeed, as matters stand, we are in danger of failing to conclude a deal before the WTO’s year-end Ministerial Conference. This tight timetable is the reason for convening trade ministers this month. While no one expects a miracle, the meeting represents a golden opportunity to bring the negotiations within striking distance of a deal. WTO members need to conclude an agreement in time for the UN Biodiversity Conference in October, and no later than the end of November, when the WTO’s own ministerial begins. A failure to do so would jeopardize the ocean’s biodiversity and the sustainability of the fish stocks on which so many depend for food and income. Yes, the talks are complex, because fish do not inhabit a single national territory or observe maritime boundaries. WTO negotiators must account for both the existing framework of international fisheries rules and the role of the regulatory bodies that govern many aspects of fishing around the world. They also must define how new subsidy rules would apply to far-flung fishing vessels. Compounding the challenge is the fact that the WTO is not a fisheries management organization. Still, the WTO has a longstanding framework of rules that curb trade-distorting subsidies for industrial and agricultural goods. That is why trade ministers agreed back in 2001 to come up with similar measures to protect marine fisheries. Although there is still work to do, the current draft negotiating text would make an important contribution to the sustainability of our oceans. For starters, it would completely ban government funding for vessels that engage in illegal fishing. According to the FAO, these activities account for 11-26 million tons of fish per year, or roughly 20% of the total global catch. The agreement would also rein in other types of subsidies that support increased fishing activity, by requiring that governments prove they have taken steps to ensure such support does not harm fish stocks. One of the toughest issues in the negotiations is how to define and honor the original negotiating mandate guaranteeing special and differential treatment for developing countries – and especially for least-developed countries. Many of these countries rely on small-scale artisanal fishing, and they are seeking more policy space to develop their industrial fishing capabilities. But, because their fisheries management capacity is weak, they may struggle to implement new subsidy regimes as quickly and effectively as better-off members can. Another tough issue is to ensure transparency, with requirements that a member offer notification when deploying non-harmful and non-distortionary subsidies to encourage its fishing industry. Tackling these issues will not be easy, but tackle them we must, because WTO members have pledged to protect the fisheries and ocean we all share. By negotiating away harmful fisheries subsidies, WTO members will not just be honoring past commitments. They will also be lending momentum to other international efforts to address problems in the global commons – from climate change to the COVID-19 pandemic. Let’s hope that the world’s trade ministers rise to the challenge.",
            "一个终结破坏性渔业补贴的黄金机遇 发自日内瓦—贸易谈判者甚少有机会一次满足保护弱势群体及其生计、提升海洋健康度和实现其中一个联合国可持续发展目标这三个愿望。 但对于本周齐聚世界贸易组织讨论全球限制政府支持渔业新规则的各国贸易部长来说，有这么一个机遇正在等待着他们。 政府发放的公共补贴刺激了过度捕捞，而世贸组织成员在如何限制这些补贴方面已经辩论了20年。 在这漫长的20年间全球鱼类资源急剧减少，贫穷脆弱的传统渔民与海洋生态系统则一同遭到了冲击。 2017年联合国粮食及农业组织警告说约有1/3的全球鱼类资源被过度捕捞，相对于1970年的10%和2000年的27%更为恶化。 鱼类资源的枯竭威胁着沿海低收入社区的粮食安全以及贫穷脆弱渔民的生计，他们被迫前往离岸越来越远的海域打鱼，却只能带回越来越小的渔获。 尽管存在这些令人不安的发现，但各国政府依然在支付每年约350亿美元的渔业补贴，而其中2/3都落到了商业捕捞者手里。 这样一来，许多本应入不敷出的商业捕捞渔船都被保留了下来。 世界各国领导人早在2015年就认识到了问题的严重性，当时他们同意在2020年前就渔业补贴达成协议并将其作为可持续发展议程的一部分。 但尽管贸易部长们在2017年重申了这一承诺，世贸组织的谈判却一再陷入僵局。 但在过去一年间事情已经开始出现转机，来自世界各地的政治领导人和贸易部长都跟我说他们有意在今年达成一项协议。 在日内瓦，担任此类谈判主席的哥伦比亚驻世贸组织大使圣地亚哥·威尔斯（Santiago Wills）已经与世贸组织各成员合作起草了一份相信可以为最后阶段谈判定调的谈判文本。 但尽管各政府领导人都在政治上表达了支持，重要的分歧却依然存在。 事实上就目前情况而言，我们很可能在年底的世贸组织部长级会议召开前都无法达成协议。 这个紧迫的时间表就是本月将贸易部长们召来开会的原因。 虽然没有人会指望奇迹发生，但这次会议代表着一个使谈判向达成协议大幅靠拢的黄金契机。 世贸组织成员需要在10月的联合国生物多样性大会召开前及时达成协议，且不得迟于11月底世贸组织自己的部长级会议开始之时。 如果做不到这一点，那么海洋生物多样性和许多人赖以生存的鱼类资源的可持续性就将继续恶化下去。 谈判无疑是相当复杂的，因为鱼类不居住在任何国家的领土上，也不会遵守海洋边界。 世贸组织的谈判者必须顾及到现行国际渔业规则框架和那些管理着世界各地多方面渔业的监管机构所扮演的角色，还必须确定新的补贴规则将如何适用于远洋渔船。 使挑战更为复杂的是世贸组织并不是一个渔业管理组织。 不过世贸组织一直拥有一个旨在遏制对工业/农业产品的扭曲性贸易补贴的规则框架。 这也是贸易部长们早在2001年就同意拿出类似措施来保护海洋渔业的原因。 尽管仍有许多工作要做，但目前的谈判文本草案将为我们海洋的可持续性做出重要贡献。 首先它会完全禁止政府资助那些非法捕捞船只。 根据联合国粮农组织的数据，这类船只每年产出1100~2600万吨鱼获，约占全球总产量的20 % 。 该协议还将控制推动捕鱼活动的其他类型补贴，并要求政府证明自身已采取相关措施确保这类支持不会损害鱼类资源。 而谈判中的其中一个最棘手问题就如何定义和履行最初的谈判目的，那就是保证对发展中国家，特别是最不发达国家的特殊和差别待遇。 许多这类国家都依赖小规模的传统捕鱼，也在寻求更多的政策空间来发展自身工业捕鱼能力。 但由于渔业管理能力薄弱，它们可能难以像较富裕的成员国那样迅速有效地执行新的补贴制度。 另一个棘手的问题则是确保透明度，要求成员在发放非伤害性和非扭曲性补贴以鼓励其渔业时进行公告。 虽然解决这些问题都不容易，但我们必须解决，因为世贸组织成员已承诺保护人类共同拥有的渔业资源和海洋。 通过谈判取消有破坏性的渔业补贴，世贸组织成员不仅能履行过去的承诺，还将为其他国际努力提供动力以解决从气候变化到新冠疫情的各类全球公域问题。 我们希望世界上的贸易部长们能够挺身而出迎接这一挑战。"

            "The WTO Is Back GENEVA – As a beautiful dawn crept over Lake Geneva on June 17, a remarkable thing happened at the World Trade Organization’s headquarters. After nearly six days of negotiations at the WTO’s 12th Ministerial Conference – culminating in a marathon 48 hours of non-stop talks – ministers and senior officials from the body’s 164 member states adopted a historic package of agreements. The multilateral deals – of a scale and scope that the WTO has not achieved since the mid-1990s – will help people, businesses, and the planet. For example, ministers struck a compromise on a long-debated proposal to waive intellectual-property protections related to COVID-19 countermeasures. Current COVID-19 vaccine supplies remain heavily dependent on the four WTO members that together account for over 90% of exported doses. As the pandemic has shown, many import-dependent regions are vulnerable to export restrictions introduced by other countries in the face of domestic crises. Governments at the center of the negotiations believe that the outcome – which has been criticized by public-health activists for doing too little and by pharmaceutical firms for going too far – will contribute to ongoing efforts to deconcentrate and diversify vaccine manufacturing capacity. This is significant for the future resilience of global vaccine supplies. Ministers also pledged to keep cross-border trade in medical supplies and components open and transparent, which will help members to gain better access to products needed to fight this pandemic – and to prepare better for the next one. Next, the new agreement on fisheries subsidies – finally concluded after nearly 21 years of negotiations – will curb the estimated $22 billion in annual government support that contributes to the depletion of marine resources. By banning subsidies that contribute to illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing, as well as fishing in the high seas and in overfished stocks, the pact represents a major step forward in protecting ocean health. The agreement – the first in WTO history with a primarily environmental objective at its core – also launches a second wave of negotiations to enhance the new rules on sustainability, including by further disciplining support for overcapacity and overfishing. With the world confronting the worst food-security crisis in decades, WTO members pledged to make trade in food and agricultural inputs more predictable, which will help to make prices less volatile. They adopted a long-standing proposal to help the World Food Programme by ensuring that national export restrictions do not bar the United Nations agency from accessing supplies for the humanitarian relief it provides to millions of people in regions hit by war and natural disasters. WFP Executive Director David Beasley tweeted that “this humanitarian exemption saves time, [money], and ensures critical relief reaches the most vulnerable.” WTO members also preserved predictability in the global digital economy by extending a long-established moratorium on levying customs duties on cross-border electronic transmissions. The decision is good news for consumers of streamed movies and video games, and better news for the millions of small and medium-size firms that rely on digital services and markets. In addition, WTO members initiated a process of institutional reform, acknowledging that the organization needs to update and improve the way it operates. They committed to making the WTO’s dispute-settlement system fully functional again within two years. And, importantly, they recognized the role that trade and the WTO can play in empowering women, expanding opportunities for micro, small, and medium-size enterprises, and achieving global environmental goals. Following the conference, one headline proclaimed that “A New Dawn Breaks for the Global Trading Order.” But success was hardly foreordained. All but a few previous WTO ministerial meetings had delivered little or broke down in acrimony. Many observers saw little chance of anything different happening this time, particularly given the backdrop of rising geopolitical tensions and the war in Ukraine. And yet, the consensus in Geneva was joined by every WTO member, including Ukraine, Russia, the United States, China, the European Union and its member states, Australia, Brazil, India, Pakistan, South Africa, and Caribbean and Pacific island states. This was multilateralism at its best. Members rose above bilateral tensions and chose to invest in the multilateral trading system that for decades has underpinned expanding global trade and prosperity. The agreements have put the WTO back on track as a results-oriented organization. They demonstrate that multilateral negotiations – which until recently were increasingly described as moribund – can still deliver, provided members overcome decades of distrust and work together. Amid all the talk of decoupling and deglobalization, governments have renewed faith in the ability of multilateral rules to continue anchoring trade between countries and blocs. That will make it possible to avoid the heavy costs of far-reaching economic fragmentation. Strategic rivalries will of course persist. But the kind of strategic cooperation across geopolitical fault lines that was evident in Geneva will be necessary, in trade and other domains, if we are to solve problems of the global commons, from climate change to pandemic preparedness. The measures adopted by the 600-odd bleary-eyed delegates in the WTO’s main conference room lay a foundation for members to rebuild trust, reach further agreements, and advance much-needed institutional reforms to keep the organization fit for purpose. The goal must be to continue delivering results for people around the world. I am confident that this brick-by-brick approach will establish a solid foundation to support a reinvigorated WTO well into the future.",
            "世贸组织归来 日内瓦—6月17日，美丽的黎明日内瓦湖升起，世界贸易组织总部发生了一件了不起的事情。 在世贸组织第 12 届部长级会议上，经过近 6 天的谈判 — — 在一次马拉松式的 48 小时不间断的会谈中达到顶点 — — 该机构 164 个成员国的部长和高级官员通过了具有历史意义的一揽子协议。 这组多边协议 — — 其规模和范围是 世贸组织 自 1990 年代中期以来从未实现过的 — — 将惠及人类、企业和地球。 例如，部长们就一项长期争论不休的提案达成妥协，放弃与新冠对策相关的知识产权保护。 当前新冠 疫苗供应仍然严重依赖四个 世贸组织 成员，它们合计占出口剂量的 90% 以上。 这场大流行表明，许多依赖进口的地区在面临国内危机时容易受到其他国家实施的出口限制的影响。 处于谈判中心的政府认为，这一结果 — — 被公共卫生活动家批评做得太少，被制药公司批评走得太远 — — 将有助于当下分散和多元化疫苗生产能力的措施。 这对于全球疫苗供应的未来韧性具有重要意义。 部长们还承诺保持医疗用品和零部件跨境贸易公开透明，这有助于成员国更好地获得抗击这场大流行所需的产品，并为下一次大流行做好准备。 接下来，经过近 21 年的谈判最终达成的新渔业补贴协议将削减每年大约 220 亿美元的政府支持，这些支持导致了海洋资源枯竭。 通过禁止对非法、未报告和无管制捕捞进行补贴，以及禁止对在公海和过度捕捞种群进行的捕捞给予补贴，该协议在保护海洋健康方面向前迈出了重要一步。 该协议是 世贸组织 历史上第一个以环境目标为核心的协议，它还启动了强化可持续性新规则的第二波谈判，包括进一步约束对过剩产能和过度捕捞的支持。 世界正面临几十年来最严重的粮食安全危机，世贸组织成员承诺让粮食和农业投入品贸易更加可预测，这有助于降低价格波动。 他们通过了一项帮助世界粮食计划署的长期建议，确保国家出口限制不会阻止联合国机构获得人道主义救济物资，从而向遭受战争和自然灾害地区的数百万人提供人道主义救济。 世界粮食计划署执行主任戴维·比斯利（David Beasley）在推特上说 ： “ 这种人道主义豁免可以节省时间和[金钱 ] ， 并确保最脆弱的人能够获得重要的救济 。 ” 世贸组织成员还延长了长期以来对跨境电子传输征收关税的暂停期，保护了全球数字经济的可预测性。 这一决定对流媒体电影和视频游戏的消费者来说是个好消息，对数百万依赖数字服务和市场的中小型公司来说也是如此。 此外，世贸组织成员启动了体制改革进程，承认该组织需要更新和改进其运作方式。 他们承诺在两年内让世贸组织的争端解决机制再次全面运作。 而且重要的是，他们认识到贸易和世贸组织在妇女赋能、扩大中小微企业机会以及实现全球环境目标方面可以发挥的作用。 会议结束后，一则新闻宣称“全球贸易秩序迎来新曙光 ” 。 但成功并不是注定的。 此前的世贸组织部长级会议大都没有取得什么成果，或者在激烈的争吵中破裂。 许多观察家认为这次会有不同的可能性很小，特别是考虑到地缘政治紧张局势升级和乌克兰战争的背景。 然而，每个 世贸组织 成员都加入了日内瓦的共识，包括乌克兰、俄罗斯、美国、中国、欧盟及其成员国、澳大利亚、巴西、印度、巴基斯坦、南非以及加勒比和太平洋岛国。 这是最好的多边主义。 成员们超脱了双边紧张，选择投资于几十年来一直支撑着全球贸易和繁荣的多边贸易体系。 这些协议使世贸组织重回一个以结果为导向的组织的正轨。 它们表明，多边谈判 — — 直到最近越来越多的人认为纯属垂死挣扎 — — 仍然可以实现，只要成员克服数十年的不信任并共同努力。 在脱钩论和去全球化日嚣尘上之际，各国政府重新相信多边规则能够继续锚定国家和区域之间的贸易。 这有可能避免深度经济分裂带来的沉重代价。 战略竞争当然会持续下去。 但是，如果我们要解决从气候变化到大流行防范的全球公域问题，那么在日内瓦看到的跨越地缘政治断层线的战略合作是必不可少的，不管是在贸易还是在其他领域。 世贸组织主会议室的 600 多名睡眼惺忪的代表所采取的措施为成员重建信任、达成进一步协议和推进急需的体制改革以保持该组织的目标发挥作用奠定了基础。 目标必须是继续为世界各地的人们带来成果。 我相信，这一步步为营的做法将为未来重振世贸组织奠定坚实的基础。"

            "Reeling in a Deal to Save the Ocean AUCKLAND/MADRID/VICTORIA/ANSE ROYALE – The ocean covers more than 70% of our planet’s surface, produces half of the oxygen we breathe, feeds billions of people, and provides hundreds of millions of jobs. It also plays a major role in mitigating climate change: over 80% of the global carbon cycle passes through the ocean. But this precious natural resource is not invincible. Despite all the benefits it affords us, the ocean today faces unprecedented man-made crises that threaten its health and its ability to sustain life on Earth. The greatest threat to marine biodiversity is overfishing. More than one-third of global fish stocks are overfished and a further 60% are fully fished. Each year, governments around the world encourage overfishing by providing $22 billion in harmful fisheries subsidies. Although these subsidies are designed to help support coastal communities, they instead prop up unsustainable and unprofitable fishing activity, depleting the very resource on which local populations’ livelihoods depend. This problem is not new. In fact, the World Trade Organization’s members have been trying to negotiate a deal to curb these damaging payments since 2001. World leaders reiterated their commitment to tackling the issue when they agreed in 2015 to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Under SDG 14, which aims to put a healthy ocean at the heart of the global sustainable-development agenda, leaders promised by 2020 to reach an agreement at the WTO that would reduce fisheries subsidies. But they missed the deadline, as negotiations slowed during the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic. Research shows that if WTO members were to eliminate all harmful fisheries subsidies – the most ambitious scenario – global fish biomass could increase by 12.5% by 2050. That’s an additional 35 million metric tons of fish, or more than four times North America’s annual fish consumption in 2017. And this is a conservative estimate. Removing destructive subsidies really will mean more fish in the sea. The aim is not to remove support from fishing communities, but rather to redirect it in a more meaningful and less damaging way. Even if a deal does not eliminate all harmful subsidies, it would create a global framework of accountability and transparency for subsidy programs. That, in turn, would spur dialogue between governments, fishing communities, and other stakeholders to spur the development of redesigned policies that better support fisherfolk while protecting our global commons. Moreover, an agreement is within reach – if the political will is there to deliver it. The most recent lapse of the negotiations resulted from differences over how to structure flexibility in subsidy regimes for developing countries, as well as how to define and enforce rules on illegal fishing and sustainable stocks. But after numerous proposals and discussions, the comprehensive draft now on the table combines measures to curb harmful subsidies with specific exceptions for developing countries. With the start of the WTO’s 12th Ministerial Conference in Geneva just days away, now is the moment for a deal. Failure to conclude one would not only harm the ocean and the livelihoods of those who depend upon it, but also would diminish the global rules-based system and damage the pursuit of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. In contrast, ending harmful fisheries subsidies would reduce the cumulative pressures on the ocean and increase its resilience in the face of climate change. In the wake of the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) in Glasgow, governments must demonstrate their willingness to use every tool at their disposal to tackle the climate crisis. The stakes at the upcoming WTO Ministerial Conference have perhaps never been higher. The future of multilateral trade cooperation is at risk; but, above all, jobs, food security, and the health of our global commons are on the line. That is why 33 former government leaders and ministers from around the world have joined forces with nearly 400 scientists in urging WTO members to “harness their political mandate to protect the health of the ocean and the well-being of society.” Governments have given their word that they will curb destructive fisheries subsidies. Next week’s meeting in Geneva will test the credibility of that pledge.

            "参与拯救海洋协议 奥克兰/马德里/维多利亚/安西皇家海滩—海洋覆盖了70% 以上的地球表面，产生了一半我们呼吸的氧气，养活了数十亿人，还提供了数亿个工作岗位。 它还在减缓气候变化方面发挥着重要作用：超过 80% 的全球碳循环通过海洋进行。 但这一宝贵的自然资源并非不可战胜。 尽管海洋为我们提供了各种好处，但如今它面临着前所未有的人为危机，威胁到它的健康和它维持地球生命的能力。 对海洋生物多样性的最大威胁是过度捕捞。 全球超过三分之一的鱼类种群被过度捕捞，另有 60% 的鱼类种群被完全捕捞。 每年，世界各国政府向有害渔业提供220亿美元补贴，这刺激了过度捕捞。 这些补贴原本旨在支持沿海社区，但结果反而助长了不可持续和无利可图的捕鱼活动，耗尽了本地居民生计所依赖的资源。 这个问题并不新鲜。 事实上，自 2001 年以来，世界贸易组织各成员一直试图通过谈判达成一项协议，遏制这些破坏性支付。 世界领导人在 2015 年同意了可持续发展目标 (SDG ) ， 时重申了他们解决这一问题的承诺。 根据SDG 14 — — 其旨在将健康的海洋作为全球可持续发展议程的核心 — — 各国领导人在2020年承诺在WTO达成协议，减少渔业补贴。 但他们错过了最后期限，新冠疫情的肆虐导致谈判放缓。 研究表明，如果世贸组织成员取消所有有害渔业补贴 — — 最雄心勃勃的设想 — — 那么到 2050 年，全球鱼类生物量可以增加 12.5 % 。 这是额外的 3500 万吨鱼类，或2017年北美年度鱼类消费量的四倍多。 而这是一个保守的估计。 取消破坏性补贴真的意味着海里会有更多的鱼。 其目的不是取消渔业社区支持，而是以更有意义、破坏性更小的方式重新定向。 即使协议不能消除所有有害补贴，也会为补贴计划创建一个问责制和透明度的全球框架。 这反过来将刺激政府、渔业社区和其他利益相关者之间的对话，促进重新设计政策，在保护全球公域的同时更好地支持渔民。 此外，如果有实现它的政治意愿，那么协议是可以达成的。 最近的谈判失败原因在于，在如何实现发展中国家补贴机制的灵活性，以及如何定义和执行关于非法捕鱼和可持续种群的规则方面存在分歧。 但经过多次提议和讨论，现在摆在桌面上的综合草案既有遏制有害补贴的措施，也有对发展中国家的特定例外。 几天后，世贸组织第12届部长级会议将在日内瓦召开，现在应该达成协议了。 如果不能达成协议，不仅会损害海洋和依赖海洋的人们的生计，还会削弱基于规则的全球体系，并损害 2030 年可持续发展议程的落实。 相比之下，结束有害渔业补贴将减少对海洋的累积压力，提高其面对气候变化的韧性。 在格拉斯哥联合国气候变化会议 (COP26) 之后，各国政府必须表明他们愿意使用一切可用工具来应对气候危机。 即将召开的世贸组织部长级会议的意义前所未有地重大。 多边贸易合作的未来岌岌可危；但最重要的是，就业、粮食安全和全球公域的健康也都岌岌可危。 这就是为什么来自世界各地的 33 位前政府领导人和部长与近 400 名科学家联手敦促世贸组织成员“利用他们的政治使命来保护海洋健康和社会福祉 ” 。 各国政府已承诺将遏制破坏性渔业补贴。 下周在日内瓦举行的会议将检验这一承诺的可信度。 本评论署名者还有：Axel Addy – 利比里亚工商部长（2013-18 年 ） ； Mercedes Aráoz – 秘鲁总理（2017-18）和秘鲁副总统（2016-2020 ） ； Hakim Ben Hammouda – 突尼斯经济和财政部长（2014-15 ） ； Herminio Blanco – 墨西哥贸易和工业部长（1994-2000 ） ； Maria Damanaki – 欧盟海事和渔业专员（2010-14 ） ； Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle – 智利总统（1994-2000 ） ； Michael Froman – 美国贸易代表（2013-17 ） ； Tim Groser – 新西兰贸易部长（2008-2015 ） ； Enrique V.

            "New Global Rules for a Fairer Food Future GENEVA – This year, governments can ensure that better international rules help get us back on track toward a fairer and more sustainable agricultural trading system, and overcome recent setbacks in our efforts to tackle hunger and malnutrition. The United Nations Food Systems Summit in September, the UN climate conference (COP26) in November, and the World Trade Organization ministerial conference starting later that month provide policymakers ample opportunity to deliver. The COVID-19 pandemic, economic downturns, climate change, and conflict have all contributed to an increase in hunger and malnutrition. And the recent report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is the latest in a series of warnings that show why governments must take immediate bold action to address the challenges we face. In particular, governments should focus on correcting and reducing the distortions currently burdening food and agricultural markets. If policymakers can improve how these markets function, vulnerable producers and consumers stand to benefit the most. Clearly, business as usual is not an option. According to recent estimates from UN agencies, between 720 million and 811 million people faced hunger in 2020. Moreover, moderate or severe food insecurity has climbed slowly for the past six years, and now affects nearly one in three people globally. We must change course if we are to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal of ending hunger and malnutrition by the end of this decade. The expected increase in the world’s population to nearly ten billion by 2050 adds a further element of urgency. Better rules regarding trade and markets can help improve food security by supporting efforts to create jobs, raise incomes, and boost agricultural productivity sustainably. Better-functioning markets would also bolster the food system’s resilience to global warming, as temperature and precipitation patterns change, and extreme weather events such as droughts, floods, and storms become more frequent and intense. At the same time, the recent uptick in hunger and malnutrition must be seen in the context of the significant progress achieved in the last quarter-century. During this period, tens of millions of people have been lifted out of poverty and food insecurity as average incomes have risen and markets have become more integrated. According to the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization, trade in food and agriculture has more than doubled in real terms since 1995, with the share of trade between developing countries also growing rapidly. Recently, new digital technologies have contributed to a transformation in food and agricultural markets by increasing productivity and easing cross-border trade in goods and services. Furthermore, countries have negotiated and signed a growing number of new bilateral and regional trade agreements as they seek to improve their market access and deepen integration with trading partners – both in neighboring regions and farther afield. But, efforts to update global trade rules for food and agriculture have advanced only slowly. At a 2015 meeting in Nairobi, trade ministers struck a deal to end agricultural export subsidies, thereby fulfilling one clear commitment under the SDGs. And in Bali two years earlier, countries reached an agreement under WTO auspices on other food and agriculture issues as part of a broader trade package. But much more needs to be done in order to address longstanding problems in food and agricultural markets, and ensure that global rules are also fit for purpose in the future. In the run-up to the WTO’s ministerial conference, I am chairing talks among negotiators on a slate of seven farm-trade topics, including subsidies for goods such as cotton, restrictions on food exports, and the challenge of improving farmers’ access to markets. Also on the agenda are rules governing the procurement of food for public stocks, safeguards for farm goods, and rules on measures that resemble export subsidies. In all areas, improving transparency by making more information easily available is a critical concern for many countries. Ministers could take a significant step forward at the WTO conference by agreeing to an outcome on food and agriculture that helps to rebuild trust, lays out a path forward, and galvanizes political engagement. This would enable us to re-establish confidence in our collective ability to address the challenges we face. Today, we must strive to overcome the pandemic, build more inclusive and sustainable economies, and lay the foundations for a fairer and more resilient future. An agreement at the WTO that improves food and agricultural trade rules would be an important start.",
            "保证更公平的粮食未来的新全球规则 日内瓦—今年，各国政府可以确保更好的国际规则帮助我们回到更公平、更可持续的农业贸易体系的轨道上，并克服我们最近在应对饥饿和营养不良方面所遇到的挫折。 9 月的联合国粮食体系峰会、11 月的联合国气候大会 (COP26) 以及当月晚些时候开始的世界贸易组织部长级会议为政策制定者提供了充分的实现机会。 新冠疫情、经济衰退、气候变化和冲突都导致了饥饿和营养不良的增加。 政府间气候变化专门委员会的最新报告为一系列警告再续新篇，说明了为什么政府必须立即采取果断行动来应对我们面临的挑战。 特别是，政府应重点纠正和减少令当前粮食和农产品市场不堪重负的扭曲。 如果政策制定者能够改善这些市场的运行，那么脆弱的生产者和消费者将受益最大。 显然，一切照旧不在选项之列。 据联合国机构的最新估计，2020 年有7.2亿到8.11亿人面临饥饿。 此外，中度或重度粮食不安全状况在过去六年中缓慢攀升，现在影响到全球近三分之一人口。 如果我们要在这个十年末实现消除饥饿和营养不良的可持续发展目标（SDG ） ， 就必须改变方向。 预计到 2050 年，世界人口将增加到近100亿，这进一步增加了紧迫性。 更好的贸易和市场规则可以支持创造就业机会、增加收入和可持续地提高农业生产力的措施，从而有助于改善粮食安全。 随着温度和降水模式发生变化，以及干旱、洪水和风暴等极端天气事件变得更加频繁和剧烈，运转良好的市场还可以增强粮食体系面对全球变暖的韧性。 与此同时，最近饥饿和营养不良的上升必须置于过去四分之一世纪取得重大进展的背景下看待。 在此期间，随着平均收入的提高和市场更加一体化，数以千万计的人摆脱了贫困和粮食不安全。 根据联合国粮食及农业组织的数据，自 1995 年以来，粮食和农业贸易实际增长了一倍以上，发展中国家之间的贸易份额也在快速增长。 最近，新的数字技术通过提高生产力和放宽跨境商品和服务贸易，促进了粮食和农业市场的转型。 此外，各国在寻求改善市场准入、深化与邻近和更远地区的贸易伙伴的一体化的过程中，谈判和签署了越来越多的新双边和区域贸易协定。 但是，更新全球粮食和农业贸易规则的措施进展缓慢。 2015 年在内罗毕举行的一次会议上，贸易部长们达成了一项终止农业补贴的协议，从而实现了SDG下的一项明确承诺。 两年前在巴厘岛，各国在世贸组织的主持下就其他粮食和农业问题达成协议，作为更广泛的贸易方案的一部分。 但要解决粮食和农业市场长期存在的问题，并确保全球规则适用于未来的目的，还需要做更多的工作。 在世贸组织部长级会议即将召开之际，我正在主持谈判代表之间的对华，讨论七个农业贸易问题，包括对棉花等商品的补贴、对粮食出口的限制以及改善农民市场准入的挑战。 议程还包括公共库存粮食采购规则、农产品保障措施以及类似出口补贴的措施的规则。 在所有领域，通过让更多信息更容易获取来提高透明度是许多国家的一个关键问题。 部长们可以在世贸组织会议上向前迈出重要的一步，达成一项粮食与农业的公示结果，帮助重建信任、规划前进道路、激发政治参与。 这将使我们能够重新建立对于我们应对所面临的挑战的集体能力的信心。 今天，我们必须努力战胜疫情，建设更具包容性和可持续性的经济，并为更公平、更有韧性的未来奠定基础。 世贸组织达成一项改进粮食和农产品贸易规则的协议将是一个重要的开端。"

            "An Opportunity for the WTO ONTARIO – This December, trade ministers from around the world will converge in Buenos Aires for the World Trade Organization’s 11th Ministerial Conference. With the United States, which has historically led the world toward trade liberalization, now actively stoking trade tensions, the meeting is set to be unlike any other. The WTO’s ministerial gatherings are never easy. Some kind of agreement is usually delivered, but only at the last minute, and its language is often vague. This time, however, the outcome might be even more disappointing, with delegates unable to reach even a symbolic agreement that they can tout with an aggressive marketing campaign. The current tensions over free trade, rooted in the uneven distribution of its benefits, cannot be resolved within the WTO, let alone by a ministerial gathering. But that doesn’t mean that the upcoming conference must be for naught. On the contrary, it should serve as a critical opportunity to initiate the update and recalibration that the WTO needs to remain an effective platform for international trade cooperation and consensus-building. One key problem that must be addressed relates to “special and differential treatment” (S&D). About two thirds of the WTO’s 164 members have declared themselves developing countries – a label that entitles them to S&D provisions, including the authority to maintain trade tariffs for a longer period of time. With the WTO lacking any benchmarks or indicators to determine when a country should be weaned off S&D, it is no surprise that no developing country has ever “developed.” To be sure, since S&D was first introduced in 1979, many developing countries have grown richer. But they have shown no indication that they are ready to relinquish the benefits of S&D, even for industries that have become internationally competitive. It is hard to argue that all developing countries should enjoy the indefinite privilege of opting out of the WTO’s general obligations for all sectors of their economies. And with so many of their WTO partners claiming preferential status, developed-country members often resist trade concessions within the organization, preferring to conduct negotiations in other forums. The dynamic in the WTO stands in stark contrast to that within the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. At the WTO, developed countries would like to see big emerging markets take on more obligations, while developing countries resist. At the Bretton Woods institutions, developed countries are blocking emerging economies from gaining greater influence. But the two dynamics have something in common: intransigence, even if coming from different quarters, reflects a denial of reality. In the Bretton Woods institutions, the emerging economies are right that their increased economic weight should correlate with larger capital contributions and more weight in decision-making. In the WTO, S&D clearly needs to be updated to ensure that it benefits only countries that actually need it. Ministers at the conference in Buenos Aires should thus be prepared to have an honest discussion about S&D. A second topic that the WTO needs to address relates to consensus-building. Under current WTO rules, most decisions can be adopted by a majority vote. But the long-standing practice has been to adopt all decisions by consensus. This is wise and should not change. Though consensus-building can be slow and cumbersome, it is the only way to generate the legitimacy that WTO decisions need. A simple majority vote, after all, would fail to account for differences in market size. And weighted voting would undermine the WTO’s capacity to settle disputes by adjudicating rights and obligations among members of different size and political heft. The problem is that consensus is interpreted as an unlimited veto power, such that a member can block any discussion on matters of interest to others. A consensus-based approach can work only if it entails an obligation by all members to work toward shared interests, with members objecting formally only to decisions running counter to some fundamental interest. The Paris climate agreement was made possible by a simple method called “Indaba,” adopted from the Zulu and Xhosa people of South Africa. Negotiators had the right to withhold consent, but only if they put forth alternate proposals aimed at finding common ground. If Indaba worked in Paris, it could also work at the WTO. In Buenos Aires, ministers should discuss how to ensure that WTO members responsibly exercise their right to block decisions. The final issue that ministers should be prepared to discuss in Buenos Aires is the need to ensure that the WTO adapts effectively to a changing international environment. The problems with both S&D and consensus decision-making at the WTO are not new, but they have long been ignored, allowing them to deepen. This would not have happened if incremental reform was ingrained in the WTO’s regular activities. Both the IMF and the World Bank have policy watchdogs that regularly scrutinize and evaluate their functioning. Running on very small budgets, these ruthless truth-tellers regularly force their institutions’ leaders to have honest discussions about organizational effectiveness and possible reforms. Such an independent office for evaluation is precisely what the WTO needs. The WTO cannot sweep its problems under the carpet forever. The question is whether it will undertake the reforms it needs now or wait until a costly crisis leaves it no choice.",
            "世贸组织的一个良机 发自安大略 — — 十二月，世界各地的贸易部长将齐聚布宜诺斯艾利斯参加世界贸易组织（WTO）第十一次部长级会议。 但本届会议注定与往届有所不同，因为美国这个一直以来引领全球迈向贸易自由化的国家如今却在积极挑动贸易紧张局势了。 世贸组织部长级会议永远都不那么顺利。 会上通常能达成某些协议，但往往要等到最后一刻才形成共识，协议用词也大多模棱两可。 然而本届结果可能更令人失望，代表们甚至无法达成一个令他们可以在大型选举造势活动中为自己脸上贴金的象征性协议。 目前自由贸易中的紧张局势源自于各方收益的分配不均，而这无法在WTO框架内解决，更不可能在部长级会议上找到答案。 但这并不意味着即将到来的会议注定毫无意义。 相反，如果世贸组织想要保持自身作为国际贸易合作和共识构建有效平台的地位，就必须借助这个关键机会实施所需的更新和重整。 其中必须解决的一个关键问题与“特殊和差别性待遇”有关。 世贸组织164个成员中有2/3宣称自己是发展中国家，这个标签使他们有权获得一些优待，包括在更长时期内收取贸易关税的权力。 由于世贸组织并没有任何基准或指标来确定一个国家何时应该脱离特殊和差别性待遇，因此没有任何发展中国家会变成“发达 ” 。 但自从1979年首次引进该条款以来，许多发展中国家早已发展壮大，可即便其国内某些行业已经具备国际竞争力，它们也没打算放弃这类优待所带来的利益。 很难说所有发展中国家都应享有无限期特权来避免承担世贸组织对其经济中所有部门所下达的一般义务。 而由于太多世贸组织合作伙伴都声称享有优惠地位，发达国家成员国往往会抵制组织框架内的贸易让步，而更愿意在其他平台上展开谈判。 而世贸组织内部的动态则与国际货币基金组织和世界银行形成了鲜明对比。 在世贸组织中，发达国家希望看到各大新兴市场国家承担更多的义务，而发展中国家则抵制；在布雷顿森林体系机构内，发达国家却在遏制新兴经济体获得更大的影响力。 但这两股动态存在一些共同点：即使来自不同阵营，却都反映了对现实的否定。 在布雷顿森林体系机构中，新兴经济体不断增大的经济体量应当与更大的出资比重和决策权重相关联。 世贸组织的优待条款显然也需要更新，确保只有那些真正有需要的国家才能受益。 因此布宜诺斯艾利斯会议的部长们应该准备针对优待条款展开诚布公的讨论。 世贸组织需要处理的第二个议题涉及到共识的建立。 根据当前的世贸组织规则，大多数决策都可以通过多数赞成票来达成。 但长期以来的做法是以协商一致的方式来通过所有决策。 这是明智且无须改变的。 虽然建立共识可能冗长而繁琐，但这是世贸组织决策获取所需合法性的唯一途径。 毕竟简单的多数投票将无法体现市场规模的差异。 而加权投票则会破坏世贸组织通过对不同规模和政治影响力的成员之间的权利和义务进行裁定来解决争端的能力。 但问题在于共识被曲解成了无限制的否决权，这样一个成员就可以阻止别人去讨论一切事关他人利益的问题。 如果某项共识能赋予所有成员国责任去追求共同利益，那么寻求公识的手段才能起作用，因为成员国只会对与某些根本利益相违背的决定提出正式反对。 巴黎气候协议就是借助南非祖鲁和科萨人称为“因达巴会议（Indaba ） ” 的简单方法达成的 — — 谈判者有权拒绝共识，但只能是在提出旨在寻求共同点的替代建议之后。 如果因达巴可以在巴黎奏效，那么当然也可以用在世贸组织上。 在布宜诺斯艾利斯，部长们应讨论如何确保世贸组织成员负责地行使其否决权。 部长们应该在布宜诺斯艾利斯讨论的最后一个问题是如何确保世贸组织能有效适应不断变化的国际环境。 世贸组织的特殊和差别性待遇以及共识决策问题长期存在，却又一直被忽视以致不断恶化。 如果渐进式改革能根植于世贸组织的日常活动中，这种情况就不会发生了。 国际货币基金组织和世行都有设有政策监督机构来定期审查和评估自身的运作。 这些真相的无情揭露者不需多少运行经费，却能经常迫使本机构的领导层就组织效率和可能实施的改革开展诚恳的讨论。 而这样一个独立评估办公室正是世贸组织所需要的。 世贸组织不可能永远掩盖自己的问题。 问题在于它能否立刻进行所需的改革，还是等待一场巨大的危机将其逼到墙角。"

            "Don’t Let Tariffs Break the Internet PARIS – Most people have never heard of the World Trade Organization’s moratorium on customs duties on electronic transmissions. And yet it may be one of the most important trade deals in recent history, given the outsize effect it has had on the growth of the Internet. The moratorium – which has been renewed by WTO member states every two years since 1998 – has enabled the digital economy to flourish by prohibiting governments from applying tariffs to international data flows. It has thus shielded the Internet from distortions induced by levies at national borders. As such, the online sphere has been a virtual utopia, the likes of which trade economists can only dream when it comes to real-world commerce. But this paradise will soon be lost unless cool heads prevail. A handful of countries – most notably India, South Africa, and Sri Lanka – have signaled their intention to let the moratorium lapse at the end of this year. That would leave governments free to begin experimenting with unilateral tariffs on everything from software, e-books, and cloud services to the data underlying popular streaming services. Proponents of ending the moratorium argue that the digitalization of previously physical goods – books to e-books, CDs to Spotify, DVDs to Netflix – has resulted in a loss of tariff revenues. Viewed through this narrow lens, the notion of applying duties to digital transactions may seem appealing to politicians seeking to protect domestic revenue bases, and who are increasingly feeling public pressure to tax the global tech giants. But applying tariffs to data flows would be a chimerical answer to a very real challenge. Not only would such a move add to a damaging pattern of escalating tariffs; it would also wreak potential havoc in the online economy. Move over Kim Kardashian: tariffs really could “break the Internet.” Tariffs on data would cause economic harm to the very countries that imposed them. As a study by the European Center for International Political Economy shows, tariffs on digital goods and services would lead to higher prices and reduced consumption – slowing GDP growth and shrinking tax revenues. The OECD has also recently entered the fray, finding that the opportunity cost in terms of lost revenue due to the moratorium is low, and far outweighed by the increase in consumer welfare brought about by digitalization. Moreover, no customs authority has been able to demonstrate how a digital tariff system would work in practice. Consider video streaming: the moment you begin watching content on your smartphone app – whether in Jakarta, Paris, or Mumbai – your device begins receiving packets of data from servers in nearby countries. While viewing a single movie, your device could receive as many as five million data packets from nine separate jurisdictions. It would be prohibitively expensive for customs officials to track these millions of electronic transmissions and determine their origin, and it would be nearly impossible to quantify their value. How, then, would countries accurately (and impartially) calculate the tariff on a single viewing session, byte of data, or file size, let alone on the endless stream of data and messages that enable modern business-to-business transactions? And how would they do so at a speed congruent with that of the digital economy? There are no clear answers to these questions. Complicating matters further is the fact that around 60 existing bilateral and regional trade agreements – covering some 80 countries – contain independent provisions prohibiting the application of customs duties on cross-border data. Were the moratorium to lapse, these provisions would still be in effect, leading to an exceedingly complex digital trade environment and the creation of distortionary incentives to re-route data through duty-free jurisdictions. But, more to the point, digital tariff barriers are simply unnecessary. Governments already have other ways to address potential losses in fiscal revenue from digitalization. Australia, for example, has successfully implemented a non-resident digital goods and services tax. After just one year, revenue from the tax has surpassed expectations, and compliance is high. Moreover, the OECD is making steady progress on developing a consensus solution to the tax challenges arising from the digital economy. A practical and robust conclusion to this work must be reached (indeed, it cannot come soon enough). At a time when new tariffs are already placing a significant drag on global growth, the last thing we need is for the WTO’s digital moratorium to lapse, opening up a vast new front for protectionists and anxious politicians to exploit. The real answer to the conundrum of how best to tax the digital economy ultimately lies outside the WTO, and well beyond the remit of national customs agencies. We can only hope common sense will prevail, and that the most important trade deal you (probably) never heard of will be renewed this December.",
            "莫让关税毁了互联网 巴黎—大部分人从未听说过世界贸易组织叫停电子传输关税。 但这也许是近几年来最重要的贸易协议，因为它给互联网的成长造成了巨大的影响。 这一叫停操作 — — 自1988年依赖，世贸组织成员国每两年都会更新一次 — — 禁止政府对跨国数据流征收关税，从而实现了数字经济的繁荣。 互联网也因此免于边境税收而造成的扭曲。 在线世界也因此成为一个虚拟乌托邦，实现了贸易经济学家在现实世界的商业中做梦都不敢想的状态。 但如果冷静之士不能胜出，我们马上将失去这个天堂。 一小撮国家 — — 主要是印度、南非和斯里兰卡 — — 表示在今年年底不再准备让关税暂停再度延长。 这样一来，政府就可以尝试对一切东西征收关税，包括软件、电子书、云服务和流行的流服务的基本数据等。 支持结束暂停关税者指出，实体商品的数字化 — — 书籍变成电子书籍，CD变成Spotify，DVD变成Netflix — — 导致关税收入损失。 从这一狭隘的观念出发，对数字交易征税的概念可能会让试图保护国内收入基础，以及日渐感到要对全球科技巨头征税的压力的政客感到颇具诱惑力。 但对数据流征收关税根本无法解决非常现实的挑战。 这样做不仅会带来关税升级的危险模式；也将给在线经济带拉力一场浩劫。 超越金·卡戴珊（Kim Kardashian ） ： 关税真的可以“毁掉互联网 ” 。 数据关税会给所有实施国带来经济损失。 欧洲国际政治经济中心（European Center for International Political Economy）的一项研究表明，数字商品和服务关税将导致价格升高，消费降低 — — 拖累GDP增长并让税收收入缩水。 经合组织最近也加入战团，认为关税暂停所造成的收入下降的机会成本较低，远小于数字化所带来的消费者福利的提高。 此外，关税当局无法说明数字关税系统在实际中如何操作。 以视频流为例：在你打开手机应用观看内容的那一刻 — — 不管是在雅加达，巴黎还是孟买 — — 你的设备开始接收位于邻近国家的服务器的数据包。 当你观看一部电影时，你的设备可能会从九个不同司法辖区接收多达五百万个数据包。 海关官员需要费尽九牛二虎之力才能追踪这数百万起电子传输，确定它们的源头，而量化它们的价值几乎是不可能的任务。 那么，各国如何正确（并公平）地计算一次观看行为，1比特数据，或1个文件大小的关税？ 更不用说现代企业间交易所需要的无穷无尽的数据和信息流。 它们如何以适应数字经济的速度做到这一点？ 这些问题都没有明确的答案。 令情况更加复杂的是一个事实：现有的大约60个双边和地区贸易协定 — — 涉及到大约80个国家 — — 包含各自的禁止对跨境数据征收关税的条款。 如果停征关税规定作废，这些条款仍将生效，数字交易环境将变得极其复杂，形成改变数据通路、借道免税司法区的扭曲激励。 但更重要的是，数字关税壁垒是毫无必要的。 政府已有其他办法可用于解决数字化所造成的潜在财政收入损失。 比如，澳大利亚成功实施了非居民数字商品和服务税。 仅仅一年后，该税收入便超过了预期，遵守情况良好。 此外，经合组织也在稳步推进制定应对数字经济所带来的税收挑战的共识方案。 这项工作必须形成实际而可靠的结论（事实上，近期还无法形成 ） 。 如今，新关税已经对全球增长造成重大拖累，我们绝不能让世贸组织的数字关税暂停被取消，从而为保护主义者和焦虑的政客打开新的前沿阵地。 如何最好地对数字经济征税的难题的真正答案不在于世贸组织，也完全不在于各国海关。 我们只能寄希望于常识能够胜出，你（可能）从未听过的最重要的贸易协议能够在今年12月份再度更新。"

            "Let the WTO Referee Carbon Border Taxes CAMBRIDGE – Perhaps the most important task confronting the international order is enforcement of national limits on greenhouse-gas emissions, such as those that were negotiated in the 2015 Paris agreement. Carbon border adjustments could give these limits teeth, but fair application requires a revived World Trade Organization. Past attempts at curtailing carbon dioxide emissions have yielded limited results. China and other emerging and developing economies resist curbing their rapidly rising emissions, understandably arguing that the industrialized countries should go first because they created the problem. To be sure, the European Union has had some success, raising the price of CO2 on that continent to around €75 ($78) per ton through its Emissions Trading System. And the United States recently passed the Inflation Reduction Act, which heavily subsidizes electric vehicles and other green technologies, though the country still balks at a carbon tax. Despite good intentions, these global efforts have not put much of a dent in climate change. Negotiators continue to waste time haggling over whether to set a global target of 1.5º or 2º Celsius for the magnitude of global warming. But existing national emission policies are too lax to achieve either outcome. Most countries have failed to meet even their own standards. Enforcement is nonexistent. When countries miss their targets, they are not called out, let alone penalized by the international community. Carbon leakage and global competition greatly exacerbate the problem. If a country imposes regulatory costs on its own carbon-intensive domestic firms, production tends to move to lower-cost countries. Carbon border adjustment measures offer a potential way around this collective action problem, because they raise the cost of cheaper, carbon-intensive imports that threaten to undercut rule-abiding domestic firms. Tariffs level the playing field by making it harder for industries to offshore their emissions to countries with lower regulatory standards and compliance costs. They also encourage governments to join the club of countries making serious commitments and then to abide by them. The EU is expected to finalize plans for a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) in December. Beginning in 2026, the EU will impose tariffs on imports to equalize CO2 prices between domestic producers and their foreign competitors. The mechanism is designed to protect the most carbon-intensive EU industries, beginning with five: aluminum, iron and steel, cement, fertilizer, and electric power generation. The European Parliament wants to expand the list to encompass other industries, including those with indirect emissions. The EU’s border mechanism could be a major step toward a more effective global market. But it comes with dangers. American firms will likely feel threatened and cry foul. EU officials say the mechanism will comply with WTO rules, and they may turn out to be right. WTO members are already permitted to enact trade barriers for environmental ends, so long as the measures do not unfairly discriminate against foreign firms. There are precedents for the WTO’s environmental exceptions. Article XX (b) and (g), which dates back to the WTO’s predecessor, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, allows exceptions to protect health and natural resources. The preamble to the 1994 Marrakesh Agreement, which established the WTO, makes clear that this includes environmental objectives, as do subsequent rulings, beginning with a 1996 decision on US gasoline imports. Most notably, the WTO dispute settlement mechanism upheld non-discriminatory environmental exceptions in the famous 1998 shrimp-turtle case. A 2007 WTO Appellate Body decision on some Brazilian import restrictions also confirmed the applicability of Article XX, finding that the rules accord considerable flexibility to WTO member governments when they take trade-restrictive measures to protect life or health, and that problems like global warming are included. Adjudicating CO2 border taxation would be a natural job for a revived WTO, if its members were to give it the mandate. Even the US, which has stifled the Appellate Body by leaving it inquorate since 2019, might rediscover the usefulness of the WTO dispute settlement mechanism. It could take a case to the WTO if the EU CBAM were to become protectionist, whether by including too many industries with indirect and hard-to-quantify CO2 use, or by over-estimating the gap in the effective prices of carbon in the US and EU. An environmentally-driven reinvigoration of the WTO would benefit developing countries, too. Vietnam and other Asian countries could bring cases targeting US and EU trade barriers against imports of solar panels and other renewable energy equipment. Similarly, the “buy American” aspects of the Inflation Reduction Act might give US trading partners reason to litigate, rather than simply retaliate. Producers in plaintiff countries would benefit, but so would US buyers, who would gain from cheaper solar panels, wind turbines, batteries, and electric cars. Instead of an environmental trade war, a revived WTO could foster new norms for beneficial CO2 border taxes and generate a wave of trade in green goods and services. WTO Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala wants to revive lapsed negotiations to liberalize trade in environmental equipment. The resulting green globalization would benefit every country – and above all the planet.",
            "让WTO来裁定碳边境税 发自剑桥 — — 当前国际秩序所面临的最重要任务或许是执行各国对温室气体排放的限制，比如2015年巴黎协定中谈判的那些。 碳边界调整措施可以使这些限制产生效力，但公平的应用则需要一个重新振兴的世界贸易组织。 过去在遏制二氧化碳排放方面的尝试取得了一些有限的成果。 中国和其他新兴和发展中经济体反对遏制其迅速上升的排放量，也合乎情理地认为工业化国家应当首先采取行动，因为问题是由它们造成的。 可以肯定的是欧盟在这方面已经取得了一些成功，通过其排放交易系统将欧洲大陆的二氧化碳价格提高到了每吨75欧元左右（折合78美元 ） 。 尽管美国对碳税仍持保留态度，但该国最近也通过了大力补贴电动汽车和其他绿色技术的《削减通货膨胀法 》 。 尽管本意是好的，但这些全球努力并未对气候变化产生多大影响。 谈判者们继续把时间浪费在争论应该把全球变暖程度目标设定在1.5还是2摄氏度上。 但现行的各项国家排放政策都过于宽松，无法达成以上两个温度目标。 大多数国家甚至连自身标准都没能达到。 强制执行是不存在的。 那些未能达到目标的国家没有被点名批评，更不会遭到国际社会惩罚。 碳泄漏和全球竞争大大加剧了这个问题。 如果一个国家对本国碳密集型企业施加监管成本，那么生产往往会被转移到其他成本较低的国家。 而碳边境调整措施则提供了一个解决这一集体行动问题的潜在途径，因为它们拉高了更廉价碳密集型进口产品的成本，使之无法再削弱那些遵守相关规则的国内企业。 关税使工业界更难将其排放转移到监管标准和合规成本较低的国家，从而使竞争环境变得更为公平，还能激励各国政府加入一些作出严肃承诺的国家俱乐部并信守这些承诺。 欧盟预计将在12月敲定碳边境调整机制（Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism）的相关方案。 从2026年开始欧盟将对进口产品征收关税以平衡区内生产商与区外竞争对手之间的二氧化碳价格。 该机制旨在保护欧盟那些碳密集度最高的行业，首先作用于铝、钢铁、水泥，化肥和发电这五个行业。 欧洲议会希望扩大这个名单以涵盖其他行业，包括一些产生间接排放的行业。 欧盟的边界机制或许是迈向更有效全球市场的重要一步。 但它也带来了风险，让一些美国企业感到了威胁并四处喊冤。 欧盟官员说该机制将遵守世贸组织规则，而他们可能是正确的。 世贸组织成员已经被允许为环境目的制定贸易壁垒，只要这些措施不对外国企业造成不公平歧视就行。 世贸组织的环境豁免是有先例的。 其第二十条(b)和(g)款可以追溯到该组织前身《关税与贸易总协定》中允许保护健康和自然资源的例外规定。 建立世贸组织的1994年《马拉喀什建立世界贸易组织协定》在其序言中明确指出这里面包括环境目标，随后始于1996年美国汽油进口标准裁决的各项裁决也是如此。 最值得注意的是，世贸组织争端解决机制在著名的1998年美国海虾海龟案中秉承了非歧视性环境例外原则。 2007年世贸组织上诉机构对巴西某些进口物品限制的裁决也确认了第20条的适用性，当世贸组织成员国政府为保护生命或健康而采取贸易限制措施时这些规则能赋予它们相当大的灵活性，同时像全球变暖这样的问题也包括在内。 如果世贸组织成员能给予其授权，裁决二氧化碳边境税将是复兴后的世贸组织的一项天然职责。 就算是自2019年以来通过让上诉机构缺乏足够员额而扼杀该机构的美国也可能重新发现世贸组织争端解决机制的效用 — — 如果欧盟的碳边境调整机制沦为保护主义行径（无论是纳入太多间接和难以量化的二氧化碳使用行业，还是通过高估美国和欧盟之间的有效碳价格差距 ） ， 它都可以向世贸组织提起诉讼。 以环境为导向的世贸组织重振也将使发展中国家受益。 越南和其他亚洲国家可以针对美国和欧盟对太阳能电池板和其他可再生能源设备的进口贸易壁垒提起诉讼。 同样 ， 《 削减通货膨胀法》中“购买美国货”的内容可能会赋予美国的贸易伙伴一些诉讼依据，而不是简单地促使它们实施报复。 原告国的生产者将受益，但美国的买家们也有好处 — — 他们能因此获得更便宜的太阳能电池板、风力涡轮机，电池和电动汽车。 与其触发一场环境贸易战，复兴的世贸组织可以为各类有益的二氧化碳边境税孕育一系列新规范，并催生一波绿色产品和服务贸易。 世贸组织总干事恩戈齐·奥孔乔-伊韦阿拉（Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala）也希望重启那些已经失效的谈判来实现环境设备的贸易自由化。 而由此产生的绿色全球化将使每个国家 — — 以及整个地球 — — 受益。"

            "The WTO Reborn? NEW DELHI – For too long, the World Trade Organization has languished, to lift a reference from T.S. Eliot, by the “waters of Leman” (Lake Geneva). Once the world’s preeminent multilateral trade forum, the WTO has been steadily marginalized in recent years, and recent rebukes of globalization, such as the United Kingdom’s Brexit vote and the election of Donald Trump as US president, suggest that this trend will accelerate. But these outcomes may actually have the opposite effect, owing to three key developments that could enable the revival of the WTO – and of the multilateralism that it embodies. The first development is the decline of alternative trade arrangements. The WTO reached its peak in the early 2000s, a few years after the Uruguay Round of global trade negotiations concluded, and a time when more countries – most notably China – were acceding to the organization. But major trade players like the United States and the European Union subsequently shifted their focus from multilateral trade agreements to bilateral, regional, and mega-regional deals. The mega-regionals – namely, the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) – posed a particularly grave threat to the WTO. Yet those are precisely the deals that the Trump administration is rejecting, or at least postponing. European integration had a similar impact on the WTO, as it provided an alternative platform for managing intra-European trade. But the European project has fallen on hard times, the most salient sign being the UK’s impending departure from the EU. After Brexit, the WTO will probably become an important forum for Britain’s trade relations with the world. Any further disintegration of the EU will only bolster that trend. Of course, it is possible that regional trade agreements in Asia and elsewhere will continue to flourish. But new leadership would have to emerge. And no single systemically important country today meets the rigorous requirements of such leadership: internal political stability, economic dynamism, relatively contained risk, and a steadfast commitment to open markets. However counterintuitive that may sound, a second development that bodes well for the WTO’s revival is voters’ increasing rejection of hyper-globalization. Hyper-globalization is essentially “deep” integration. It goes beyond creating open markets for goods and services to include increased immigration (in the US and Europe), harmonizing regulations (the ambition of the TPP and the TTIP), and intrusive adjudication of domestic policies (the investor-settlement procedures under NAFTA and the TPP). In the EU’s case, it even entails a common currency. For such integration, regionalism is much more effective than the WTO. Now that “deep” is out, the WTO could once again become an attractive forum for trading countries to do business. Make no mistake: there will still be a lot of globalization for the WTO to facilitate and manage, not least because of the inexorable march of technology. The mesh-like structure of trade and investment connecting countries, embodied in global value-chains – what Aaditya Mattoo of the World Bank and I have called “criss-crossing globalization” – will prevent significant backsliding. The third development that could reinvigorate the WTO is a more protectionist stance by the Trump administration. If the US raises tariffs or implements a border-adjustment tax favoring exports and penalizing imports, its trade partners are likely to turn to the WTO for adjudication, given the organization’s demonstrated dispute-settlement capability. The WTO could, therefore, become the place where US trade policies are scrutinized and kept in check. The universality of WTO membership, previously seen as an impediment to countries eager to move ahead with new rules and agreements, could be its main strength, as it implies a high degree of legitimacy, which is essential to minimize trade tensions and the risk of conflict. In my book Eclipse, I argued that multilateralism offered the best means for ensuring the peaceful rise of new powers. But it seems that the same argument could apply equally well to the management of receding powers. But the WTO’s revival will not happen automatically. Willing stakeholders must actively pursue it. The most obvious candidates for the job are the mid-size economies that have been the greatest beneficiary of globalization, and that, unlike the US and some European countries, are not currently under pressure from a globalization-averse public. The champions of multilateralism should include Australia, Brazil, India, Indonesia, Mexico, New Zealand, South Africa, the United Kingdom, and possibly China and Japan. Because none of them is large (with the exception of China), they must work collectively to defend open markets. Moreover, they must open their own markets not only in the traditional areas of agriculture and manufacturing, but also in new areas such as services, investments, and standards. In doing so, these countries would also be responding to the increasingly transactional approach to sustaining openness that the larger traders are being compelled to adopt. The world needs a robust response to the decline of hyper-globalization. Multilateralism, championed by mid-size trading economies with a strong interest in preserving openness, may be it. To the shores of Leman they must now head.",
            "世贸组织重生？ 新德里—世界贸易组织已经黯然失色了太长时间，用艾略特的话说，是因为“莱曼之水 ” （ 日内瓦湖 ） 。 作为昔日杰出的多边贸易论坛，世贸组织在最近几年逐渐被边缘化，而最近对全球化的反动 — — 如英国的退欧公投和特朗普当选美国总统 — — 表明这一趋势还将加速。 但这些结果实际上可能起到相反的效果，因为三个重要发展态势可能让世贸组织 — — 以及它所代表的多边主义 — — 重塑昔日辉煌。 第一个发展态势是替代性贸易安排的式微。 世贸组织在21世纪初达到顶峰，当是时，全球贸易谈判乌拉圭回合刚刚在几年前结束，更多的国家 — — 最引人注目的是中国 — — 答应加入该组织。 但美国和欧盟等主要贸易方随后将注意力从多边贸易协定转向了双边、地区和大地区协议。 大地区协议 — — 即跨太平洋合作伙伴关系（TPP）和跨大西洋贸易和投资伙伴关系（TTIP ） — —给世贸组织造成了特别巨大的威胁。 但特朗普政府正是要和这些协议说“不 ” ， 至少要将它们搁置起来。 欧洲一体化也对世贸组织造成了类似的影响，因为它提供了一个新的管理欧洲内部贸易的平台。 但欧洲工程已经步履维艰，英国即将脱离欧盟就是明证。 英国退欧之后，世贸组织也许将成为英国与世界贸易关系的重要论坛。 欧盟的进一步解体都将强化这一趋势。 当然，有可能亚洲和其他地方的地区贸易协定仍将继续兴盛。 但必须出现新的领导者。 而如今没有一个具有系统重要性的国家可以单枪匹马满足这一领导力的严格要求：内政稳定、经济有活力，风险相对受控，坚定致力于开放市场。 听起来似乎与直觉相反，第二个可以作为世贸组织复兴之福的发展态势是越来越多的选民开始拒绝超全球化（hyper-globalization ） 。 超全球化从本质上即“深度”一体化。 它不仅包括为商品和服务创造开放市场以容纳更多的移民（在美国和欧洲 ） 、 调和监管（TPP和TTIP的雄心）和对国内政策侵略式裁判（北美贸易自由协定和TPP规定的投资者和解程序 ） 。 在欧盟的例子中，它甚至包括了共同货币。 对于这样的一体化，再地区化远比世贸组织更有效。 如今 ， “ 深度”已是明日黄花，世贸组织有望重新成为有吸引力的论坛，为各贸易国提供生意机会。 不要搞错了：因为技术的无情的进步，世贸组织仍要为全球化提供大量便利和管理。 贸易和投资的网状结构将各国联系在一起，嵌入全球价值链 — — 世界银行的阿迪特亚·马图（Aaditya Mattoo）和我称之为“十字交叉全球化 ” — —这能够防止大溃败。 第三个有望重振世贸组织的发展态势是特朗普政府所采取了更加保护主义的立场。 如果美国提高关税，或征收边境调节税以奖励出口、惩罚进口，其贸易伙伴可能转向世贸组织要求作出裁决，因为该组织拥有经过了证明的纠纷解决能力。 因此，世贸组织有望成为美国贸易政策得到检查和制约的场合。 世贸组织成员的普遍性曾经被视为渴望采取新规则和协定的国家的一大障碍，现在可能成为其主要优势，因为这意味着很高的合法性，而这是贸易紧张和冲突风险最小化的关键。 在我的书《日蚀 》 （ Eclipse）中，我指出多边主义提供了确保新力量和平崛起的最佳方式。 但似乎同样的观点也适用于管理衰落力量。 但世贸组织的复兴不会自动发生。 有意愿的相关利益方必须积极追求这一结果。 最显而易见的候选者是已是全球化最大受益者的中等规模经济体，以及 — — 不同于美国和一些欧洲国家 — — 目前未受到讨厌全球化的公众的压力的经济体。 多边主义的主力军应该包括澳大利亚、巴西、印度、印尼、墨西哥、新西兰、南非和英国，可能还有中国和日本。 由于它们都不是大经济体（中国除外 ） ， 因此它们必须团结起来捍卫开放市场。 此外，它们必须开放资深市场，不仅包括农业和制造业等传统领域，也包括服务业、投资和标准等新领域。 如此，这些国家也可以对应日益交易性的、保持大贸易方被迫采取的开放的方法。 世界需要强力面对超全球化的衰落。 能从保护开放性中获得重大利益的中型贸易经济体所引领的多边主义或许是应对方法之一。 它们必须抵达莱曼之水的彼岸。"

            "Forget the Vaccine Patent Waiver NEW HAVEN – The surge of COVID-19 cases and deaths in India shows that the pandemic is far from over. While most developing countries in Asia and Africa managed to keep their death tolls low over the past year, it is only a matter of time before the new, more contagious variants that have emerged in India and elsewhere spread to countries that seemed to have their infections under control. Absent a miracle – such as a mutation that renders the virus less lethal – only universal vaccination can end this cycle of misery. With that goal in mind, a global movement has emerged to demand a World Trade Organization waiver of patent protections for COVID-19 vaccines (as well as treatments and diagnostics). But patent protections are not the primary cause of the vaccine-supply bottleneck. If anything, a waiver might divert scarce materials from vaccine production facilities that are already up and running, not to mention discourage investments in pharmaceuticals to ward off future pandemics. Intellectual-property protection for pharmaceuticals has a long, uncomfortable history, especially in developing countries. When the WTO Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) was signed in 1995, an overwhelming majority of economists – including those strongly in favor of free trade – condemned it. They objected to an agreement that obliges all WTO member states to recognize and enforce patents in all fields of technology, including pharmaceuticals. While the case for general patent protection has a strong foundation in economic principles, there is no rationale for harmonizing patent protection across rich and poor countries. As I argued in 2010, the pharmaceutical industry at the time was losing only a tiny sliver of its profits from patent infringements in developing countries. And worse, IP enforcement could result in lost or delayed access to life-saving medicines in countries that would no longer be able to produce or import generic versions of patented drugs. Against this historical backdrop, the demand for a COVID-19 patent waiver is understandable. The problem is that the underlying issues have changed fundamentally. As a recent World Bank working paper by Ruchir Agarwal and Tristan Reed finds, “production capacity for vaccines does not appear to be the binding constraint” in global procurement. After all, there are now at least ten COVID-19 vaccines with a demonstrated efficacy above 50% (the threshold set by the US Federal Drug Administration in its June 30, 2020, “guidance for industry”). Though efficacy varies across vaccines and variants tested, all of the vaccines being administered provide significant protection against hospitalization and death. Moreover, the ten companies producing them have production targets for 2021 that would be sufficient to vaccinate 93% of the world population. What’s the issue, then? According to Agarwal and Reed, it is that companies are reluctant to activate their existing production capacity without pre-purchase commitments. There is currently a large gap between the number of doses that could be produced and the number that have been pre-ordered. And, as one would expect, this gap is unevenly distributed. High-income countries have ordered more doses than they need and thus will end up with a surplus, whereas lower-income countries are far behind in pre-purchasing vaccines. Under these circumstances, efforts to increase capacity by relaxing patent protections would do nothing to accelerate vaccinations in lower-income countries. A far more promising strategy is to help lower-income countries purchase vaccines, while channeling surplus doses from richer countries to wherever they are needed most. To a large extent, this strategy is already being implemented, thanks to the efforts of the COVAX Advanced Market Commitment facility, together with concessional loans by multilateral institutions such as the World Bank, and regional initiatives such as the one being led by the African Union. Remarkably, Agarwal and Reed show that the COVAX AMC facility and the AU initiative already have ensured that most African countries have ordered enough vaccines to cover at least 50% of their populations. Still, three critical challenges remain. First, closing the pre-purchase gap of 350 million vaccines will requires an additional $4 billion – a trivial cost relative to the potential benefit of achieving worldwide immunity. Providing this support, either through additional funding for the COVAX AMC facility or by sending surplus vaccines to developing countries as soon as possible, should not be too difficult or costly for high-income countries to manage. Second, the World Bank needs to relax its conditions for extending loans for vaccine pre-purchases. Currently, such loans can be used only for vaccines approved by three stringent regulatory authorities (SRAs) in three different regions. Among these are Japan and certain Western countries, which naturally prioritize approval of vaccines intended for their own populations. They have little incentive to grant emergency-use authorization to alternative vaccines that have shown high efficacy in Phase 3 clinical trials, such as Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin (India), and Gamaleya’s Sputnik V (Russia), and Sinovac Biotech’s CoronaVac (China). Extending the list of national regulators classified as SRAs would go a long way toward increasing lending for vaccine purchases. Finally, existing vaccine manufacturers will be unable to meet their production targets if vaccine nationalism gives rise to export restrictions on critical inputs and raw materials. We saw such behavior early in the pandemic with respect to personal protective equipment, but the resulting export restrictions proved short-lived. One hopes the same will be true for vaccines. International cooperation and coordination will be crucial in the coming months. There are many ways for advanced economies to assist poorer countries in vaccinating their populations as soon as possible. But relaxing patent protections – however appealing the idea may be in other contexts – is not one of them. The focus should be on providing additional funding and less restrictive lending for pre-ordering vaccines, and on funneling surpluses from high-income countries to the rest of the world.",
            "忘记疫苗专利豁免 纽黑文—印度新冠病例和死亡人数的激增表明，这场疫情还远未结束。 虽然亚洲和非洲的大多数发展中国家在过去一年里设法保持了较低的死亡人数，但已在印度和其他地方出现的传染性更强的新变种蔓延到似乎已控制住传染的国家只是时间问题。 如果没有奇迹 — — 比如发生降低病毒杀伤力的突变 — — 那么只有全民接种疫苗才能结束这一痛苦循环。 带着这一目标，出现了一场全球运动要求世界贸易组织 放弃 对新冠疫苗（以及治疗和诊断）的专利保护。 但专利保护并不是疫苗供应的主要瓶颈。 豁免倒是可能会转移已开足马力运转的疫苗生产中的稀缺材料，更有可能阻碍药品投资以抵御未来疫情。 药品的知识产权保护向来令人不快，特别是在发展中国家。 1995年世贸组织签署《贸易相关知识产权协定 》 （ TRIPS）时，绝大多数经济学家 — — 包括那些强烈支持自由贸易的经济学家 — — 表示谴责。 他们反对协定要求所有世贸组织成员国承认和强制执行包括药品在内的所有技术领域的专利。 虽然通用专利保护的理由在经济学原理上理由充分，但调和富国和穷国之间的专利保护决非理性。 我在 2010年指出，当时的制药业因发展中国家的专利侵权所造成的损失微乎其微。 更糟的是，知识产权执法可能导致不再能够生产或进口仿制专利药的国家失去或延迟获得救命药物的机会。 在这一历史背景下，要求新冠专利豁免是可以理解的。 问题在于根本问题已经发生了根本性的变化。 鲁奇尔·阿加瓦尔（Ruchir Agarwal）和特里斯坦·里德（Tristan Reed）最近发表的世界银行工作论文发现 ， \" 疫苗产能似乎并不是全球采购的约束因素 \" 。 毕竟，现在至少有10种新冠疫苗的证实效果超过50 % （ 美国联邦药品管理局在其2020年6月30日的\"行业指南\"中所设定的门槛 ， ） 。 不同疫苗和测试变株的效果各不相同，但所有正在接种的疫苗都为住院和死亡提供了重大保护。 此外，生产这些疫苗的10家公司的2021年生产目标足以为世界93%的人口接种疫苗。 那有什么问题？ 根据阿加瓦尔和里德的说法，在没有预购承诺的情况下，公司不愿意激活其现有产能。 目前，可生产的剂量数量与已预购的剂量之间存在巨大差距。 而且，正如人们所料，这种差距分布不均。 高收入国家订购的疫苗远高于需要量，因此会有疫苗盈余，而低收入国家在预先购买疫苗方面远远落后。 在这种情况下，通过放宽专利保护来提高能力的努力无助于加快低收入国家的疫苗接种。 一项更有希望的战略是帮助低收入国家购买疫苗，同时将盈余剂量从较富裕国家输送到最需要的地方。 在很大程度上，由于COVAX高级市场承诺（AMC）机制的努力，再加上世界银行等多边机构的优惠贷款，以及非洲联盟领导的区域倡议等计划，这一战略已经得到执行。 值得注意的是，阿加瓦尔和里德表明，COVAX AMC机制和非盟倡议已经确保大多数非洲国家订购了足够的疫苗覆盖至少50%的人口。 尽管如此，仍然存在三个关键挑战。 首先，要缩小3.5亿支疫苗的预购缺口，还需要40亿美元 — — 相对于实现全球免疫的潜在好处，这一成本微不足道。 对于高收入国家来说，不管是通过为COVAX AMC机制提供额外资金，还是通过尽快向发展中国家提供盈余疫苗来提供这种支持，管理起来应该不会太困难或太昂贵。 第二，世界银行需要放宽其提供疫苗预购贷款的条件。 目前，此类贷款只能用于三个不同地区的三个严格监管机构（SRAs）批准的疫苗。 其中包括日本和某些西方国家，它们自然优先批准针对本国人口的疫苗。 他们几乎没有动力向在第三阶段临床试验中显示出高疗效的替代疫苗颁发紧急使用授权，如巴拉特生物技术公司（Bharat Biotech）的科瓦辛疫苗（印度 ） 、 伽马利娅（Gamaleya）的斯普特尼克五号疫苗（俄罗斯）和科兴中维的的克尔来福疫苗（中国 ） 。 扩大SRA的国家监管机构名单将大大增加疫苗购买贷款。 最后，如果疫苗民族主义导致对关键投入和原材料的出口限制，现有疫苗制造商将无法实现生产目标。 我们在疫情初期的个人防护设备领域见过这一幕，但由此产生的出口限制非常短暂。 但愿疫苗也是如此。 国际合作与协调在今后几个月中将至关重要。 发达经济体有许多方法可以帮助较贫穷国家尽快为其人口接种疫苗。 但是，放松专利保护 — — 无论这种想法在其他情况下多么吸引人 — — 并不是其中之一。 重点应放在为预购疫苗提供额外资金和限制性较小的贷款，以及将高收入国家的盈余疫苗输送到世界其他地区。"

            "Putin on Parade NEW YORK – This May’s parade in Moscow to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II promises to be the greatest Victory Day celebration since the Soviet Union’s collapse. Some 16,000 soldiers, 200 armored vehicles, and 150 planes and helicopters are set to pass through and over Red Square. It will be a scene that would easily have been familiar to Soviet leaders like Leonid Brezhnev and Nikita Khrushchev, taking the salute atop Lenin’s tomb. Yet, though Russia’s WWII allies were from Europe and North America, no Western leaders will attend the commemoration – a reflection of the West’s disapproval of Putin’s invasion of Ukraine and annexation of Crimea. Instead, Russian President Vladimir Putin’s high-profile guests will include the leaders of China, India, and North Korea, underscoring just how few friends Russia has these days. The surreal nature of this gathering reflects the increasingly bizarre nature of Putin’s regime. Indeed, watching Russia nowadays is like watching the last installment of the X-Men film franchise, “Days of Future Past.” Just as the X-Men in that film join forces with their younger selves to save mankind’s future, today’s Kremlin is harking back to Russia’s Soviet past in what it sees as a contemporary fight for the country’s survival. Critical to this strategy is propaganda conflating the West today with the Germans who invaded Russia in 1941, while painting Ukrainian government officials as “fascists” and “neo-Nazis.” The Kremlin has relied on such claims, together with the supposed need to defend Russians abroad, to justify its aggression against Ukraine. In Putin’s speech following the annexation of Crimea, he charged that the West’s refusal “to engage in dialogue” left Russia with no choice. “We are constantly proposing cooperation on all key issues,” he declared. “We want to strengthen our level of trust and for our relations to be equal, open, and fair. But we saw no reciprocal steps.” A month later, Putin reinforced this image of Russians as the morally superior victims of a cruel and uncompromising West. “We are less pragmatic than other people, less calculating,” he asserted, before adding that Russia’s “greatness” and “vast size” means “we have a more generous heart.” It is not difficult to see the parallels between Putin’s approach and that of Joseph Stalin, who declared at the start of WWII that the “enemy” aims to “destroy” Russia’s “national culture,” to “Germanize” its people, and “convert them into slaves.” The difference, of course, is that the Nazi Wehrmacht actually invaded the Soviet Union, whereas Ukraine simply wanted to decide its own future. Without defending Stalin, one must recognize the immense Soviet contribution – including the lives of 26 million citizens – to the Allied victory in WWII. At the time, the military parade in Red Square – featuring almost 35,000 troops, up to 1,900 pieces of military equipment, and a 1,400-man orchestra – was a well-deserved pageant. The Soviet leadership spared no cost in staging its military displays, which, in the absence of an external military threat, became an important vehicle for rallying national unity. After the Soviet Union’s collapse, Russia, no longer a superpower, put its military spectacles on ice. But in 2005, to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the end of WWII, Putin held a major parade – one that Western leaders, believing that Russia might have a European future, did attend. The tone of this year’s Victory Day commemorations is far less anticipatory. How can one celebrate the end of a war at a time when the descendants of those who fought it (undoubtedly driven by the hope that future generations would live in peace) are killing one another in a brutal little war in eastern Ukraine? What is the point of grandiose fireworks displays amid the firing of real howitzers and rockets? The historian Robert Paxton believed that one could tell much about a country by its parades. His 1966 book Parades and Politics at Vichy describes how Philippe Pétain, as Chief of State of Vichy France, used pageantry, reactionary politics, and, of course, a partnership with Adolf Hitler to dupe his defeated country into believing that it still mattered in the world. The Vichy state’s brand of authoritarian traditionalism lionized family and fatherland, with Pétain, a former military commander, serving as a kind of military king, exalted on the tribune. The parallels with Putin’s Russia are clear. Putin views himself as a new czar. His KGB background dictates his leadership style, which includes the abolition of free and fair elections, the persecution of opponents, and the promotion of conservative values that he, like Pétain before him, juxtaposes with the corrupting influence of an “immoral” and “decadent” West. Relying on this approach, Putin has built alliances with the likes of Syria’s President Bashar al-Assad and Egypt’s military ruler Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. China, the world’s second largest economy, is a useful addition to this collection of friendly anti-democratic states, as it has its own strategic grievances with the West. Unlike China, however, Russia is not a rising superpower. Putin may try to portray his actions in Ukraine as a fight against fascism. But it is really a fight for relevance – a fight he will never win. No matter how grand the parade, he cannot hide the truth: Russia’s days as a superpower are in the past. Putin’s patriotism, like Pétain’s, is that of the vanquished.",
            "游行中的普京 纽约 — — 今年五月即将在莫斯科举行的二战结束70周年纪念游行有望成为苏联解体以来规模最大的胜利日庆祝活动。 大约16,000名士兵、200辆装甲车和150架飞机和直升机将穿越红场地面和上空。 勃列日涅夫和赫鲁晓夫等苏联领导人曾非常熟悉向红场列宁墓致敬的场景。 但虽然俄罗斯二战盟国均来自欧洲和北美，但西方领导人却不会出席纪念活动 — — 这是西方对普京入侵乌克兰及吞并克里米亚不满的反映。 相反，俄总统弗拉基米尔·普京的高规格嘉宾包括中国、印度和朝鲜领导人，这凸显了当今俄国鲜有同盟的孤立环境。 此次超现实主义聚会是普京政权怪诞现实的反映。 事实上，看现在的俄罗斯就像在看最后一集X战警《未来昔日 》 。 正像影片中的X战警与年轻的自己联手拯救人类未来一样，今天的克里姆林宫正试图借助过去苏联的力量来打赢俄罗斯的现代生存战争。 上述战略的关键是将今天的西方与1941年入侵俄国的德国混为一谈，同时把乌克兰政府官员描绘成“法西斯”和“新纳粹分子 ” 。 克里姆林正是依靠这样的说法和保护海外俄国人的所谓必要性来为侵略乌克兰寻找借口。 在吞并克里米亚后的讲话中，普京指责西方国家拒绝“参与对话”令俄罗斯别无选择。 普京称“我们不断在所有关键问题上寻求合作 ” 。 “我们希望强化信任，让关系平等、开放、公正。 但我们没有看到西方采取相应的步骤。 一个月后，普京再次强调俄罗斯是残酷且拒绝妥协的西方在道德上具有优越感的受害者。 普京称“我们不像其他人那么务实算计 ” ， 他还补充说俄罗斯的“伟大”和“广阔疆域”让我们“更加大度和宽容 ” 。 不难看出普京和斯大林的做法有相似之处，后者曾在二战伊始宣布“敌人”想要“消灭”俄罗斯“民族文化 ” 、 将俄国人“德国化”并奴役俄国民众。 当然，不同之处是德国国防军的确入侵了苏联，而乌克兰不过想要主宰自己的命运。 即使一点不为斯大林辩护，人们也必须承认苏联对二战盟军胜利的巨大贡献 — — 包括2，600万民众为此献出生命。 当时的红场阅兵 — — 约有步兵35，000人、军事装备1，900件、乐队1，400人 — — 可谓一场当之无愧的盛宴。 苏联领导层不遗余力地展示军力，那次阅兵在没有外来军事威胁的情况下，成为凝聚民族团结的重要手段。 ��联解体后，俄罗斯不再是超级大国，也因此暂停举办阅兵式。 但2005年，为纪念二战结束60周年，普京举办了盛大阅兵式 — — 当时西方领导人相信俄罗斯未来可能加入欧洲，并因此出席了那次阅兵式。 今年胜利日纪念活动的气氛远不及预期。 怎么能在战争英雄（推动他们打这场战争的是希望子孙后代能够和平生活）后代在东乌克兰残酷的局部战争中互相残杀的情况下庆祝战争的胜利？ 在榴弹炮和火箭纷飞之际宏伟的烟花表演能有什么意义？ 历史学家罗伯特·帕克斯顿相信游行能在很大程度上反映国家的面貌。 他1996年的著作《维希的游行和政治》讲述了担任法国维希政府首脑的菲利普·贝当用华丽、反动的政治策略，当然还有与希特勒的联盟来欺骗战败的祖国，让其相信自己在世界事务中仍有一席之地。 作为维希政府标志的专制传统主义让家族和祖国流芳千古，而前军事指挥官贝当则扮演着某种军事王者的角色，并被抬上神圣的讲坛。 维希政府与普京领导下俄罗斯的相似之处显而易见。 普京以新沙皇自居。 他的克格勃背景决定了他的领导风格，包括取消自由公正选举，迫害反对派以及宣传保守的价值观。 就像曾经的贝当一样 ， “ 非道德”和“颓废”的西方腐败深深影响着普京。 依靠这种方法，普京已与叙利亚总统巴沙尔·阿萨德和埃及军事统治者阿卜杜勒·法塔赫·塞西结成联盟。 全世界第二大经济体中国因为有其自身对西方的战略不满，成为对友好反民主国家联盟的有益补充。 但不同于中国的是，俄罗斯并不是崛起中的超级大国。 普京可能想把乌克兰行动描绘成一场反法西斯斗争。 但它实际是争夺影响力的战斗 — — 在这场战斗中他根本不可能获胜。 无论阅兵式多么盛大都无法掩盖真相：俄罗斯作为超级大国的历史已经一去不复返。 普京的爱国主义像贝当一样属于被征服者。"

            "The Closing of the Chinese Mind WASHINGTON, DC – Lou Jiwei may not be a household name in the West, but the former Chinese finance minister is well known and highly respected among financiers and economic policymakers. Yet, earlier this month, China’s government announced Lou’s dismissal from his post as chairman of the country’s national social security fund. The move reflects a change in the Chinese leadership’s approach to governance that is likely to have profound implications for the country’s future. The removal of Lou from his post represents a break from precedent: his three predecessors served 4.5 years, on average, and all retired after reaching 69. The 68-year-old Lou served for only a little over two years. China’s leaders did not provide a reason for sacking him, but a likely explanation stands out. Lou has recently emerged as an outspoken critic of China’s ambitious industrial policy agenda, Made in China 2025, calling it a waste of public money. Made in China 2025 had already aroused suspicion among China’s Western trading partners. They view the program as an effort by China to use unfair means – namely, government support for strategic sectors – to displace the West as the world’s leader in advanced technologies. The scheme was one of the factors that precipitated US President Donald Trump’s trade war with China. Since the trade war erupted, China’s leaders have deliberately toned down the hype surrounding Made in China 2025, suggesting that they recognize the high cost of moving forward with the program. In this context, Lou’s criticism is not particularly scandalous – unless, of course, China’s leaders are merely pretending to back off the policy until trade tensions ease. But the implications of Lou’s dismissal extend beyond Made in China 2025. Lou is a hard-charging reformer with an illustrious record of accomplishments. His dismissal underscores the extent to which, under President Xi Jinping’s leadership, China’s government has become intolerant of even the slightest internal policy disagreements, even on the subject of economics, which used to be debated quite openly among the leadership. It is an approach that could well prove disastrous. Since Xi came to power in 2012, decision-making processes at the top level of the Communist Party of China (CPC) have been changed beyond recognition. Previously, collective leadership allowed dissenting views to be aired, and decisions were reached largely by consensus – a slow process that sometimes resulted in missed opportunities. But it was also an important risk-management mechanism. Openness to a variety of perspectives helped ensure that impractical or dangerous ideas were rejected, and the CPC made no catastrophic policy mistakes under Xi’s two predecessors, Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao. Xi, however, has replaced collective decision-making with centralized leadership. The space for legitimate differences of opinion has been crowded out by the expectation of political loyalty and conformity. In fact, the CPC has effectively criminalized voicing opinions that are at odds with the top leadership’s stance. That offense – called wangyi zhongyang, or “recklessly speaking about the party center” – probably played a larger role than actual wrongdoing in Xi’s crackdown on official corruption in recent years. The resulting lack of constructive opposition means that excessively risky or inadequately considered ideas can become national policies in Xi’s China. And so they have: in the last five years, China has made several major policy mistakes, owing to inadequate internal debate. One such mistake was the hasty decision in the summer of 2015 to use public funds to support equity prices when markets plunged. That policy failed to stabilize prices, wasted trillions of renminbi, and weakened the credibility of China’s new leaders. Another major policy mistake was China’s construction of artificial islands in the South China Sea and subsequent installation of military facilities on them. This might have seemed like a smart strategic move to some in Xi’s government. But, by giving the impression that China is intent on dominating East Asia through coercion, it was a major factor contributing to the rapid deterioration of China’s relations with the United States. Similarly, beyond being economically dubious, Xi’s massive Belt and Road Initiative – featuring more than $1 trillion in planned infrastructure investment in Eurasia and beyond – stoked Western suspicions about China’s geopolitical agenda. This mistake has ended up hurting relations not just with the US, but also with key allies, which view China’s involvement in developing countries – and, thus, their own relations with China – with deepening unease. If the CPC continues to adhere to centralized decision-making, more – and more calamitous – mistakes are likely. China’s leaders could, for example, decide to attack Taiwan, risking a catastrophic war with the US. In such a situation, one can only hope that, somewhere in the government, there is still a bold figure like Lou willing to stand up to express dissent.",
            "中国思想的封闭 华盛顿—楼继伟这个名字在西方未必家喻户晓，但这位中国前财政部长在金融家和经济决策者中间也算得上知名且广受尊敬。 但是，本月早些时候，中国政府宣布楼继伟被免去国家社保基金主席的职务。 这一决定反映了中国领导层治理方针的变化，有可能给中国未来造成深远影响。 楼继伟被免职与前任的轨迹不符：他的三位前任平均在任4.5年，都在69岁退休。 68岁的楼继伟只上任了两年出头。 中国领导人没有为他被免职提供理由，但一种可能的解释显而易见。 楼继伟最近公开批评中国雄心勃勃的产业政策日程中国制造2025，说它纯属浪费公帑。 中国制造2025引起了中国的西方贸易伙伴的怀疑。 它们将该计划视为中国准备用不公平手段 — — 即政府支持战略性行业 — — 取代西方的先进科技领导者地位。 该计划也是美国总统特朗普对中国开展贸易战的因素之一。 贸易战爆发后，中国领导人有意低调处理围绕中国制造2025的喧嚣，表示他们认识到推进该计划的高昂代价。 在这样的背景下，楼继伟的批评并不显得特别令人震惊 — — 当然，除非中国领导人只是装装服软的样子，为了熬过贸易紧张。 但楼继伟被免职的影响不仅限于中国制造2025。 楼继伟是一位积极进取的改革家，成就满满。 他的免职突出地表明，在国家主席习近平的领导下，中国政府已经连最轻微的内部政策分析也容不下，哪怕是在过去往往可以在领导层中间公开争论的经济政策方面。 这一方针很有可能到来灾难性后果。 自2012年习近平上台后，中共顶层决策过程变化之大令人咋舌。 此前，集体领导使得不同意见能够传播，决策主要通过共识形成 — — 这一过程比较缓慢，有时候会造成机会流失。 但这也是一个重要的风险管理机制。 开放接受各种角度有助于确保不切实际或危险的思维被拒绝，在习近平的两位前任江泽民和胡锦涛上台期间，中国也没有出现过灾难性政策错误。 但是，习近平用集权领导取代了集体决策。 观念的合理分歧空间被政治忠诚和合格挤压。 事实上，中国实际上已将与最高领导层立场不同的观点声音罪名化。 这种冒犯 — — 被称为“妄议中央 ” — —所起到的作用可能比中国官员们在最近几年的反腐运动中所披露出的实际错误更加严重。 由此导致的建设性反对意见缺失意味着在习近平的中国，风险过高或考虑不周的思想可能变成国家政策。 确实如此：在过去五年中，中国犯了多个重大政策错误，原因就在于内部争论不足。 错误之一是2015年夏市场崩盘时匆忙决定用公共资金支持股价。 该政策没能稳定价格，浪费了数万亿人民币，也影响了中国新领导人的信誉。 另一个重大政策错误是中国在南海建造人工岛，并在上面安装军事设施。 对习近平政府中的一些人来说，这似乎是明智的战略性举动。 但这让人觉得中国意图通过高压主宰东亚，也是中国与美国关系急剧恶化的主要因素之一。 类似地，习近平的一带一路计划 — — 计划在欧亚和其他地区投入1万多亿美元建设基础设施 — — 除了在经济上颇有可疑，也让西方怀疑中国的地缘政治日程。 这一错误最终不但危害了与美国的关系，也影响到了与重要盟友的关系，他们日益不安地看着中国涉足发展中国家 — — 进而它们自身与中国的关系。 如果中共继续坚持集中化决策，更多 — — 后果也更严重 — — 的错误有可能还会发生。 比如，中国领导人可能会决定武力攻击台湾，这有可能造成与美国的灾难性战争。 在这一情形中，我们只能希望中国政府中还有像楼继伟这样勇敢的人物站出来表达不同意见。"

            "Can Xi End China's Gilded Age? ANN ARBOR – Within the span of a generation, a new super-rich class emerges from a society in which millions of rural migrants toiled away in factories for a pittance. Bribery becomes the most common mode of influence in politics. Opportunists speculate recklessly in land and real estate. Financial risks simmer as local governments borrow to finance railways and other large infrastructure projects. And all of this is happening in the world’s most promising emerging market and rising global power. No, this is not a description of contemporary China, but rather of the United States during the Gilded Age (roughly 1870 to 1900). This formative period of American capitalism is remembered as “Gilded,” rather than “Golden,” because beneath the veneer of rapid industrialization and economic growth, many problems festered. Public backlashes against the Gilded Age triggered wide-ranging economic and social reforms that ushered in the Progressive Era (approximately 1890s-1920s). This domestic revolution, along with imperial acquisitions abroad, paved the way for America’s rise as the superpower of the twentieth century. China is currently passing through a similar – though certainly not identical – phase. After coming to power in 2012 during China’s own Gilded Age, President Xi Jinping now presides over a country that is far wealthier than the one ruled by his predecessors. But Xi also must confront a host of problems that come with a middle-income, crony-capitalist economy, not least corruption. As he warned in his maiden speech to the Politburo in 2012, corruption “will inevitably doom the Party and the state.” Over the past few decades, China’s economy has soared alongside a particular type of venality: elite exchanges of power and wealth, or what I term “access money.” Beginning in the 2000s, the incidence of embezzlement and petty extortion fell as the government built up its monitoring capacity and enthusiastically welcomed investors. But high-stakes graft exploded as politically connected capitalists plied politicians with lavish bribes in exchange for lucrative privileges. Along with cronyism came rising inequality. Since the 1980s, income inequality has risen faster in China than in the US. China’s Gini coefficient (a standard measure of income inequality) exceeded America’s in 2012. And Chinese wealth inequality is even wider than income inequality, because those who accumulated assets during the early growth stages realized enormous gains. A third problem is systemic financial risks. In 2020, the finance ministry warned that local governmental debt was approaching 100% of all revenues combined. If local governments default, the banks and financial institutions that loaned them massive sums will be exposed, potentially setting off a chain reaction. And it is not just government finances that are in trouble. China’s second-largest property developer, Evergrande, is $300 billion in debt and nearing insolvency. These simmering crises should not be viewed in isolation; rather, they are interconnected parts of China’s Gilded Age. Corruption in the form of access money spurred government officials to promote construction and investment aggressively, regardless of whether it was sustainable. Luxury properties that enriched colluding state and business elites have mushroomed across the country, while affordable housing remains in short supply. Those with political connections and wealth have easily reaped outsize profits through speculative investment. Likewise, in the digital economy, what was once a free-for-all arena has consolidated around a few titans that can easily crush smaller players. Factory workers are being replaced by gig workers who toil long hours with scant labor protections. Fed up with excessive materialism and the rat race in society, young people are protesting by “lying flat” (ceasing to strive). The decadence of China’s Gilded Age poses multiple threats for Xi. Corruption, inequality, and financial meltdowns can trigger social unrest and erode the legitimacy of the Communist Party of China, given its promise of equality and justice. These problems – particularly elite corruption, which enriches rival factions – all undermine Xi’s personal hold on power. Thus, Xi is determined to take China out of its Gilded Age, both to save the CPC and to cement his own legacy as the leader who will deliver the Party’s “original mission.” Whereas Deng Xiaoping aspired to make China rich, Xi wants to make China clean and fair as well. In the last two months, Western investors have abruptly awoken to Xi’s calls for “common prosperity.” But Xi’s socialist mission actually began in 2012, when he vowed to eliminate rural poverty and simultaneously launched the largest anti-corruption drive in the CPC’s history. Xi has maintained these campaigns despite the pandemic, and he proudly proclaimed in 2020 that his poverty alleviation targets were achieved on schedule. More recently, these campaigns have extended into a wave of regulatory crackdowns on Big Tech companies, bans on private tutoring, caps on housing prices, and a clampdown on rich celebrities. To top it off, Xi has personally exhorted the rich to share their wealth with society. America’s Gilded Age provides a historical lens for making sense of Xi’s actions. All crony-capitalist economies, no matter how fast-growing, eventually run into limits. If American history is any guide, the problems facing China today do not necessarily spell doom. Much depends on what policymakers do next. If the problems are tackled appropriately, China, too, can move from risky, unbalanced growth to higher-quality development. But whereas the American Progressive Era relied on democratic measures to fight crony capitalism – for example, through political activism and a “muckraking” free press that exposed corruption – Xi is attempting to summon China’s own Progressive Era through command and control. The world has yet to witness a government successfully overcome the side effects of capitalism by decree. Decades earlier, Mao Zedong tried to command rapid industrialization and failed disastrously. The lesson is that because top-down orders can and do backfire, they must not be relied upon as the solution to all problems. If excessively and arbitrarily applied, bans and edicts will diminish investor confidence in Chinese leaders’ commitment to rules-based markets. Progressivism in America laid the domestic foundation for the country’s international primacy in the twentieth century. Whether Xi can order China out of the Gilded Age will determine the continuity of China’s rise in the twenty-first.",
            "习近平能否结束中国的镀金时代？ 安娜堡—仅仅用了一代人的时间，一个新的超级富豪阶层崛起，与此同时，还有数百万农民工为了微薄的收入在工厂里辛勤工作。 贿赂成为影响政治的一种最常见的模式。 机会主义者肆无忌惮地进行土地和房地产投机。 由于地方政府通过借贷来资助铁路和其他大型基础设施项目的建设，金融风险不断增加。 而这一切都发生在一个世界上最有前景的新兴市场，一个正在崛起的世界强国。 猜错了。 我描述的并不是当代中国，而是镀金时代的美国（大约在1870年至1900年 ） 。 人们用“镀金”而非“黄金”来形容美国资本主义这一形成时期，是因为在快速工业化和经济增长的表象之下，许多问题正在恶化。 美国民众对镀金时代的反对引发了广泛的经济和社会改革，开创了进步时代（约1890年代至 1920年代 ） 。 这场美国国内的革命和美国在海外的收购一同使美国一跃成为二十世纪超级大国。 中国目前正处于一个与当时的美国类似却不完全相同的阶段。 2012年习近平主席当选后，中国进入了自己的镀金时代，与前任主席领导下的中国相比，习近平领导下的中国要富裕得多。 但习近平也必须面对中等收入、裙带资本主义经济带来的一系列问题，尤其是腐败。 正如他在2012 年对政治局的首次演讲中警示道，腐败“必然使党和国家走向灭亡 ” 。 在过去的几十年里，中国经济高速发展，而一种特殊的腐败现象也日益严重：精英之间交换钱权，我把这种钱称为“通道钱 ” 。 从21世纪开始，随着政府不断加强监督能力，热情欢迎投资者进行投资，贪污和小规模的敲诈勒索现象减少。 但是，由于一些涉政资本家向政治家行贿，以换取可以赚大钱的特权，高风险的贪污行为出现了。 与裙带关系一同到来的是不平等的加剧。 自20世纪80年代以来，中国的收入不平等现象比美国更严重。 2012年，中国的基尼系数（衡量收入不平等的标准）超过了美国。 由于那些在早期增长阶段积累资产的人获得了巨额收益，中国的贫富差距甚至比收入差距还要大。 第三个问题是系统性金融风险。 2020年，中国财政部警告说，地方政府的债务已经接近所有收入总和的100 % 。 如果地方政府违约，向其提供巨额贷款的银行和金融机构将被曝光，可能会引发连锁反应。 而遇到麻烦的不仅仅是政府财政。 例如，中国第二大房地产开发商恒大如今负债3000亿美元，濒临破产。 不过，我们不应孤立地看待这些正在发生的危机；相反，它们与中国镀金时代相互关联。 以获取金钱为形式的腐败驱使政府官员积极推动建设和投资，而不考虑建设的可持续性。 豪华地产如雨后春笋般出现在全国各地，为串通一气的地方和商业精英带来巨额收入，而经济适用房却仍然供不应求。 那些拥有政治关系和财富的人通过投机性投资轻松获得了超额利润。 同样，在数字经济中，昔日的自由竞争市场，如今已为几个巨头控制，他们可以轻易地压制小公司。 工厂工人正在被临时工取代，他们长时间劳动，获得的劳动保护不足。 现在的年轻人已经厌倦了过度的物质主义和内卷，他们正通过“躺平 ” （ 停止奋斗）来抗议。 中国镀金时代的堕落给习近平带来了多重威胁。 腐败、不平等和金融危机会引发社会动 荡，挑战中国共产党承诺的实现平等和正义。 这些问题 — — 尤其是精英阶层的腐败，让敌对派发财 — — 都会削弱习近平的领导力。 因此，习近平决心带领中国走出镀金时代，既是为了拯救中国共产党，也是为了巩固他作为领导人的地位，实现党的“初心使命 ” 。 邓小平渴望让中国富起来，而习近平希望也能让中国也变得干净和公平。 在过去两个月里，西方投资者突然开始领悟到习近平对“共同繁荣”的倡议。 但习近平的社会主义使命实际上始于2012年，当时他发誓要消除农村贫困，并同时发起了中共历史上最大规模的反腐运动。 尽管新冠疫情爆发，习近平还是坚持继续推行这些运动，他在2020年自豪地宣布，扶贫目标已如期实现。 最近，这些运动已经扩展到对大型科技公司的监管打击，禁止课外辅导，规定房价上限，对富有的名人进行打击。 最重要的是，习近平亲自鼓励富人与社会分享财富。 美国的镀金时代为理解习近平的行动提供了一个历史参考。 所有的裙带资本主义经济，无 论发展多么迅速，最终都会受到限制。 按照美国的历史经验推测,中国今天面临的问题并不一定会招致厄运。 这在很大程度上取决于政策制定者接下来的行动。 如果这些问题得到适当解决，中国也可以从危险且不平衡的增长走向更高质量的发展。 但是，美国的进步时代依靠民主措施来打击裙带资本主义 — — 例如，通过政治活动和揭发“丑闻”的自由媒体来揭露腐败 — — 习近平正试图通过命令和管控迈入中国自己的进步时代。 但目前世界上还没有一个政府通过法令成功克服资本主义的缺陷。 几十年前，毛泽东曾试图命令快速工业化，结果惨遭失败。 得到的教训是，自上而下的命令确实会适得其反，因此不能依赖命令解决所有问题。 如果过度和任意使用禁令和命令，将削弱投资者对中国领导人基于规则的市场承诺的信心。 美国的进步主义为该国在20世纪的国际首要地位奠定了国内基础。 习近平能否带领中国 走出镀金时代，将会决定中国是否能在二十一世纪持续发展。"

            "Global Silence on China’s Gulag NEW DELHI – For more than two years, China has waged a campaign of unparalleled repression against its Islamic minorities, incarcerating an estimated one-sixth of the adult Muslim population of the Xinjiang region at one point or another. Yet, with the exception of a recent tweet from US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo calling on China to “end its repression,” the international community has remained largely mute. In its reliance on mass detention, the Communist Party of China (CPC) has followed the Soviet Union’s example. But China’s concentration camps and detention centers are far larger and more technologically advanced than their Soviet precursors, and their purpose is to indoctrinate not just political dissidents, but an entire community of faith. Although independent researchers and human-rights groups have raised awareness of practices such as force-feeding Muslims alcohol and pork, the Chinese authorities have been able to continue their assault on Islam with impunity. Even as China’s security agencies pursue Uighurs and other Muslims as far afield as Turkey, Chinese leaders and companies involved in the persecution have not faced international sanctions or incurred any other costs. Chief among the culprits, of course, is Chinese President Xi Jinping, who in 2014 ordered the policy change that set the stage for today’s repression of ethnic Uighurs, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, Hui, and members of other Muslim groups. The forcible assimilation of Muslims into the country’s dominant Han culture is apparently a cornerstone of Xiism – or “Xi Jinping Thought” – the grand “ism” that Xi has introduced to overshadow the influence of Marxism and Maoism in China. To oversee this large-scale deprogramming of Islamic identities, Xi, who has amassed more power than any Chinese leader since Mao Zedong, reassigned the notorious CPC enforcer Chen Quanguo from Tibet to Xinjiang and elevated him to the all-powerful Politburo. Though Chen’s record of overseeing human-rights abuses is well known, the Trump administration has yet to act on a bipartisan commission’s 2018 recommendation that he and other Chinese officials managing the gulag policy be sanctioned. In general, financial and trade interests, not to mention the threat of Chinese retribution, have deterred most countries from condemning China’s anti-Muslim policies. With the exception of Turkey, even predominantly Muslim countries that were quick to condemn Myanmar for its treatment of Rohingya Muslims have remained conspicuously silent on China. While Pakistan’s military-backed prime minister, Imran Khan, has feigned ignorance about the Xinjiang crackdown, Saudi Arabia’s powerful crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, has gone so far as to defend China’s right to police “terrorism.” Emboldened by the muted international response, China has stepped up its drive to Sinicize Xinjiang by demolishing Muslim neighborhoods. In Urumqi and other cities, once-bustling Uighur districts have been replaced with heavily policed zones purged of Islamic culture. The irony is that while China justifies its “reeducation hospitals” as necessary to cleanse Muslim minds at home of extremist thoughts, it is effectively supporting Islamist terrorism abroad. For example, China has repeatedly blocked UN sanctions against Masood Azhar, the head of the Pakistan-based, UN-designated terrorist group responsible for carrying out serial attacks in India, including on Parliament and, most recently, on a paramilitary police convoy. As Pompeo tweeted, “The world cannot afford China’s shameful hypocrisy toward Muslims. On one hand, China abuses more than a million Muslims at home, but on the other it protects violent Islamic terrorist groups from sanctions at the UN.” An added irony is that while China still harps on its “century of humiliation” at the hands of foreign imperial powers, it has for decades presided over the mass humiliation of minorities in Xinjiang and Tibet. Ominously, by systematically degrading Muslim populations, it could be inspiring white supremacists and other Islamaphobes around the world. For example, the Australian extremist arrested for the recent twin mosque massacres in Christchurch, New Zealand, declared an affinity for China’s political and social values. There has been a good deal of reporting about how China has turned Xinjiang into a laboratory for Xi’s Orwellian surveillance ambitions. Less known is how Xi’s trillion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative is being used as a catalyst for the crackdown. According to Chinese authorities, the establishment of a surveillance state is necessary to prevent unrest in the province at the heart of the BRI’s overland route. Like Marxism-Leninism, Nazism, Stalinism, and Maoism, which left millions of people dead, Xiism promises to impose significant long-term costs on untold numbers of innocent people. It is the impetus behind China’s ruthless targeting of minority cultures and communities, as well as its aggressive expansion into international waters and introduction of digital totalitarianism. Thanks to Xiism, the world’s largest, strongest, and oldest autocracy finds itself at a crossroads. As the People’s Republic of China approaches its 70th birthday, its economy is slowing amid escalating capital flight, trade disruptions, and the emigration of wealthy Chinese. The Chinese technology champion Huawei’s international travails augur difficult times ahead. The last thing China needs right now is more enemies. Yet Xi has used his unbridled power to expand China’s global footprint and lay bare his imperial ambitions. His repression of Muslim minorities may or may not lead to international action against China. But it will almost certainly spawn a new generation of Islamist terrorists, compounding China’s internal-security challenges. China’s domestic security budget is already larger than its bloated defense budget, which makes it second only to the United States in terms of military spending. The Soviet Union once held the same position – until it collapsed.",
            "对中国古拉格的全球沉默 新德里—两年多来，中国发动了一场前所未有的镇压运动针对其穆斯林少数民族，最多时新疆地区成年穆斯林人口被囚禁比例据估计高达六分之一。 但是，除了美国国务卿蓬佩奥（Mike Pompeo）最近发了一条推特要求中国“结束压迫 ” ， 国际社会对这一现象基本没有发出任何声音。 中共的大规模拘禁是在效仿苏联。 但中国的集中营和拘留中心比苏联大得多，技术上也先进得多，其目的不仅仅是给政治异见分子，而是给整个信仰群体“洗脑 ” 。 尽管独立研究者和人权组织已经了解到存在强迫穆斯林喝酒吃猪肉等行为，但中国当局仍能够继续迫害伊斯兰教而不受惩罚。 尽管中国安全部门远赴土耳其抓捕维吾尔族和其他穆斯林，但参与迫害的中国领导人和公司并没有面临国际制裁或付出其他任何代价。 当然，首席罪犯是中国国家主席习近平，他在2014年下令改变政策，成为今天压迫维吾尔族、哈萨克族、吉尔吉斯族、回族和其他穆斯林群体的基础。 强迫穆斯林被中国主体汉文化所吸收显然是习主义 — — “习近平思想 ” — —的基石之一。 习近平思想是习近平所提出的、在中国的影响力比马克思主义和毛泽东思想更大的“主义 ” 。 习近平是毛泽东以来权力最大的中国领导人，为了监督这一对穆斯林身份的大规模清洗，他将著名的中共执行者陈全国从西藏调到新疆，并提拔他进入权力最大的政治局。 尽管陈全国主管人权侵犯行为的记录早已众所周知，但特朗普政府并没有根据两党委员会的2018年建议 — — 陈全国和其他古拉格政策主管中国官员应该受到制裁 — — 采取行动。 总体而言，金融和贸易利益，更不用说中国报复的威胁，让大部分国家不敢谴责中国的反穆斯林政策。 除了土耳其，即使是穆斯林占多数的国家，也对中国的行为保持引人注目的沉默，而当初缅甸对待罗兴亚穆斯林的行为立即遭到了他们的谴责。 巴基斯坦军方支持的总理汗假装不知道新疆镇压行为，而沙特阿拉伯的权势人物、王储穆罕默德·本·萨勒曼甚至为中国的执法“恐怖主义”辩护。 国际反应阙如让中国放胆执行新疆中国化政策，压迫穆斯林社区。 在乌鲁木齐和其他城市，曾经熙熙攘攘的维吾尔族区被驱逐了伊斯兰文化、由重重警力维护的区域所取代。 讽刺的是，中国辩称其“再教育医院”是清除穆斯林极端思想的必要措施，但这事实上支持了国外的伊斯兰恐怖主义。 比如，据报道中国阻挠针对联合国认定的巴基斯坦恐怖组织头目马苏德·阿扎尔（Masood Azhar）的联合国制裁，他的组织在印度发动了一系列袭击，包括对印度议会的袭击以及最近对武装警察的袭击。 蓬佩奥在推特上说“中国对穆斯林的伪善态度令世界不堪重负。 一方面，中国在国内压迫一百多万穆斯林，另一方面，它又保护伊斯兰恐怖组织不受联合国制裁 。 ” 更大的讽刺之处是，中国仍在反复强调帝国主义列强给它带来的“世纪耻辱 ” ， 而几十年来它在新疆和西藏进行大规模羞辱少数民族。 不祥的是，系统性地压迫穆斯林群体可能山东全世界的白人至上主义和其他“穆黑 ” 。 比如，最近在新西兰克里斯特彻奇（Christchurch）制造两起清真寺大屠杀而被逮捕的澳大利亚极端分子说他非常仰慕中国的政治和社会价值观。 大量报道指出，中国将新疆变成了习近平的奥威尔式监控野心的试验场。 比较鲜为人知的是，习近平的万亿美元规模的一带一路家也被用来作为镇压的催化剂。 据中国当局，建设监控之国是必要的，是为了预防一带一路计划的陆上通道心脏地带省份发生动乱。 和让数百万人丧生的马列主义、纳粹主义、斯大林主义和毛主义一样，习主义要给无数无辜人民带去巨大的长期代价。 这就是中国残酷地针对少数民族文化和社区，以及在国际水域请略扩张和引入数字极权主义背后的动力。 拜习主义所赐，全世界最大、最强、最古老的专制体制站在了十字路口。 在中华人民共和国迎来七十华诞之际，其经济因为资本外逃、贸易纠纷和富豪移民情况的加剧而放缓。 中国技术巨头华为所遇到的国际阵痛预示着前路艰难。 中国现在最需要避免的是树立更多敌人。 但习近平用其不受约束的权力扩大中国的全球足迹，其帝国野心暴露无遗。 他对穆斯林少数民族的压迫未必导致国际对华制裁。 但几乎肯定会孕育新一代伊斯兰恐怖分子，加剧中国内部安全隐患。 中国的内部安全预算已经超过了其膨胀的国防预算（中国军费支出仅次于美国，位列世界第二 ） 。 苏联曾经也是如此 — — 然后它解体了。"

            "Xi’s Strong Hand Against Trump LONDON – The world will soon witness a historic test of wills between China and the United States, two superpowers whose leaders see themselves as supreme. In the immediate sense, it will be a battle over trade. But also at stake is the strategic leadership of East Asia and, eventually, the international order. As things stand, China holds a stronger position than many people realize. The question is whether Chinese President Xi Jinping will feel confident or brazen enough to want to prove it. The test of wills was hardly China’s choice; but nor does it come as a surprise. US President Donald Trump’s recently announced import tariffs on steel, aluminum, and other Chinese-made goods are in keeping with his brand of economic nationalism. And his decision to accept North Korea’s invitation to hold bilateral talks on its nuclear program reflects the same “bring it on” attitude that he applied to the North’s earlier threats of war. The upcoming test will be historic because it promises to reveal the true strengths and attitudes of the world’s rising power vis-à-vis the weakened but still leading incumbent power. For better or worse, the result could shape the world for decades to come. On the trade front, China’s large bilateral surplus with the US could mean that it has more to lose from a trade war, simply because it has more exports that can be penalized. It is often said that surplus countries will always be the biggest losers in any tit-for-tat escalation of tariffs and other barriers. But this assumption misses multiple points. For one thing, China is more economically resilient to the effects of a trade war than it used to be. Trade as a share of its total economic activity has halved in the past decade, from more than 60% of GDP in 2007 to just over 30% today. China also has major advantages in terms of domestic politics and international diplomacy. As a dictatorship, China can ignore protests by workers and companies suffering from US tariffs. In the US, where mid-term congressional elections will be held this November, the outcry from exporters, importers, and consumers facing higher costs will be heard loud and clear. Of course, Trump, too, might ignore protests against his trade war if he is convinced that taking on China will please his core voters and win him re-election in 2020. But congressional Republicans will probably feel differently, especially if their states or districts are among those being singled out by Chinese import tariffs. In terms of international diplomacy, Trump’s trade war will help China present itself as the defender of the rules-based international order and multilateral institutions such as the World Trade Organization. To be sure, not all countries would follow China’s lead. The WTO does not recognize China as a market economy, owing to the Chinese government’s significant involvement in industry and alleged theft of intellectual property. But China will have a chance to play the victim, while arguing that the US now poses the single largest threat to the global trading system that it helped create. And if a US-initiated trade war drags on, China’s case will become only stronger as more countries suffer the disruptive effects of tariffs. Of course, China may choose not to fight Trump’s trade war at all. With symbolic concessions – such as an agreement to import US-produced liquefied natural gas or promises to offer new guarantees for intellectual-property rights – it could convince Trump to stand down. But if Xi suspects that a show of strength will bolster China’s international standing while undercutting that of the US, he may decide to act accordingly. The North Korea issue is more complicated. But here, too, China will have an advantage. Even barring real progress in the talks, China already looks like a good global citizen. Over the past year, it has been pressuring the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, to negotiate. By participating in coordinated economic sanctions against the Kim regime, and by reportedly capping vital exports of oil and other essentials to the North, China has played its part in bringing Kim to the table. On paper, the fundamental question is whether North Korea will be willing to abandon its nuclear-weapons program, the fruit of more than 30 years of work. And as China well knows, North Korea would never give up its nuclear weapons without major changes in the military balance on and around the Korean Peninsula. Kim will likely offer to denuclearize solely on the condition that the US withdraw its forces from South Korea, and perhaps from Japan, too. Barring that, he would not feel secure enough to do without the nuclear deterrence on which he has staked his regime’s survival. For his part, Trump could not possibly accede to such a condition. At best, he could agree on a process through which such extraordinary moves might be discussed at a later date. Either way, China comes out on top. In the event of stalemate, it will have gotten Kim to the table and put America in the position of being a refusenik. And if the US does agree to any military concessions, China’s strategic position will be strengthened. The only real question for Xi, then, is whether he wants to assert China’s top-dog status now, or sometime in the future.",
            "习近平对特朗普的强手 伦敦—世界将目睹中国和美国之间的历史性考验，这两个超级大国的领导人都自视为超级领袖。 眼下，这场考验将是贸易战。 但同样有可能成为斗争对象的还有东亚以及最终的国际秩序的战略领导地位。 目前，中国手牌之强超乎许多人的意料。 问题在于中国国家主席习近平会充满自信还是会“任性”地想要证明这一点。 意志的考验向来不是中国的选择；但这也不是什么令人意外的事。 美国总统特朗普最近宣布对钢、铝和其他中国制造产品征收关税，这与他经济民族主义的名声倒是相符。 他还决定接受朝鲜的邀请，就朝鲜核计划进行双边对话，这反映了与他此前应对朝鲜战争威胁时相同的“放马过来”态度。 即将到来的考验之所以是历史性的，是因为它有可能揭示世界崛起强国对已削弱但仍起着领导作用的现任强国的真正优势和态度。 在贸易方面，中国对美国保持巨大的双边盈余，这意味着它在贸易战中可以输的东西更多，因为它有更多的出口可以被惩罚。 人们常说，盈余国永远是以牙还牙的关税和其他壁垒大爆发的最大输家。 但这一说法没有抓住很多要点。 一方面，相较从前，如今中国对贸易战行为的经济承受力更强了。 贸易占总经济活动之比在过去十年中下降了一半，从2007年占GDP的60%以上下降到今天的略高于30 % 。 中国在国内政治和国际外交方面也拥有重大优势。 作为独裁国家，中国可以无视因为美国的关税而受到影响的工人和公司的示威。 在美国，中期国会选举11月就要拉开帷幕，面临更高成本的出口商、进口商和消费者的呼声表达的非常清楚。 当然，如果特朗普确信与中国较量能取悦他的核心选民，为他赢得2020年连任，那么他也有可能忽视反对他的贸易战政策的示威。 但国会共和党感觉将有所不同，特别是如果他们的州或选区成为中国进口关税征收对象的话。 用国际外交的话说，特朗普的贸易战有助于中国将自己包装为基于规则的国际秩序以及世贸组织等多边机构的捍卫者。 当然，并不是所有国家都会跟随中国的领导。 世贸组织不承认中国是市场经济，因为中国政府严重干涉产业，并被控窃取知识产权。 但中国将有机会扮演受害者角色，指责美国成为它所帮助建立的全球贸易体系的最大威胁。 而如果美国发动的贸易战延绵日久，中国的指控将随着越来越多的国家因为关税的破坏效应而变得更强。 当然，中国可能选择根本不与特朗普打贸易战。 象征性的让步 — — 如同意进口美国产液化天然气或承诺新的知识产权权利保障 — — 就可能让特朗普满意收手。 但如果习近平认为示强能增强中国的国际地位，同时削弱美国的国际地位，他有可能做出这样的决定。 朝鲜问题更加复杂。 但在这个问题上，中国也有优势。 即使阻挠了谈判的真正进展，中国看上去也像是国际好公民。 去年它一直在施压朝鲜领导人金正恩参与谈判。 加入针对金氏政权的合作共同经济制裁，以及（据称）切断对朝鲜至关重要的石油和其他必需品出口意味着中国在吸引金正恩回到谈判桌方面起着作用。 表面上看，根本性问题是朝鲜是否愿意放弃其30多年来的工作成果 — — 核武器计划。 中国十分清楚，朝鲜绝对不会在朝鲜半岛周边军事平衡发生重大改变的情况下放弃核武器。 金正恩可能提出，只要美国从韩国（也许还有日本）撤军就实施去核化。 否则的话，他就无法在失去与其政权的生存系于一身的核威慑的情况下获得安全感。 无论如何，中国占尽主动。 如果出现僵局，它会让金正恩回到谈判桌，而让美国陷入被拒移民（refusenik）的地位。 如果美国真的同意军事让步，中国的战略地位也会增强。 因此，对习近平来说，唯一的真正的问题是他想现在就树立中国“带头大哥”的地位，还是等到未来某个时刻再树立。"

            "Xi Jinping’s Annus Horribilis CLAREMONT, CALIFORNIA – China’s strongman leader can’t seem to catch a break. From the trade war with the United States to the crisis in Hong Kong to international criticism of his human-rights record, President Xi Jinping suffered major setbacks in 2019, and his prospects for 2020 appear even worse. China could have ended the trade war with the US last May, thereby giving its flagging economy a significant boost. Yet, at the last minute, Chinese leaders backtracked on a number of issues that American negotiators had considered settled. With the US also incurring high costs from the trade war, President Donald Trump was furious, and took his revenge. Beyond imposing new tariffs, Trump escalated his efforts to limit China’s access to vital technologies. Less than two weeks after the trade agreement collapsed, Trump signed an executive order barring US companies from using telecoms equipment from manufacturers that his administration deemed a national security risk. The most prominent of these is the Chinese tech giant Huawei, which Trump had already been targeting for months. While the US and China have announced agreement on the terms of a new “phase one” trade deal, the technology war – and the broader confrontation between the two powers – will continue. This implies that Xi’s problems won’t go away, given China’s enduring economic dependence on the outside world and the importance of rising living standards to sustaining the legitimacy of one-party rule. Further risks arise from Hong Kong, which is engulfed in its worst political crisis since its return to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. It all started when Hong Kong’s China-backed chief executive proposed a bill that would make it easier to extradite criminal suspects from the city to the mainland. Viewing this as part of a broader central-government campaign to assert tighter control over the special administrative region, people poured into the streets to protest. The government refused to budge, so the protesters became angrier, and their numbers grew. Asia’s commercial hub quickly became a battle zone, with riot police firing tear gas and rubber bullets at black-clad protesters, who responded with Molotov cocktails and bricks. By the time the bill was formally withdrawn, months had passed, and it was too late to return the genie to the bottle. Despite thousands of arrests, the protesters have shown no signs of backing down. In late November, after more than six months of unrest, China’s government suffered the ultimate indignity, when nearly three million voters turned out to hand an overwhelming victory to pro-democracy forces in local district-council elections (which won 388 of the 452 contested seats). At this point, a crackdown reminiscent of the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre would be likely to backfire, leaving Xi with few options. Xi suffered another serious blow in November, when The New York Times obtained more than 400 pages of internal Chinese documents concerning the mass incarceration of ethnic minorities – particularly Muslim Uighurs – in the Xinjiang region. Only Chinese government insiders had access to such sensitive materials, suggesting that Xi’s political enemies may have deliberately leaked them to the Western press in order to undermine his international standing. Xi is also losing his grip in Taiwan. At the end of last year, Taiwan’s ruling pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party, led by President Tsai Ing-wen, was dealt a painful general election defeat. But, since the protests erupted in Hong Kong, Tsai has portrayed herself as defending Taiwan from a Chinese-government stooge who would accept a “one country, two systems” model. Tsai now seems set to secure a landslide victory in next month’s presidential election. Xi can blame only himself – or, more specifically, his excessive centralization of power – for the challenges of the last year. Trade disputes with the US, concerns about Chinese interference in Hong Kong, and ethnic tensions in Xinjiang all preceded Xi’s rise to power in late 2012. But China’s collective leadership, however corrupt and indecisive, managed to limit the escalation of these crises, thanks largely to their aversion to risk. For example, when more than a half-million people in Hong Kong protested against a proposed national security law in 2003, the Chinese government immediately agreed to its withdrawal. As Xi has concentrated political power in his own hands, however, decision-making has been transformed. Those hoping to influence policy must gain access to Xi himself, and they have every incentive to cherry-pick information to support his preferences. Likewise, Xi’s colleagues on the Politburo Standing Committee, fearful of appearing disloyal, are loath to share information that may contradict his view. They know that proposing an alternate approach could be seen as a direct challenge to Xi’s authority. Xi’s intolerance of dissent and vulnerability to bad information has made his government much more prone to policy blunders. Making matters worse, because a strongman must maintain an image of virtual infallibility, even demonstrably ineffective or counterproductive policies are unlikely to be reversed. For now, Xi’s grip on power is probably secure. But, with decision-making dynamics at the top unlikely to change, he will become vulnerable to more challenges in the coming months. Indeed, 2020 may turn out to be Xi’s worst year yet.",
            "流年不利的习近平 发自加利福尼亚州克莱尔蒙特—中国的强人领袖似乎一刻也不得消停。 从对美贸易战到香港危机，再到国际对其人权记录的批评，习近平主席在2019年屡遭重大挫败，而他来年的境况似乎还要更糟糕。 中国本可以在去年五月结束与美国的贸易战，从而大幅提振其陷入不景的经济。 然而在最后一刻中国领导人却在美国谈判代表认为已经达成协议的许多问题上反悔了。 由于美国也因贸易战而承担了沉重的代价，特朗普总统很恼怒，并开始出手报复。 除了征收新的关税外，特朗普还加大力度限制中国获得重要技术的渠道。 特朗普在贸易协议破裂后不到两周内签署了一项行政命令，禁止美国企业使用某些其政府认定存在国家安全风险的中国制造商的电信设备。 首当其冲的是特朗普已经盯住了几个月的中国科技巨头华为。 尽管中美已经宣布就一项新的“第一阶段”贸易协定达成协议，但科技战 — — 以及两大国之间的更广泛对抗 — — 将持续下去。 这意味着在中国在经济上对外界的长期依赖以及人民生活水平的提升对维持一党制合法性的重要性之下，习近平所面对的麻烦将依然存在。 而进一步的风险则来自于香港 — — 该地陷入了自1997年回归中国以来最严重的一场政治危机。 事情的起因是中国大陆支持的特首提出了一项旨在更便利地将犯罪嫌疑人引渡到大陆的法案，而民众则将其视之为中央政府加紧控制该特别行政区的更宏大计划的的组成部分并涌上街头抗议。 政府拒绝让步，进一步激怒了抗议者，示威人数也不断增加。 香港这个亚洲商业中心迅速成为战场，防暴警察向穿着黑衣的示威者发射催泪瓦斯和橡皮子弹，抗议者用自制燃烧瓶和砖头来回击。 等到法案被正式撤回时事件已经延续了几个月，如今想让一切恢复原状为时已晚。 尽管有数千人被捕，但示威者并未显示出退缩的迹象。 11月下旬 — — 也就是动乱持续六个多月后 — — 中国政府遭受到了最极致的羞辱，近300万香港选民在区议会选举中为泛民主派带来了一场压倒性胜利（赢得了452席中赢得388席 ） 。 鉴于在此情况下发动一场类似1989年天安门广场大屠杀的镇压行动可能会适得其反，因此习近平也拿不出什么好的对策出来。 在同一时间习近平遭受了又一次严重打击，当时《纽约时报》获得了多达400页的中国政府内部文件，内容涉及对新疆地区少数民族尤其是维吾尔族穆斯林的大规模监禁。 只有中国政府内部人士才能获得此类敏感材料，这表明可能有习近平的政敌故意将其泄露给西方媒体以削弱其国际地位。 习近平对台湾也失去了控制。 虽然去年年底执政的亲台独势力民进党（由主席蔡英文领导）在地方选举时惨败，但自从抗议活动在香港爆发以来，蔡英文就把自己描绘成避免台湾沦为中国政府“一国两制”模式傀儡的捍卫者。 如今蔡英文似乎有望在下个月的总统大选中获得压倒性胜利。 对此习近平只能为2019年发生的事责怪自己 — — 或更具体地说，是自己的过分集权。 与美国之间的贸易争端，对中国干预香港的忧虑以及新疆的民族紧张局势都在习近平于2012年底上台执政之前就已存在。 但此前中国的集体领导层 — — 无论是多么腐败还是优柔寡断 — — 都设法限制了这些危机的升级，这在很大程度上要归功于他们不愿担风险的本性。 比如当2003年香港有超过50万人抗议提交审议的国家安全法时，中国政府当即同意将其撤回。 但随着习近平将政治权力握于手中，决策方式也发生了发生转变。 那些希望影响政策的人必须亲近习近平本人，也存在各种动机去促使他们选择性呈报信息以迎合其喜好。 其他政治局常委为表达忠诚也不愿分享与其观点相左的信息，因为他们知道提出任何替代方案都可能被视为对习近平权威的直接挑战。 习近平对异议以及坏消息的不容忍使他的政府更容易出现政策失误。 更糟的是，由于政治强人必须维持一种永不出错的形象，因此即便是那些明显无效或适得其反的政策都不太可能得到纠正。 就目前而言，习近平对权力的控制或许是稳固的。 但由于高层决策的态势不太可能改变，他可能在未来几个月间面临更多的挑战。 实际上，2020年可能是习近平最糟糕的一年。"

            "Blowing Down the CPC’s House of Cards CLAREMONT, CALIFORNIA – At the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China this month, Xi Jinping will almost certainly be confirmed for a third term as the Party’s general secretary and China’s president. With that, he will become China’s longest-serving paramount leader since Mao Zedong, and the rules and norms that are supposed to govern the CPC regime will be shattered. Those rules and norms were put in place largely by Mao’s successor, Deng Xiaoping, who took power in 1978. Deng knew firsthand the damage the Party’s ideological fanaticism could do. During the Cultural Revolution, one of his sons was paralyzed by rampaging Red Guards. Deng himself was stripped of his official positions and sent to work at a factory in a remote province for four years – one of three times he was purged from government during his long revolutionary career. To ensure that China would never again be gripped by such terror, Deng – with the support of other veteran revolutionaries who had survived the Cultural Revolution – restored collective leadership and imposed age and term limits for most senior CPC positions. In the decades that followed, China’s top leaders served no more than two terms, and Politburo members respected an implicit age limit of 68. But Xi has exposed just how fragile Deng’s “rules-based system” really was. In fact, for all the hoopla about Deng’s accomplishments, his record on reining in the CPC regime is mixed, at best, not least because his own commitment to the rules was not nearly as robust as one might expect. In practice, Deng disdained collective leadership and formal procedures. He seldom held Politburo Standing Committee meetings, because he wanted to deny his main rival, a staunch conservative opposed to economic reform, a platform to challenge his policy. Instead, he exercised leadership through private meetings with supporters. Moreover, in dealing with leaders sympathetic to pro-democracy forces, Deng frequently violated the procedures and norms he had established. His dismissal of two liberal CPC chiefs – Hu Yaobang in 1986 and Zhao Ziyang (who refused Deng’s order to implement martial law during the Tiananmen crisis) in 1989 – defied the Party’s bylaws. At the same time, Deng sometimes avoided introducing a rule at all, if doing so could undermine his political interests. Most notably, he – together with other aging CPC leaders – did not impose age or term limits on Politburo members. Even if they could not hold formal government posts indefinitely, they would never lose their decision-making authority. Likewise, Deng enacted no formal rules governing who could chair the Central Military Commission. This enabled him to continue to do so after he had resigned from his other posts. Following that precedent, Jiang Zemin did the same in 2002. As for Xi, while he had to go through the motions of getting the presidential term limit removed from the constitution in 2018, he benefited from the fact that the CPC has not imposed an official term limit on its general secretary. There is nothing shocking about China’s struggles to uphold rules and norms. Even mature democracies like the United States face such challenges, as Donald Trump’s presidency clearly showed. But should formal constitutional checks and balances fail, democracies can at least count on a free press, civil society, and opposition parties to push back, as they did against Trump. In dictatorships, rules and norms are far more fragile, as there are no credible constitutional or political enforcement mechanisms, and autocrats can easily politicize institutions, such as constitutional courts, turning such bodies into rubber stamps. And there are no secondary enforcement mechanisms. China has no free press or organized opposition. If a rule becomes inconvenient – as the constitutional limit on presidential terms did for Xi – it can easily be changed. While trampling institutional rules and norms may benefit autocratic rulers, it is not necessarily good for their regimes. The CPC’s experience under Mao is a case in point. Unencumbered by any institutional constraints, Mao engaged in ceaseless purges and led the Party from one disaster to another, leaving behind a regime that was ideologically exhausted and economically bankrupt. Deng understood that a rules-based system was essential to avoid repeating that disastrous experience. But his conviction could not overcome his self-interest, and the institutional edifice he built in the 1980s turned out to be little more than a house of cards. Xi’s confirmation this month is merely the breeze triggering its inevitable collapse.",
            "摧毁中共的纸牌屋 发自加州克莱蒙特 — — 习近平几乎肯定会在本月召开的中共第二十次全国代表大会上连续第三次当选党总书记和中国国家主席，也将因此成为自毛泽东以来中国任职时间最长的最高领导人，而本应控制着中共政权的那些规则和规范则将被打破。 这些规则和规范主要是由毛泽东的继任者、1978年上台的邓小平制定的。 邓小平亲身体会过党的意识形态狂热可能造成的破坏。 在文化大革命期间他有一个儿子被狂躁的红卫兵打成瘫痪，本人也被撤职下放到一个偏远省份工厂里劳动了四年 — — 在他漫长革命生涯中曾三度被打倒，这是其中之一。 为确保国家不再被这种恐怖所笼罩，邓小平 — — 在其他经历过文革的老革命支持下 — — 恢复了集体领导，并对大多数中共高级职位下达了年龄和任期限制。 在随后几十年间中国最高领导人的任期全都不超过两届，政治局委员也都遵守着68岁的不成文退休上限。 但习近平暴露了邓小平这套“基于规则的制度”的脆弱性。 事实上虽然邓小平的成就被广为宣扬，但他在控制中共政权方面的记录充其量也只能是好坏参半，这主要是因为他自己对规则的承诺并不像人们所期望的那样有力。 在实际操作中邓小平并不在意集体领导和正式程序。 他很少召开政治局常委会议，因为不想让自己的主要政敌 — — 一个反对经济改革的坚定保守派人物 — — 拥有一个挑战自身政策的平台。 相反他会通过与支持者私下开会来实施领导。 此外邓小平也多次在处理那些同情民主势力的领导人时违反自己制定的程序和规范。 他撤掉两位中共自由派领导人 — — 胡耀邦（1986年辞职）和赵紫阳（1989年因拒绝执行邓小平在天安门危机期间实施戒严的命令被撤职 ） — —的做法都违反了党的章程。 与此同时，邓小平有时会完全避免引入某项有损害其政治利益的规则。 最值得注意的就是他和其他年迈中共领导人一道并未对政治局委员施加任何年龄或任期限制，使他们在无法无限期担任政府正式职务的情况下也不会失去手里的决策权。 同样，邓小平也没有制定正式规则来规定谁可以担任中央军事委员会主席，这使他在辞去其他职务后仍能继续保留这一职位。 参照这一先例，江泽民在2002年也采取了同样的做法。 至于习近平，虽然他不得不在2018年走个形式去将主席任期限制从宪法中删除，但在总书记方面却省心了很多，因为中共并未对该职位出台正式的任期限制。 中国在维护规则和规范方面的艰难抗争并不让人感到意外，因为即使美国这样的成熟民主国家也面临着类似的挑战 — — 特朗普的总统任期就清楚表明了这一点。 但如果正式的宪法制衡失效，民主国家至少可以依靠自由的新闻界、公民社会和反对党来进行回击，正如它们对特朗普所做的那样。 而那些独裁国家的规则和规范则脆弱得多，因为缺乏有公信力宪法或政治执行机制，使得独裁者可以轻易将宪法法院等机构政治化，将其变成橡皮图章。 同时也不存在任何二级执行机制。 中国没有自由的媒体或有组织的反对派。 如果一项规则变得碍手碍脚（就像宪法中的主席任期限制对习近平的影响那样 ） ， 那修订它并非难事。 虽然践踏制度性规则和规范可能对专制统治者有利，但对他们手中的政权却不一定有利。 中共在毛泽东时期的经历就是一个例子：他在没有任何制度约束的情况下进行了无休止的清洗，将党引向了一个又一个灾难，最终留下一个意识形态上枯竭、经济上破产的政权。 邓小平认识到必须建立一个基于规则的制度才能免于重蹈这种灾难性经历。 但他的这一信念却最终在自身利益面前败下阵来，他在1980年代建立的体制大厦最终只是一座纸牌屋，而习近平本月的确认当选只是触发其必然崩溃的一阵微风而已。"

            "How Xi Jinping’s “Controlocracy” Lost Control BERKELEY – In his 2016 book The Perfect Dictatorship: China in the 21st Century, Norwegian political scientist Stein Ringen describes contemporary China as a “controlocracy,” arguing that its system of government has been transformed into a new regime radically harder and more ideological than what came before. China’s “controlocracy” now bears primary responsibility for the coronavirus epidemic that is sweeping across that country and the world. Over the past eight years, the central leadership of the Communist Party of China has taken steps to bolster President Xi Jinping’s personal authority, as well as expanding the CPC’s own powers, at the expense of ministries and local and provincial governments. The central authorities have also waged a sustained crackdown on dissent, which has been felt across all domains of Chinese social and political life. Under the controlocracy, websites have been shut down; lawyers, activists, and writers have been arrested; and a general chill has descended upon online expression and media reporting. Equally important, the system Xi has installed since 2012 is also driving the direction of new technologies in China. Cloud computing, big data, and artificial intelligence (AI) are all being deployed to strengthen the central government’s control over society. The first coronavirus case appeared in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province, on December 1, 2019, and, as early as the middle of the month, the Chinese authorities had evidence that the virus could be transmitted between humans. Nonetheless, the government did not officially acknowledge the epidemic on national television until January 20. During those seven weeks, Wuhan police punished eight health workers for attempting to sound the alarm on social media. They were accused of “spreading rumors” and disrupting “social order.” Meanwhile, the Hubei regional government continued to conceal the real number of coronavirus cases until after local officials had met with the central government in mid-January. In the event, overbearing censorship and bureaucratic obfuscation had squandered any opportunity to get the virus under control before it had spread across Wuhan, a city of 11 million people. By January 23, when the government finally announced a quarantine on Wuhan residents, around five million people had already left the city, triggering the epidemic that is now spreading across China and the rest of the world. When the true scale of the epidemic finally became clear, Chinese public opinion reflected a predictable mix of anger, anxiety, and despair. People took to the Internet to vent their rage and frustration. But it did not take long for the state to crack down, severely limiting the ability of journalists and concerned citizens to share information about the crisis. Then, on February 3, after Xi had chaired the Standing Committee’s second meeting on the epidemic, the CPC’s propaganda apparatus was ordered to “guide public opinion and strengthen information control.” In practice, this means that cutting-edge AI and big-data technologies are being used to monitor the entirety of Chinese public opinion online. The controlocracy is now running at full throttle, with facial-, image-, and voice-recognition algorithms being used to anticipate and suppress any potential criticism of the government, and to squelch all “unofficial” information about the epidemic. On February 7, Li Wenliang, one of the physician-whistleblowers who tried to sound the alarm about the outbreak, died of coronavirus, which unleashed a firestorm on social media. The Chinese public is already commemorating him as a hero and victim who tried to tell the truth. Millions have taken to social media to express their grief, and to demand an apology from the Chinese government and freedom of expression. For the first time since coming to power, Xi’s high-tech censorship machine is meeting with intense resistance from millions of Chinese Internet users. The controlocracy is being put to the test. Most likely, though, the outbreak itself will be used to justify even more surveillance and control of the population. Xi is an unabashed dictator. But his dictatorship is far from “perfect.” His obsessive need to control information has deprived Chinese citizens of their right to know what is happening in their communities, and potentially within their own bodies. As of February 9, the outbreak has killed more than 900 people and infected another 40,000 in over 25 countries. For all its advanced digital technologies and extraordinary economic and military power, China is being governed as if it were a pre-modern autocracy. The Chinese people deserve better. Unfortunately, they and the rest of the world will continue to pay a high price for Xi’s hi-tech despotism.",
            "论中国政府的“疫情把控”治理 伯克利—挪威政治学家斯坦·林根（Stein Ringen）将当代中国描述为一个“控制心态较强”的国家，他认为中国的政府体系已经转变，比之前更为强硬、更注重意识形态。 对于当前席卷中国与全球的冠状病毒疫情，这种新体系可能负主要责任。 在过去的八年中，以习近平总书记为核心的党中央不断深化改革，并实施简政放权，使得中国各个领域有条不紊的全速发展。 但言论自由程度仍有待提高。 在一些监督措施下，一些“不良”网站被关闭；一些“不实”言论也被删除；网络言论与媒体报道也普遍没有获得较高的关注度。 同样重要的是，自2012年以来，中国的全面发展也对新技术的发展方向起到了一定的影响。 而云计算、大数据以及人工智能(AI ) ， 也成为政府进行宣传工作的重要辅助力量。 2019年12月1日，第一例冠状病毒感染病例在湖北省会武汉市出现，而早在去年12月中旬，病毒能在人与人之间传播的消息已经存在。 至1月20日，相关部门在国家电视台正式承认这一疫情。 在这七周里，一些奋战在一线的人士与“吹哨人”也再度此进行持续关注。 与此同时，就冠状病毒病例的真实数量，湖北地方政府给出的数据也令人忧心。 直到1月中旬，当地方官员与中央政府会面后，才逐渐使感染人数有了更加官方的定义。 结果是：任然慢半拍的反馈机制与肆虐的疫情相交错，使得这座拥有1400万人口的城市失去了控制疫情的最佳时机。 至1月23日，当政府最终宣布对武汉居民进行隔离时，大约500万人已经离开了这座城市，使得疫情进一步加剧。 当疫情最终达到真实规模时，中国的公众舆论反映出一种可以预见的情绪：混杂着失望、焦虑与不安。 人们在网上倾诉着他们的失望与悲伤。 但没过多久，相关部门便接手工作，信息公布也开始按官方渠道为准，部分媒体的报道受到些许限制。 然后,2月3日,官方开始引导公众舆论，并加强信息疏导，并打击“谣言 ” 。 实际上，这意味着尖端的人工智能与大数据技术正在与中国的舆论场变得紧密结合。 通过智能手段，政府很好的控制了局面，对于一些非官方的言论进行筛查，将“不实信息”降至最低。 在2月7日，作为医生，也是此次疫情“吹哨人”之一的李文亮，也因病去世，在国内引起了不小的关注。 许多民众都为其勇于奋斗的精神而深表敬意。 此外，在社交媒体上，许多网民也自发地对李文亮表示悼念，中国的媒体也对此进行了报道，并对李文亮的奉献精神给与了肯定。 全新的科技发展为人们的生活带来了进步，但也产生了一定的负面作用。 然而，最可能的情况是，此次疫情本身将使得公众对知情权和疾病的防患意识有所加强，并促使政府对人口流动做出监测。 目前，中国政府正在进一步控制疫情的扩散，并对民众进行有效地疏导。 然而，当前的举措似乎仍有很大的提升空间。 此外，政府也致力于保证人民的根本权益，并希望能够尽可能地提升信息的透明度。 截至2月9日，疫情已造成逾900人死亡，超过25个国家的4万人感染。 目前，尽管在数字技术及经济和军事实力表现非凡，但中国对于疫情的走势判断仍处于不明朗的阶段。 因此，中国人民正期待着疫情拐点的到来。 但是，当前仍有许多患者与医护人员深陷其中，中国政府还需继续加大救援力度。"

            "How Xi Jinping Can Strengthen the Chinese Economy CHICAGO – Xi Jinping is poised to become the first three-term president in Chinese history when the Communist Party of China’s 20th National Congress convenes this month. That makes this an opportune time to take stock of Xi’s economic-policy record from the past ten years and explore some obvious steps to improve economic performance in the next term. When Xi assumed China’s top political position in 2012, the economy was thriving, but it also had many serious problems. GDP had been growing at an average annual rate of 10% for over a decade. But a slowdown was inevitable, and GDP growth rates have indeed declined almost every year since 2008. Moreover, inequality was rising, with the Gini index having increased by 13% between 1990 and 2000. By the start of this century, inequality in China had surpassed that of the United States for the first time in the post-1978 reform era. Meanwhile, pollution was literally killing China. By 2013, Beijing’s air had an average of 102 micrograms of PM2.5 particles per cubic meter, whereas Los Angeles – a city historically known for its air pollution – had a PM2.5 reading of only around 15. Chinese city dwellers increasingly complained about the cardiopulmonary illnesses and early mortality associated with pollution. And China was also plagued by water pollution, owing to the chemical runoff from its factories, farms, and mines. In rural areas, entire villages and towns sometimes had to move because their water supply had been irreparably contaminated. China was also gradually losing its workforce. Historically high fertility rates of around six children per woman started to decline in the 1970s and reached their current levels of under two children per women in 2000. China’s working-age cohort shrank from 80% of the total population in 1970 to only 37% in 2012. The share of individuals over age 65 doubled, from 4% in 1970 to 8% in 2012. These trends left the government stuck between a rock and a hard place. Though policymakers needed to keep the overall population from ballooning further, they also needed to maintain the supply of young working people to support the growing elderly population. Social discontent was rising and, according to one popular index, public perceptions of government corruption had doubled between 1991 and 2012. Around 1,300 labor strikes were documented in 2014; by 2016, that figure had more than doubled, to 2,700. When Xi came to power, he took great pains to confront these challenges head-on. But the results have been mixed. On a positive note, PM2.5 readings in major cities like Beijing and Shanghai have been halved over the past ten years, and China’s Gini coefficient today is back below that of the US and 13% below its 2010 peak. But other indicators are less favorable. Between 2012 and the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, China’s annual GDP growth rate has either remained flat or declined. Even though the government has abolished its stringent one-child policy, fertility rates have remained very low. The share of individuals aged 65 and older today is nearly 13%, a new peak for the modern era. Still, it would be misleading to lay all of the past decade’s accomplishments and failures at Xi’s feet. Xi inherited the biggest problems he has faced, which were the unavoidable consequences of China’s previous rapid growth and political and economic history. At the same time, Xi also inherited the main policy solutions to these problems. After all, China started requiring state-owned energy grids to invest in renewable industries all the way back in 1994, and earlier governments also emphasized policies to improve conditions for the poor. Basic medical insurance was introduced to urban areas in 1998 and to rural areas in 2003. Aggregate inequality began to decline two years prior to Xi taking office, and earlier governments regularly pursued their own anti-corruption drives. As Xi continued many of his predecessors’ policy initiatives, the things that were improving continued to improve, and the problems that were hard to fix remained unfixed. What changed most under Xi was not the ostensible policy aims but the mode of implementation. With a few exceptions, such as the one-child policy, post-1978 Chinese policymakers before Xi tended to be cautious and discreet. Important changes, like the introduction of rural elections, were usually piloted quietly and only announced as a “national policy” when the central government felt confident that it understood how the policy would work. This trial-and-error method had the advantage of creating political space for deliberation among important stakeholders, leading to the success of highly complex initiatives such as China’s national health policy. It also allowed for flexibility, with policies being revised to account for changing conditions or unforeseen side effects. And because these policies were not associated with any one person, the political costs of admitting mistakes were low. Xi has dispensed with such subtleties, announcing policies personally, suddenly, and without much, if any, apparent deliberation. This modus operandi has clearly been economically harmful, even when the motivations behind the policies are benign or well-meaning. Consider the 2021 ban on private tutoring, which was intended to curb the punishing hours that Chinese children spend studying and to reduce wealthier students’ advantages over their peers. But the rollout was so blunt and sudden that it reduced major Chinese education companies’ market capitalizations by tens of billions of dollars and simply created a black market for the same services. The economic ramifications reach beyond education. The possibility of sudden and unanticipated policy changes discourages future investments in all sectors. Another example is Xi’s zero-COVID policy. Though it was very successful in keeping the coronavirus at bay when there were no vaccines, it has fared poorly with changing conditions. While all other countries are shifting back to business as usual – or have already done so – China seems stuck in an endless game of Whac-a-Mole. The implications for the Chinese economy are clear: the authorities should stay the course in terms of economic-policy goals, but change their policymaking methods. Moving slowly and cautiously served China well for more than 40 years. It could work well for many more.",
            "习近平如何才能增强中国经济 发自芝加哥 — — 习近平即将在本月召开的中共第二十次全国代表大会上成为中国历史上第一位连任三届的国家主席。 而这也赋予了我们一个绝佳时机去评估他在过去十年间的经济政策记录并探讨一些能在下一任期提升经济表现的明确举措。 当习近平在2012年就任这一中国最高政治职位时，中国经济正在蓬勃发展，但也存在许多严重问题。 前面十来年GDP都在以年均10%的速度增长，但经济放缓终究是不可避免的，而且自2008年以来GDP增长率确实几乎每年都在下降。 此外不平等状况不断加剧，1990~2000年间基尼系数上升了13 % ， 到本世纪初中国的不平等程度首次超过了美国，这也是自1978年改革以来的头一回。 与此同时污染几乎正在扼杀中国。 2013年时北京每立方米空气中平均含有102微克PM2.5颗粒，而一直背负空气污染恶名的洛杉矶PM2.5读数也只有15左右。 中国城市居民对与污染相关的心肺疾病和早期死亡现象怨声载道。 由工厂、农场和矿场废水导致的水污染现象也困扰着中国。 在农村地区整个村庄和城镇有时不得不迁往异地，因为当地水源已经被不可逆转地污染了。 中国的劳动力也在逐渐减少。 每个妇女生育近6个子女的历史高峰生育率在1970年代开始下降并在2000年达到目前不到两个孩子的水平。 中国的工作适龄群体从1970年占总人口的80%缩减到2012年的仅37 % 。 65岁以上人口比例翻了一番，从1970年的4%增加到2012年的8 % 。 这些趋势都使政府陷于两难境地。 虽然政策制定者需要保持总人口不进一步膨胀，但他们也需要保持年轻工龄人口的供应以支撑不断增多的老年人口。 而社会不满情绪则不断上升，根据一项民调指数，公众对政府腐败的感知在1991年至2012年间翻了一番。 2014年约有1300起罢工事件被记录在案；2016年时这一数字增加了一倍有多，达到2700起。 习近平在上台后花了很大力气来直面这些挑战，但结果却喜忧参半。 从积极方面看过去十年间北京和上海等主要城市的PM2.5读数都已减半，而中国当前的基尼系数已经回落美国水平以下，比2010年的峰值低13 % 。 但其他指标则不那么赏心悦目。 从2012年到新冠疫情爆发前的那段时期中国的年度GDP增长率要么持平，要么下降。 尽管政府已经废除了严格的独生子女政策，但生育率仍然很低。 如今65岁及以上人口的比例接近13 % ， 也是现代中国的一个新高峰。 在习近平发起了一场大受吹捧的反腐运动的十年后，公众对腐败的感知程度却比以往任何时候都要高。 尽管如此，把过去十年的所有成就和失败都归咎于习近平是一种不得要领的做法。 习近平所面临的几大问题都是前任遗留下来的，而这些问题都是中国以往快速增长以及政治和经济历史所产生的不可避免后果。 但同时他也继承了解决这些问题的主要政策方案。 中国早在1994年就开始要求国有能源网投资可再生能源产业，前几届政府也着重推行了好些改善穷人生存条件的政策。 1998年城市地区开始实施基本医疗保险制度并于2003年推广到农村地区。 总体不平等现象在习近平上台之前两年就开始减少，而前几届政府也经常开展反腐行动。 由于习近平延续了其几位前任的许多政策举措，正在改善的事情继续改善，而难以解决的问题仍未解决。 在习近平领导下变化最大的不是表面上的政策目标，而是其执行模式。 除了独生子女政策等少数例外，1978年后到习近平上台前的中国政策制定者都倾向于小心谨慎行事。 一些重要变革（比如农村选举）通常都是先悄悄试行，直到中央政府感到有信心了解该政策如何运作时才会作为“国家政策”正式颁布。 这种试错法的好处是为重要利益相关者之间的协商创造了政治空间，从而使中国的国家医疗政策等高度复杂的举措得以取得成功。 它还存在一定灵活性，可以根据不断变化的状况或未能预见的副作用去修改政策。 同时由于这些政策并未与任何一个人绑定，所以承认错误的政治成本很低。 而习近平则摒弃了这些低调做法，他总是亲自宣布政策，而且是在没有经过多少（如果有的话）明确商议的情况下忽然宣布。 虽然政策背后的动机或许是良好或善意的，但这种做事方法显然是不利于经济的。 以2021年的校外培训禁令为例，其本意是防止孩子把时间全部花在低效学习上，并减少较富裕家庭学生相对同龄人的优势。 但禁令的出台是如此让人措手不及，导致中国各大教育企业市值蒸发了数百亿美元，还直接催生了一个提供相同服务的黑市。 其经济后果溢出了教育领域，出现突发性意外政策变化的可能性阻碍了对所有行业的未来投资。 另一个例子则是习近平的新冠清零政策。 尽管此举在相关疫苗尚未问世时非常成功遏制了病毒，但随着形势的变化它的表现却越来越差。 当其他所有国家都在恢复正常生产生活秩序（或者已经恢复了）的时候，中国却似乎陷入了一个无休止的打地鼠游戏。 这对中国经济的影响相当明显，而当局虽然应该在经济政策目标方面一以贯之，但也得改变其政策制定手段。 40多年来缓慢而谨慎的动作使中国获益良多，而它也可以在更长的时间里发挥良好作用。"

            "China’s Dream World CLAREMONT, CALIFORNIA – Ruling elites almost everywhere – whether in democracies or in authoritarian regimes – believe that clever sloganeering can inspire their people and legitimize their power. There are, of course, crucial differences. In functioning democracies, government leaders can be held accountable for their promises: the press can scrutinize their policies, opposition parties are motivated to show that the party in power lies and cheats. As a result, incumbents are frequently forced to carry out at least some of their promises. Autocratic rulers, by contrast, face no such pressures. Press censorship, repression of dissent, and the absence of organized opposition allow rulers the luxury of promising whatever they want, with no political consequences for failing to deliver. The result is government of the sloganeers, by the sloganeers, and for the sloganeers. China appears to have perfected this form of government over the last decade. The ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP), in response to rising public demand for social justice, has devised numerous slogans, such as “governing for the people,” “building a harmonious society,” “balanced development,” “scientific development,” and so on. Whenever the top leadership in Beijing uttered such slogans, they became the rallying cry of the bureaucracy. The party’s massive propaganda machine went into overdrive and blanketed the country with a publicity blitz that would make the most extravagant Madison Avenue advertising campaign look like child’s play. But government by slogan, whether in China or in other autocracies, seldom achieves its declared goals. In the last decade, GDP growth soared, but most indices of social justice, governance performance, and public welfare deteriorated. Macroeconomic imbalances worsened as economic growth became excessively dependent on investment and exports. Inequality worsened. Official corruption escalated. Social mobility declined. Environmental degradation reached a crisis point. Today, it is the responsibility of China’s new leadership, headed by President Xi Jinping, to avert another decade of missed opportunities. Without missing a beat, Xi, like his predecessors, rolled out a new slogan to inspire popular confidence in his leadership. As a catchphrase for his administration’s objective, “the great renaissance of the Chinese nation” is bit long, but it has lately morphed into the simpler “China Dream.” The substance of the China Dream remains difficult to determine. When Xi first unveiled his slogan after being selected as the CCP’s new general secretary, he defined it in simple, accessible, but nonetheless generic terms: The “Chinese people dream of living the same good life as all other people in the world.” Xi has said little about the China Dream since – and his silence has caused considerable trouble. China’s ever-zealous propaganda officials, evidently fearful of not demonstrating sufficient loyalty and respect for the new party chief, quickly hijacked the slogan; the China Dream has replaced the “China Model” in official political branding. Whatever the new administration does is touted as part of its ambitious effort to make the “China Dream” come true. Unfortunately, China propagandists, who double as censors, have a perverse ability to discredit anything that they try to brand. The China Dream is no exception. So far, public reaction has ranged from puzzlement to derision. After a decade of government by slogan, the Chinese public wants substance. This presents Xi with a real challenge. He has risen to the top by winning friends and allies inside the CCP. Now that he is the leader of a dynamic, diverse, and increasingly demanding society, he must gain popular support and confidence to maintain his credibility and become an effective politician. The first thing that Xi should do is to articulate a clearer, more specific, and inspiring version of the China Dream, and stop letting the CCP’s propaganda officials define it for him. The China Dream may include all of the economic benefits and material comfort that ordinary Chinese desire, but it will not be complete without the human rights and dignity that citizens in civilized societies take for granted. The second thing that Xi and his colleagues need to do is to follow up with specific policies and actions that can bolster the credibility of their declared goals. Political slogans, however high-sounding, become stale when their purveyors fail to make good on their promises. Xi may still be enjoying a honeymoon with the Chinese public, but it is likely to be a short one. His predecessors had ten years to carry out real reforms and accomplished little, leaving the Chinese in no mood to endure another decade of government by shibboleth.",
            "中国的梦想世界 发自加利福尼亚克莱尔蒙特 — — 几乎所有国家（不管是民主还是专制政体）的统治精英都认为漂亮的口号能鼓舞民众并使其权力合法化。 当然，这其中有着关键性的差别。 在实行民主制的国家，政府领导人要为其承诺负责：媒体可以仔细考究其政策，在野党会主动揭发执政党的谎言和骗局。 因此，在位者常常会被迫兑现至少一部分承诺。 相比之下，独裁统治者就无需面对这样的压力。 新闻审查制度、对异见的镇压以及有组织反对派的缺失使得统治者可以任意夸下海口，却无须为诺言的无法兑现承担政治后果。 这就会导致政府由喊口号者组成，被喊口号者把持，并只为那些喊口号者服务。 中国在过去十年间似乎已经完善了这种政府形式。 执政的中国共产党为了回应公众对社会正义日益增长的需求，已经设计了众多口号，比如“执政为民 ” 、 “构建和谐社会 ” 、 “平衡发展”及“科学发展”等等。 不管北京的最高层领导何时提出这样的口号，它们都会成为官僚机构的战斗口号。 中共的庞大宣传机器随之开始急速运转，用宣传闪电战地毯式轰炸整个国家，其情景简直让纽约麦迪逊大道上的广告宣传活动看起来像小孩玩的游戏。 但空喊口号的政府，无论是在中国还是在其它独裁国家，很少能达到其宣称的目标。 在过去的十年，中国GDP实现了高速增长，但社会正义、治理绩效和公共福利的大部分指标反而都恶化了。 随着经济增长变得过度依赖投资和出口，宏观经济失衡状况不断恶化。 社会不平等状况也在加剧。 官员腐败升级。 社会流动性下降。 环境恶化则到达了一个危机爆发点。 如今，避免接下来的十年继续错失时机的责任落在了以习近平主席为首的新一代领导层肩上。 紧随其前任的步调，新主席很快推出了一个新口号来激发公众对其领导能力的信心。 作为行政目标的宣传语 ， “ 中华民族的伟大复兴”有点长了，但它最近被改成了较为简单的“中国梦 ” 。 但中国梦的实质内容仍然难以确定。 在习近平被选为新任中共总书记后首次公布其口号时，他用简单，容易理解，但依然笼统的术语来定义中国梦：即“中国人民过上和世界其他国家人民一样美好生活的梦想 。 ” 自那以后习近平很少谈及中国梦 — — 而其沉默已经造成了相当大的麻烦。 一向狂热的中国宣传部门官员显然害怕自己没有对新的党委总书记展示足够的忠诚和尊重，很快就劫持了这个口号；中国梦已经取代了官方政治宣传中的“中国模式”标牌。 不管新政府干了些什么，都会被吹捧为是立志为让“中国梦”成真而努力。 不幸地是，中国的宣传者 — — 还同时兼任审查者 — — 拥有一种抹黑任何他们想要打造的招牌的怪异能力。 如今的中国梦也不例外。 迄今为止，公众反应从迷惑转为了嘲笑。 在经历了十年的口号统治之后，中国民众想要一些实质性的进展。 这给习主席提出了真正的挑战。 他通过在共产党内部赢得朋友和盟友攀上了权力顶峰。 如今他领导着一个动态、多元且要求越来越高的社会，他必须获得公众的支持和信心以维持其信誉并成为一个拿得出政绩的政治家。 习近平应该做的第一件事情是要明确给出一个更清晰、更具体且鼓舞人心的中国梦版本，并阻止中共宣传官员代他去下定义。 中国梦可以包含所有普通中国人想要的经济利益和物质需求，但如果缺乏文明社会公民视为理所当然的人权和尊严，中国梦就会是一个不完整的理念。 习近平及其同僚应该做的第二件事则是跟进实施可以支撑其宣传目标可信度的具体政策和行动。 政治口号 — — 无论多么高调，当许诺者不能兑现其承诺时都会变味。 习可能还正与中国的民众享受着他们之间的美好“蜜月 ” ， 但这个“蜜月”期会很短。 他的前任有十年的时间来实施真正的改革但只实现了很小一部分，这使得中国人失去了再次忍受十年空喊口号的信心。"

            "China’s Economy Is Rotting from the Head BOSTON – China highlights a long-debated question about economic development: Can a top-down autocracy outperform liberal market economies in terms of innovation and growth? Between 1980 and 2019, China’s average annual GDP growth rate was over 8% – faster than any Western economy – and in the 2000s, its economic trajectory exceeded mere catch-up growth (using Western technologies). China started making its own technology investments, producing patents and academic publications, and spawning innovative companies such as Alibaba, Tencent, Baidu, and Huawei. Some naysayers had thought this unlikely. While plenty of autocrats had presided over rapid economic expansions, never before had a non-democratic regime generated sustained, innovation-based growth. Some Westerners were mesmerized by Soviet scientific prowess in the 1950s and 1960s, but often they were channeling their own biases. By the 1970s, the Soviet Union was clearly falling behind and stagnating, owing to its inability to innovate across a broad range of sectors. True, some astute China observers pointed out that the Communist Party of China’s iron grip did not bode well for the country’s prospects. But the more common view was that China would sustain its astonishing growth. While there were debates over whether China would be a benign or malign force globally, there was little disagreement that its growth was unstoppable. The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank made a habit of projecting past Chinese growth rates into the future, and books with titles like When China Rules the World proliferated. For years, one also heard arguments that China had achieved “accountability without democracy,” or that the CPC leadership was at least constrained by term limits, a balance of powers, and other good-governance stopgaps. China won praise for demonstrating the virtue of government planning and offering an alternative to the neoliberal Washington Consensus. Even those who recognized China’s model as a form of “state capitalism” – with all the contradictions that entails – projected that its growth would continue largely unabated. Perhaps the most potent argument was that China would control the world by dint of its ability to achieve global dominance in artificial intelligence. With access to so much data from its massive population, with fewer ethical and privacy restrictions than those faced by researchers in the West, and with so much state investment in AI, China was said to have an obvious advantage in this domain. But this argument was always suspect. One cannot simply assume that advances in AI will be the main source of economic advantage in the future; that the Chinese government will allow for ongoing high-quality research in the sector; or that Western companies are significantly hampered by privacy and other data regulations. China’s prospects today look far less rosy than they once did. Having already eliminated many internal checks, President Xi Jinping used the CPC’s 20th National Congress to secure an unprecedented third term (with no future term limits in sight), and stacked the all-powerful Politburo Standing Committee with loyal supporters. This consolidation of power comes despite major unforced errors by Xi that are dragging down the economy and sapping China’s innovative potential. Xi’s “zero-COVID” policy was largely avoidable and has come at significant cost, as has his support for Russia’s war in Ukraine. Even more and greater blunders are likely to follow now that Xi wields unchecked power and is surrounded by yes-men who will avoid telling him what he needs to hear. But it would be a mistake to conclude that China’s growth model is crumbling just because the wrong person ascended the throne. The turn toward a harder line of control that started during Xi’s first term (after 2012) may have been inevitable. China’s rapid industrial growth in the 1990s and 2000s was built on huge investments, technology transfers from the West, production for export, and financial and wage repression. But such export-led growth can go only so far. As Xi’s predecessor, Hu Jintao, recognized in 2012, China’s growth would have to become “much more balanced, coordinated, and sustainable,” with far less reliance on external demand and much greater reliance on domestic consumption. At the time, many experts believed that Xi would respond to the challenge with an “ambitious reform agenda” to introduce more market-based incentives. But these interpretations overlooked a key question that China’s regime was already grappling with: how to maintain the CPC’s political monopoly in the face of a rapidly expanding, economically empowered middle-class. The most obvious answer – and perhaps the only answer – was greater repression and censorship, which is exactly the path Xi took. For a while, Xi, his entourage, and even many outside experts believed that the economy could still flourish under conditions of tightening central control, censorship, indoctrination, and repression. Again, many looked to AI as an unprecedentedly powerful tool for monitoring and controlling society. Yet there is mounting evidence to suggest that Xi and advisers misread the situation, and that China is poised to pay a hefty economic price for the regime’s intensifying control. Following sweeping regulatory crackdowns on Alibaba, Tencent, and others in 2021, Chinese companies are increasingly focused on remaining in the political authorities’ good graces, rather than on innovating. The inefficiencies and other problems created by the politically motivated allocation of credit are also piling up, and state-led innovation is starting to reach its limits. Despite a large increase in government support since 2013, the quality of Chinese academic research is improving only slowly. Even in AI, the government’s top scientific priority, advances are lagging behind the global tech leaders – most of them in the United States. My own recent research with Jie Zhou of MIT and David Yang of Harvard University shows that the top-down control in Chinese academia is distorting the direction of research, too. Many faculty members are choosing their research areas to curry favor with heads of departments or deans, who have considerable power over their careers. As they shift their priorities, the evidence suggests that the overall quality of research is suffering. Xi’s tightening grip over science and the economy means that these problems will intensify. And as is true in all autocracies, no independent experts or domestic media will speak up about the train wreck he has set in motion.",
            "从顶上开始腐烂的中国经济 发自波士顿 — — 中国凸显了一个人们长期争论不休的经济发展问题：一个自上而下专制的国家能否在创新和增长方面赢过自由市场经济体？ 在1980至2019年间中国的年均GDP增长率超过了8 % — —高于所有西方经济体，同时其其经济轨迹在2000年代（借助西方技术）超越了单纯的追赶式增长。 中国开始实施自己的技术投资，发布专利和学术出版物，还催生了阿里巴巴、腾讯、百度和华为等诸多创新企业。 一些持反对意见者认为这不太可能。 虽然在很多专制领导人治下都实现过经济的快速扩张，但还从来没有一个非民主政权产生过持续且基于创新的增长。 一些西方人在1950和1960年代着迷于苏联的科学实力，但这往往都是他们自己的偏见作祟。 1970年代时苏联明显已经落后并陷入停滞，因为它没有能力在各行各业中实施创新。 虽然有一些机敏的中国观察家指出中国共产党的铁腕统治对该国的前景来说并不是个好兆头。 但更普遍的看法是中国仍将维持其惊人的增长。 虽然对中国将在全球范围内成为一股良性还是恶性的势力存在争论，但对中国的增长不可阻挡这一观点却几乎没有异议。 国际货币基金组织和世界银行都惯于参照中国过往的增长率进行预测，而《当中国统治世界》这类书籍也大量涌现。 多年来人们还听过这样的论调，认为中国已经实现了“没有民主的问责制”或者中共领导层至少受到了连任限制、权力制衡和其他权宜善治措施的制约。 中国因为展现了政府规划的优点并为新自由主义的华盛顿共识提供了一个替代方案而受到赞誉。 即便是那些认为中国模式是某种形式的“国家资本主义 ” — —纵有由此产生的所有矛盾 — — 的人也预测中国的增长将大体延续下去。 而其中最有力的论点或许是中国将凭借其在人工智能领域占据全球主导地位的能力来控制整个世界。 由于可以从其庞大人口中获得海量数据，拥有比西方国家研究人员更少的道德和隐私限制，同时国家还对人工智能实施了巨额投资，据称中国在这个领域享有明显优势。 但这种说法总是令人生疑，因为我们不能简单地认定在人工智能方面的进步就是未来经济优势的主要来源，中国政府会允许在该领域进行持续的高质量研究，或是西方企业受到了隐私和其他数据规定的严重掣肘。 中国当前的前景看起来已经远没有以往那么乐观了。 已然消除了多项内部制衡的中国国家主席习近平利用中国共产党第二十次全国代表大会获得了史无前例的第三个任期（而且在可见的未来并未出台任何任期限制 ） ， 还把许多忠诚支持者安插在了总揽大权的政治局常务委员会中。 尽管习近平犯下了一些重大的非受迫性失误，拖累了经济，削弱了中国的创新潜力，但他的权力还是得到了巩固。 习近平的“新冠清零”政策本来在很大程度上可以避免且引发了巨大的代价，他对俄罗斯对乌克兰战争的支持也是如此。 如今他掌握了不受制约的权力而且身边充斥着一些不愿告知其真相的应声虫，因此更多更大的失误可能会接踵而来。 但如果仅仅因为错误的人登上了王位就断定中国的增长模式正在崩溃也是错误的。 在习近平在其第一任期内（2012年后）开始转向更强硬控制路线的做法或许是不可避免的。 中国1990年代和21世纪的快速工业增长是建立在巨大的投资、来自西方的技术转让、出口型生产以及金融和工资压制之上的。 但这种出口导向的增长只能止步于此。 正如习近平的前任胡锦涛在2012年所认识到的那样，中国的增长必须变得“更加全面、协调和可持续 ” ， 要大幅减少对外部需求的依赖并大力提升对国内消费的依存度。 当时许多专家认为习近平将以一个引入更多市场导向型激励措施的“雄心勃勃改革议程”来应对这一挑战。 但这些解释忽略了中国政权已经在努力设法解决的一个关键问题：如何在迅速扩大且得到经济赋权的中产阶级面前维持中共的政治垄断。 对此最明显的答案 — — 或许也是唯一的答案 — — 就是加强镇压和审查，而这也正是习近平所走的道路。 有一段时间习近平及其追随者甚至许多外部专家都认为经济仍然可以在日益强化中央控制、审查，灌输和压制的条件下蓬勃发展。 同样也有许多人将人工智能视为一个监视和控制社会的空前强大工具。 然而越来越多的证据表明习近平和他的顾问们误读了形势，同时中国宁愿为政权的强化控制付出沉重的经济代价。 在2021年阿里巴巴、腾讯及其他企业遭遇全面监管打击后中国企业变得越来越注重与政治当局搞好关系而非创新。 出于政治动机的信贷分配所造成的低效率和其他问题也在不断累积，国家主导的创新开始碰到天花板。 尽管自2013年以来政府的支持大幅增加，但中国学术研究的质量只取得了缓慢的提升。 即使是在政府最优先发展的人工智能领域，其进展也落后于其他全球技术领导企业 — — 其中大部分都位于美国。 我自己最近与麻省理工学院周婕（音译）和哈佛大学杨宇凡的共同研究表明对中国学术界的自上而下控制也在扭曲研究方向。 许多教师对研究领域的选择只是为了讨好那些有权左右自身学术生涯的系主任或院长。 随着他们将优先事项转向这些方面，有证据表明研究的整体质量正在受到影响。 习近平对科学和经济的严格控制意味着这些问题将会加剧。 正如所有专制国家一样，没有任何独立专家或国内媒体能出言制止这场他亲手驱动的巨大灾难。"

            "Will China Weaponize Social Media? ATLANTA – Ever since the 2016 US presidential election, with its revelations about Russian meddling, European officials have been on the lookout for similar attacks. But Europeans aren’t the only ones paying attention. So, too, are China’s leaders, who are considering what they might learn from the Kremlin’s successes. For Chinese President Xi Jinping, maintaining domestic stability is a top priority, a point underscored by China’s annual budget for internal security. At well over $100 billion, the official number is low. Like defense outlays, the real number is much higher, owing to hidden spending, including on research and development. For example, China is exploring how artificial intelligence (AI) and big data can be used to monitor everything from social media to credit-card spending, and it plans to assign all citizens a social-reliability rating to weed out potential troublemakers. The regime’s Orwellian strategy is focused squarely on social media and controlling not just what is said, but also how information flows into and around the country. Moreover, the authorities are bringing technology companies into line with tough new laws and cyber-security investigations. For Xi, the ease with which the Kremlin has manipulated Facebook and Twitter demonstrates the need for a tighter grip on China’s own social-media platforms. The Chinese government is now requesting seats on the boards of companies such as WeChat, Weibo, and Tencent, and demanding access to their users’ personal data. Chinese cyber spies are also studying Russia’s success. To be sure, Chinese hackers do not lack technical savvy. They have launched cyberattacks against US presidential campaigns, expatriate Tibetan movements, and Uighur activists. They have burrowed into Western think tanks and universities that study China. They have even hacked into Western news outlets that published embarrassing stories about Chinese leaders’ wealth. Still, the Chinese may have something to learn from Russia’s well-choreographed online army of trolls and bots. Similarly, strategists at the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) are likely poring over the Kremlin’s handiwork to inform their own cyber-war tactics. Chinese strategic thinking about “political warfare” holds that an adversary’s political, social, and economic institutions – particularly the media – should be targeted before a shooting war ever begins. To that end, Russia’s diffusion of bogus news and conspiracy theories through its state-funded media outlets RT and Sputnik could prove instructive. In addition to expanding China’s cyber capabilities, Xi has also been developing China’s soft power through economic, social, cultural, and media initiatives. And although he has not yet coupled these programs with China’s clandestine forces to launch the kind of audacious attack that roiled the 2016 presidential election, he clearly is establishing the means to do so. Recently, it was revealed that China has been conducting wide-ranging influence operations in Australia, using official campus organizations to monitor Chinese college students, business associations to tout Chinese interests, and diplomats to police local Chinese-language media. Late last year, an Australian senator was forced to resign over his alleged ties to a Chinese billionaire. China is also expanding its global media presence. By some estimates, the government is sinking some $7 billion into new media and broadcast outlets abroad every year. Its official news agency, Xinhua, has more than 170 bureaus around the world and publishes in eight languages. China Central Television (CCTV) has more than 70 foreign bureaus and broadcasts to 171 countries in six languages. China Radio International is the world’s second-largest radio broadcaster after the BBC, broadcasting in 64 languages from 32 foreign bureaus to 90 radio stations worldwide. None of these organizations has yet to distinguish itself as a go-to international news source. But they have become a significant source of information for people in underserved regions such as the Middle East and Africa, where they purvey China’s views and are building sympathetic audiences. At the same time, China is purchasing “native advertising” in Australian, American, and European newspapers. This allows China to place officially authored content about controversial issues – such as its militarized island-building in the South China Sea – next to those publications’ editorial offerings. Xi is also playing the long game, by approving investments in movies and other forms of mass entertainment to influence how global popular culture treats all things Chinese. Despite the Chinese government’s recent clampdown on outbound capital flows, Chinese companies are still adding to their major stakes in Hollywood properties. The Chinese conglomerate Dalien Wanda alone has some $10 billion in entertainment assets in the United States, Europe, and Australia. And other Chinese Internet and financial giants such as Alibaba, Tencent, and Hony Capital, as well as state-owned companies such as the China Film Group, have invested tens of billions of dollars in US film ventures. With these financial stakes, the Chinese government has leverage that goes beyond old-fashioned censorship. Hollywood studio bosses with an eye on China’s massive domestic market will be tempted to kowtow to the government’s “creative” requests when it comes to scripts, casting decisions, and so forth. At $8.6 billion in 2017, Chinese box-office receipts are second only to North America’s. Yet China allows only 38 foreign films into the country each year, inducing filmmakers to bend over backward to please the censors. Of course, Hollywood executives aren’t the only Westerners helping Xi’s realize his agenda. Between Apple’s recent decision to relinquish its Chinese user data storage to a Chinese partner and Google’s announcement that it will site a new AI research center in China, US technology giants are not just making deals to benefit their “stakeholders.” They are also handing Xi and his cyber operatives proprietary technologies and know-how, and even potential access to US targets. This raises an obvious question: If Russia could roil a US presidential election without such intimate business relationships, what will China be able to do in the years ahead? To think that China’s only interest is making money, one Hollywood executive recently acknowledged, would be “very naive and dangerous” indeed.",
            "中国会将社交媒体武器化吗？ 亚特兰大—2016年美国总统选举以来，随着俄罗斯干预大选行为的披露，欧洲官员也暴露在类似的攻击风险中。 但欧洲人不是唯一保持关注的群体。 中国领导人也在保持关注，他们正在考虑或许可以从克里姆林宫的成功中汲取经验。 对中国国家主席习近平而言，保持国内稳定是第一要务，者从中国年度维稳预算中可见一斑。 官方数字是1,000亿美元以上，一点也不高。 和防务支出一样，拜包括研发在内的隐藏支出所赐，实际数字要高得多。 比如，中国正在探索如何运用人工智能和的数据来监控从社交媒体到信用卡支付的一切，还计划给所有公民进行社会可靠性评级，以挖掘潜在的麻烦制造者。 体制的奥威尔主义（Orwellian）战略的核心关注点是社交媒体，不但要控制说什么，还要控制信息如何在全国流动。 此外，当局要求科技公司遵守严苛的新法律和网络安全调查。 对习近平来说，克里姆林宫能够轻易操纵脸谱和推特表明中国有必要抓紧控制自己的社交媒体平台。 中国政府现在要求在微信、微博和腾讯等公司董事会安排董事，还要求接触用户个人数据。 中国网络间谍也在研究俄罗斯的成功。 平心而论，中国黑客并不缺乏技术。 他们发动过针对美国总统选战、流亡西藏独立运动和维吾尔活跃分子的网络攻击。 他们还潜入研究中国的西方智库和大学。 他们甚至入侵了报道中国领导人财富丑闻的西方新闻机构。 尽管如此，中国仍然可以从俄罗斯处心积虑构建的滚轮和机器人网络大军中汲取经验。 类似地，解放军参谋们也可能正在仔细研究克里姆林宫的做法，来充实自己的网络战战术。 中国“政治战”的战略思维认为，敌方的政治、社会和经济机构 — — 特别是媒体 — — 应该在战争打响前先行打击。 在这方面，俄罗斯通过国家拨款的媒体机构RT和Sputnik来散播假新闻和阴谋论，对中国很有教育意义。 除了扩大中国的网络实力，习近平也在通过经济、社会、文化和媒体计划发展中国的软实力。 他尚未将这些计划与中国发动类似于颠覆2016年总统选举这样的大胆攻击的秘密力量组合起来，但他显然正在建立这样做的办法。 据披露，最近中国一直在澳大利亚进行大范围影响力行动，用官方校园组织监控中国大学生、利用商会来推进中国利益，利用外交官来管理本地中文媒体。 去年年底，一位澳大利亚参议员因为与一位中国亿万富豪扯上了关系而被迫辞职。 中国也在增加其在全球媒体中的露脸机会。 据一些估算，中国政府每年大约要花70亿美元用于新媒体和传播组织。 其官方新闻机构新华社在全球有170多个分社，用八种语言发布消息。 中国中央电视台拥有70个海外记者站，用六种语言向171个国家播出节目。 中国国际广播电台是仅次于BBC的世界第二大广播台，在从32家外国分台用64种语言向全世界播送广播。 所有这些组织都不认为自己是时兴的国际新闻源。 但它们已经成为中东和非洲等广播服务稀缺地区的人民的重要信息源，在这些地区传播中国的观点，建立有同理心的受众群。 与此同时，中国在澳大利亚、美国和欧洲报纸购买“本地广告 ” 。 如此，中国就能让官方授意的争议问题内容 — — 如在南海军事化的造岛行为 — — 和这些报纸的社论并列出现。 习近平还在从长计议，批准投资电影和其他形式的大众娱乐来影响全球流行文化对待中国元素的方式。 尽管中国政府最近阻止资本外流，但中资公司仍在大举收购好莱坞企业的多数股份。 光是万达集团就在美国、欧洲和澳大利亚拥有价值100亿美元的娱乐资产。 其他中国互联网和金融巨头，如阿里巴巴、腾讯和弘毅资本，以及中国电影集团等国有企业，都耗资数百亿美元投资于美国电影产业。 在投入了如此巨资后，中国政府就有了比老掉牙的审查更大的影响力。 好莱坞制作公司的老板们觊觎巨大的中国国内市场，将会为五斗米折腰，遵从中国政府在剧本、选角等方面的“创造性”要求。 2017年，中国票房收入高达86亿美元，仅次于北美。 但中国每年只允许引进38部外国影片，这让制片商竞相折腰取悦审查者。 当然，好莱坞高管们并不是帮助习近平实现自己的日程的唯一的西方人。 最近苹果决定将中国用户数据储存转交给中国合作企业来进行，而谷歌也宣布将在中国建立一个新人工智能研究中心，这说明美国科技巨头不仅仅在设法让它们的“相关利益方”获益。 它们还在向习近平和他的网络计划提供专利技术和知识，甚至直达美国目标的可能渠道。 这引出了一个显而易见的问题：如果说俄罗斯在不具有如此紧密的商业关系就可以颠覆美国总统选举，那么中国在未来几年中能够做到什么？ 一位好莱坞高管最近承认，认为中国唯一的兴趣是挣钱，这真的“非常幼稚和危险 。 ”"

            "Biden, Xi, and the Evolution of Cooperation CLAREMONT, CALIFORNIA – I don’t know whether US President Joe Biden, Chinese President Xi Jinping, and their foreign-policy advisers have read Robert Axelrod’s classic book on international relations,The Evolution of Cooperation. But they should heed Axelrod’s central insight about how countries can benefit from cooperation and punish cheating. Through countless simulations, Axelrod – now a professor emeritus at the University of Michigan – found that the most beneficial long-term strategy for an actor such as a nation-state is to cooperate first and then play tit-for-tat. In other words, a country will gain in the long run if it offers a goodwill gesture and then responds in kind to its opponent’s subsequent moves. This insight is especially applicable to today’s US-China stalemate. Although both Biden and Xi know that their countries are in an open-ended geopolitical rivalry, they also want to put guardrails around it in order to avert potential catastrophes, such as a runaway arms race or a direct military conflict. True, in the short term, both leaders have far more urgent priorities than de-escalating bilateral tensions. Biden needs to repair the damage to American democracy and society caused by Donald Trump’s one-term presidency, while Xi plans to reorient the Chinese economy to make it less vulnerable to “decoupling” with the United States. But Biden and Xi appear to face the same dilemma: whether to be the first to extend an olive branch with the aim of stabilizing bilateral relations in the short term and gaining an enduring strategic edge in the bilateral rivalry. Biden faces strong bipartisan opposition in Washington to undoing Trump’s policies toward China, such as tariffs and sanctions against Chinese technology firms. And although Xi may be more eager to end the free fall in Sino-American relations, he has been reluctant to make any substantive moves to demonstrate goodwill. Instead, China has intensified its crackdown in Hong Kong this year, and the Chinese military is continuing its campaign of intimidation and harassment against Taiwan. If neither Biden nor Xi wants to risk any political capital to make the first move, the US-China relationship is highly likely to worsen further. On the national-security front, the two countries’ militaries are busy preparing for a face-off, creating a dangerous dynamic of deterrence and counter-deterrence. Diplomatically, Biden will soon seek to rally America’s democratic allies to confront China, a move Xi implicitly denounced in his recent address to this year’s World Economic Forum annual meeting. Economic tensions also could escalate, because China seems unlikely to be able to meet the target for additional purchases of US products set in the “phase one” trade deal that Xi’s government concluded with the Trump administration a year ago. In the meantime, continuing human-rights abuses in Hong Kong and against the predominantly Muslim Uighur minority in Xinjiang will fuel demands in Washington for additional sanctions against China’s political leaders and economic entities. The only way to prevent a new round of deterioration in US-China relations is for either Biden or Xi to take the first concrete step signaling willingness to cooperate, and then adhere strictly to the reciprocity rule thereafter. The costs of making the first move are likely modest, but the potential long-term payoff could be disproportionately large. Although the two countries would remain strategic competitors, their rivalry would be based on more stable expectations and mutually accepted rules. Cooperation in areas of shared interest, in particular climate change, would be possible. Most important, the de-escalation of tensions would reduce the risk of a catastrophic military conflict. If US and Chinese leaders find Axelrod’s insight compelling enough to translate into actual policy, their next challenge is to figure out what their respective first moves should be, given uncertainty about the other side’s response. Since the long-entrenched Xi seems to have more room to maneuver than Biden, he is better positioned to take the initiative. Moreover, he has a rich menu of options to demonstrate goodwill – and likely elicit a positive US reaction – without risking too much political capital. For example, China should immediately allow the return of the American journalists it expelled last year in response to US restrictions on reporters working for state-run Chinese media outlets in the US. Another possibility would be to dismiss the charges against the 53 pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong arrested in early January. Releasing a non-trivial number of arbitrarily detained Uighurs on grounds of poor health – or, to use China’s official rationale for holding them, completion of “vocational training” – would signal Xi’s pragmatism in dealing with arguably the most difficult bilateral issue. Likewise, suspending provocative incursions by Chinese warplanes into Taiwan’s air defense identification zone would help sides both to mitigate the risk of an accidental conflict and defuse tensions with the US. Whether Biden would respond to any of these gestures positively is unknown. But Xi should try. China has little to lose, and potentially a lot to gain.",
            "拜登，习近平，以及合作的进化 发自加州克莱蒙特市—我不知道美国总统拜登、中国国家主席习近平以及他们的外交政策顾问们是否读过罗伯特·阿克塞尔罗德（Robert Axelrod）关于国际关系的经典著作《合作的进化 》 ， 但他们很有必要留意阿克塞尔罗德关于各国如何从合作和惩罚作弊行为中获益的核心见解。 通过无数次的模拟，阿克塞尔罗德（现为密歇根大学名誉教授）发现，对于民族国家这类行动方来说最有利的长期战略是先寻求合作，然后再针对对方的回应实施相应举措。 换句话说，如果一个国家先拿出善意的姿态，然后再对对方的后续举动做出类似回应，那么对这个国家的长远发展是有利的。 这一见解尤其适用于当前的中美僵局。 尽管拜登和习近平都知道自己的国家正处于暂时看不要尽头的地缘政治竞争中，但他们也希望在周围设置防护栏以避免一些潜在的大灾难，比如失控的军备竞赛或直接军事冲突。 无可否认，在短期内两国领导人案头都有比缓和双边紧张关系更为紧迫的事情要做。 拜登需要修复特朗普4年总统任期对美国民主和社会造成的破坏，而习近平则计划调整中国经济的方向以减少与美国“脱钩”所产生的冲击。 但拜登和习近平似乎都面临着同样的两难选择：是否应该率先伸出橄榄枝以期在短期内稳定双边关系，并以此在双边竞争中获得持久的战略优势。 如果拜登想撤销特朗普的对华政策（比如对中国科技企业的关税和制裁 ） ， 那么他必将在华盛顿遭遇来自两党的强烈反对。 而尽管习近平可能更渴望终结中美关系的自由落体状态，但他一直不愿意采取任何实质性举措来展示善意。 相反中国今年加大了对香港的打压力度，中国军方也持续在对台湾进行恐吓和骚扰。 倘若拜登和习近平都不愿冒着丢失任何政治资本的风险去迈出第一步，那么中美关系极有可能进一步恶化。 在国家安全方面两国军队都在忙于准备对峙，形成了一个威慑与反威慑的危险态势。 而在外交方面，拜登很快就会尝试动员其民主国家盟友去与中国对抗，习近平则于最近在本年度世界经济论坛年会上的讲话中不点名地谴责了这一举措。 经济紧张局势也可能升级，因为中国似乎不太可能达到习近平政府一年前在与特朗普政府的“第一阶段”贸易协议中所订立的美国产品增加采购目标。 与此同时香港和新疆大多信奉伊斯兰教的维吾尔少数民族的人权依旧遭受着侵犯，这将刺激华盛顿要求对中国政治领导人和经济实体实施更多制裁。 防止中美关系新一轮恶化的唯一办法就是拜登或习近平率先拿出具体措施表达合作意愿，然后严格遵守对等原则。 走出第一步的成本可能不大，但却可能获取远超于此的长期潜在回报。 虽然两国仍将是战略竞争对手，但它们的竞争将建立在更稳定的预期和相互接受的规则基础上，并可能在一些共同关心的领域 — — 特别是气候变化领域 — — 开展合作。 而最重要的是紧张局势的缓和将降低灾难性军事冲突的风险。 如果美国和中国领导人认为阿克塞尔罗德的见解足够令人信服并可以转化为实际的政策，那么他们的下一个挑战就是在不确定对方将如何应对的情况下拿出什么样的第一步行动。 鉴于执政基础更为深厚的习近平似乎拥有比拜登更大的回旋余地，他也更有条件去掌握主动。 此外他还有多种选项可以用来展示善意 — — 并很可能引发美国的积极回应 — — 而不至于冒太大的政治风险。 举个例子，中国可以立即撤销因去年美国对中国国营媒体驻美记者施加限制而对美国媒体驻华记者下达的驱逐出境令，另一种可能则是撤销对1月初在香港被捕的53名民运人士的起诉。 以健康状况不佳为由 — — 或者按照这些人已经完成了“教育培训”的官方留置说法 — — 释放相当数量被无理拘留的维吾尔人可以表现习近平在处理这一可谓最棘手双边问题时的务实态度。 同样，暂停中国战机对台湾防空识别区的挑衅性入侵既有助于减少两岸爆发意外冲突的风险，也有利于化解与美国的紧张关系。 虽然我们不知道拜登是否会对这些姿态做出积极回应，但习近平应该尝试一下。 中国几乎没有什么损失，但却可能会有很多收获。"

            "Xi Jinping’s Vision for Global Governance NEW YORK – The contrast between the disarray in the West, on open display at the NATO summit and at last month’s G7 meeting in Canada, and China’s mounting international self-confidence is growing clearer by the day. Last month, the Communist Party of China (CPC) concluded its Central Conference on Work Relating to Foreign Affairs, the second since Xi Jinping became China’s undisputed ruler in 2012. These meetings are not everyday affairs. They are the clearest expression of how the leadership sees China’s place in the world, but they tell the world much about China as well. The last such conference, in 2014, marked the funeral of Deng Xiaoping’s dictum of “hide your strength, bide your time, never take the lead,” and heralded a new era of international activism. In part, this change reflected Xi’s centralization of control, Chinese leaders’ conclusion that American power is in relative decline, and their view that China had become an indispensable global economic player. Since 2014, China has expanded and consolidated its military position in the South China Sea. It took the idea of the New Silk Road and turned it into a multi-trillion-dollar trade, investment, infrastructure, and wider geopolitical/geo-economic initiative, engaging 73 different countries across much of Eurasia, Africa and beyond. And China signed up most of the developed world to the first large-scale non-Bretton Woods multilateral development bank, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. China has also launched diplomatic initiatives beyond its immediate sphere of strategic interest in East Asia, as well as actively participating in initiatives such as the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. It has developed naval bases in Sri Lanka, Pakistan, and Djibouti, and participates in naval exercises with Russia as far away as the Mediterranean and the Baltic. In March, China established its own international development agency. The emergence of a coherent grand strategy (regardless of whether the West chooses to recognize it as such) is not all that has changed since 2014. For starters, the emphasis on the CPC’s role is much stronger than before. Xi, concerned that the party had become marginal to the country’s major policy debates, has reasserted party control over state institutions and given precedence to political ideology over technocratic policymaking. Xi is determined to defy the trend-line of Western history, to see off Francis Fukuyama’s “end of history” culminating in the general triumph of liberal democratic capitalism, and preserve a Leninist state for the long term. This approach – known as “Xi Jinping Thought” – now suffuses China’s foreign policy framework. In particular, Xi’s view that that there are identifiable immutable “laws” of historical development, both prescriptive and predictive, was particularly prominent at last month’s foreign policy conference. If this sounds like old-fashioned dialectical materialism, that’s because it is. Xi embraces the Marxist-Leninist tradition as his preferred intellectual framework. Given its emphasis on iron laws of political and economic development, a dialectical-materialist worldview means that there is nothing random about world events. So, Xi argues, if Marx’s analytical framework is applied to the current period, it is clear that the global order is at a turning point, with the West’s relative decline coinciding with the fortuitous national and international circumstances enabling China’s rise. In Xi’s words, “China has been in the best period of development since modern times, while the world is undergoing the most profound and unprecedented changes in a century.” Of course, formidable obstacles lie ahead for China. But Xi has concluded that the obstacles facing the US and the West are greater. How such thinking will now drive China’s concrete foreign policy is anyone’s guess. But how one-party states, particularly Marxist states, choose to “ideate” reality matters a great deal: it is how the system speaks to itself. And Xi’s message to China’s foreign policy elite is one of great confidence. Specifically, the Central Conference called for the country’s international policy institutions and personnel to embrace Xi’s agenda. Here Xi seems to have the foreign ministry in his sights. There is a strong ideological flavor to Xi’s apparent frustration with the ministry’s glacial approach to policy innovation. China’s diplomats were urged to bear in mind that they are first and foremost “party cadres,” suggesting that Xi is likely to push the foreign policy apparatus toward greater activism, to give full effect to his emerging global vision. The biggest change to emerge from last month’s conference concerns global governance. In 2014, Xi referred to an impending struggle for the future structure of the international order. While he did not elaborate, much work has since been devoted to three inter-related concepts: guoji zhixu (the international order); guoji xitong (the international system), and quanqiu zhili (global governance). Of course, these terms have different and overlapping meanings in English, too. But, broadly speaking, in Chinese, the term “international order” refers to a combination of the United Nations, the Bretton Woods Institutions, the G20, and other multilateral institutions (which China accepts), as well as the US system of global alliances (which China does not). The term “international system” tends to refer to the first half of this international order: the complex web of multilateral institutions that operate under international treaty law and seek to govern the global commons on the basis of the principle of shared sovereignty. And “global governance” denotes the actual performance of the “international system” so defined. What is startlingly new about Xi’s remarks at the Central Conference was his call for China now to “lead the reform of the global governance system with the concepts of fairness and justice.” This is by far the most direct statement of China’s intentions on this important question offered so far. The world should buckle up and get ready for a new wave of Chinese international policy activism. Like much of the rest of the international community, China is acutely conscious of the dysfunctionality of much of the current multilateral system. So Xi’s wish to lead “reform of the global governance system” is no accident. It reflects growing diplomatic activism in multilateral institutions, in order to reorient them in a direction more compatible with what China regards as its “core national interests.” Xi has reminded China’s international policy elite that the totality of China’s future foreign policy direction, including the reform of global governance, must be driven by these core national interests. In this context, China also wants a more “multipolar” international system. This is code for a world in which the role of the United States and the West is substantially reduced. The challenge for the rest of the international community is to define what type of global order we now want. What do existing institutions like the European Union, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or the African Union want for the international rules-based system for the future? What exactly does the US want, with or without Trump? And how will we collectively preserve the global values embodied in the UN Charter, the Bretton Woods institutions, and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights? The future of the global order is in a state of flux. China has a clear script for the future. It’s time for the rest of the international community to develop one of its own.

            "习近平的全球治理视野 发自纽约 — — 在北约峰会以及上月加拿大G7会议上公开展现出来的西方混乱状态，与中国日益增强的国际自信之间的对比日益明显。 上个月中共召开了中央外事工作会议，也是习近平自2012年坐稳最高领袖大位以来第二次召开此会议。 这些会议绝非日常事务，而是关于领导层如何看待中国全球地位的最清晰表达，同时也向世界传达了许多关于中国的信息。 2014年召开的上一次会议标志着邓小平“韬光养晦，争取时间，永不称霸”指导方针的终结，并预示着一个中国开展国际行动的新时代。 在某种程度上这种变化反映了习近平已经完成集权，中国领导人认定美国实力已经相对衰落以及认为中国已成为不可或缺的全球经济参与者的观点。 自2014年以来中国不断扩大巩固其在南中国海的军事存在。 它开创了新丝绸之路的理念，并将其转变为数万亿美元的贸易、投资，基础设施和更广泛的地缘政治/经济倡议，涵盖欧亚大陆，非洲以及其他地区的73个不同国家。 同时中国与大多数发达国家签约建立了第一家大范围非布雷顿森林体系多边开发银行 — — 亚洲基础设施投资银行。 中国还在其邻近东亚的战略利益范围之外实施了一系列外交举措，并积极参与到了2015年伊朗核协定等外交倡议之中。 它在斯里兰卡，巴基斯坦和吉布提开发了海军基地，并远赴地中海和波罗的海一线与俄罗斯共同进行海军演习。 中国还在今年3月成立了自己的国际开发机构。 一个连贯性大战略的浮现（无论西方是否选择承认这一点）还不是自2014年以来所发生变化的全部内容。 首先，对中国共产党所扮演角色的强调力度比以往大大加强。 习近平忧虑中共会在该国重大政策辩论中遭到边缘化，因此重新巩固了党对国家机构的控制，并优先考虑政治意识形态而非技术官僚政策制定。 习近平决心无视西方历史的发展主线，摒弃弗朗西斯·福山（Francis Fukuyama）认定自由民主资本主义获得普遍胜利的“历史的终结”观点，并在长时期内维系一个列宁主义国家。 这个被称之为“习近平思想”的路径如今已经彻底充斥着整个中国外交政策框架。 特别是习近平关于在历史发展方面存在可以辨认且永恒不变的“法则 ” — —而且既可指定又可预测 — — 的观点在上月的外事会议上显得尤为突出。 这听起来像是老一套的辩证唯物主义论调，而且事实也确实如此。 习近平选取马克思列宁主义传统作为自己首选的知识框架。 在这一政治和经济发展铁律之下，辩证唯物主义的世界观意味着世界上的各类事件不存在任何随机性。 因此，习近平认为，如果马克思的分析框架适用于当前时期，那么全球秩序显然处于一个转折点，西方的相对衰落再加上有利的国家和国际环境造就了中国的崛起。 用习近平的话说 ： “ 当前我国处于近代以来最好的发展时期，世界处于百年未有之大变局 。 ” 当然中国的前进道路上依然存在着巨大的障碍，但习近平得出的结论是美国和西方面临的障碍要更大。 这种想法如今将如何推动中国的具体外交政策还是个未知之数。 但至关重要的则是一党制国家 — — 尤其是马克思主义国家 — — 在对现实进行“理想化”的过程中如何抉择：这关乎整个系统是如何跟自身对话的。 而习近平对中国外交政策精英传达的则是极大的信心。 具体而言，本次外事工作会议要求本国的国际政策机构及人员响应习近平的议程。 在此习近平似乎有意针对外交部。 习近平对该部门在政策创新方面的动作迟缓深感不满，并因此传达出一种强烈的意识形态气息。 会议要求中国外交官牢记自己首先是“党的干部 ” ， 暗示习近平可能会推动外交政策机器更大程度地发挥主动性，以充分服务于他本人新构筑的全球视野。 上个月会议产生的最大变化则是在全球治理方面。 在2014年，习近平提到了即将到来的事关未来国际秩序结构的斗争。 虽然他未能继续详细说明，但自那以后，许多工作都致力于三个相互关联的概念：国际秩序；国际体系；全球治理。 当然，这些术语在英语中拥有相互不同又有所重叠的含义。 但广义上来说，在中文中“国际秩序”一词意指（中国所接受的）联合国，布雷顿森林体系机构，G20集团和其他多边机构以及（中国所不接受的）美国全球联盟体系的组合。 “国际体系”一词多指这一国际秩序的前半部分：由根据国际条约法规运作并寻求在共享主权原则的基础上管理全球公共领域的各个多边机构所组成的复杂网络。 “全球治理”表示以此定义的“国际体系”的实际表现。 习近平在外事工作会议上最令人吃惊的新言论则是要求中国“以公平正义为理念引领全球治理体系改革 。 ” 这是迄今为止中国在这一重要问题上对自身意图的最直接表述。 为此全世界都应该坐稳扶好，迎接中国国际政策主动出击的新浪潮。 与国际社会其他大多数国家一样，中国非常清楚当前大部分多边体系的失能状况。 所以习近平领导“全球治理体制改革”的愿望绝非偶然。 它反映了中国将更多地针对多边机构进行外交主动出击，以便将它们重新定位到与中国自身“国家核心利益”更加一致的方向上。 习近平提醒本国的国际政策精英说，中国未来的外交政策方向，包括全球治理改革，必须由这些国家核心利益所驱动。 在这一背景下中国也想要一个更“多极”的国际体系。 它指向的是一个美国和西方权重大幅减少的世界。 而国际社会其他成员所面临的挑战则是确定我们现在想要哪种类型的全球秩序。 欧盟，东南亚国家联盟或非洲联盟等现有机构对未来的国际规则体系有何寄望？ 无论特朗普是否上台，美国到底想要什么？ 我们将如何集体保护《联合国宪章 》 ， 布雷顿森林体系机构以及《世界人权宣言》所体现的全球价值观？ 全球秩序的未来处于不稳定状态。 而中国构思出了一个清晰的未来蓝图。 同时也是时候让国际社会的其他成员发展出属于自己的那一套了。 本文是根据作者在新加坡国立大学李光耀公共政策学院所发表的演讲整理而成。"

            "Xi of Arabia BEIJING – Those who have criticized China’s cautious foreign policy need to reconsider their position, following President Xi Jinping’s just-completed visit to Saudi Arabia and Iran – two major Middle Eastern powers that are currently at each other’s throats. The visits reflect the more active foreign-policy approach that Xi has spearheaded, particularly in the Middle East. This new approach raises an important question: Can China’s impact on the region be more constructive than that of the United States? Now is certainly a tense time to become involved in the Middle East, a region where, as Richard N. Haass argues, a New Thirty Years’ War, in which “civil wars and proxy wars become impossible to distinguish,” is unfolding. A key factor in unleashing the current chaos – which represents the convergence of numerous deep-rooted challenges and conflicts – was America’s 2003 invasion of Iraq. By eliminating Saddam Hussein’s Sunni regime, the US paved the way for a Shia-led government, a development that tilted the regional balance of power toward Iran and left Sunni-ruled Saudi Arabia feeling encircled by a Shia coalition. That is why Iran and Saudi Arabia are so deeply involved in Syria’s civil war. They know that the fate of President Bashar al-Assad’s Alawite regime will have significant implications for the regional order. For Saudi Arabia, reining in Iran is all the more important in the wake of the recent agreement on the country’s nuclear program, which has resulted in the lifting of international economic sanctions that have long constrained Iran’s regional leadership ambitions. Of course, neither Saudi Arabia nor Iran – or Turkey, which has also joined the competition for regional influence – is seeking a direct confrontation. These countries would rather empower other actors, even if it means fueling dangerous religious radicalization and the privatization of violence. The terrorist movements that have emerged as a result of this approach – namely, the Islamic State – cannot be defeated using traditional counter-terrorism operations. To be sure, these Middle East rivals are not the only ones involved in the region’s current quagmire. External powers like France, Russia, and, of course, the US are also deeply involved, each with its own geopolitical objectives. Now China is entering the fray, bringing a uniquely constructive vision with it. The two characters that comprise the Chinese word for crisis (危机) mean, individually, “danger” (危) and “opportunity” (机). That is precisely what China sees in today’s Middle East. For most of the relevant actors, highly perilous geopolitical competition is overshadowing vast economic opportunities. Not for China. As Xi put it on his recent visit to Cairo: “Instead of looking for a proxy in the Middle East, we promote peace talks; instead of seeking any sphere of influence, we call on all parties to join the circle of friends for the Belt and Road initiative.” This reflects the broader foreign-policy rebalancing that Xi has been pursuing since taking office in 2013. Unlike the US, which has been engineering a strategic “pivot” from one geographic region to another, China is rebalancing from “politics among nations” to “politics among networks,” focusing on “connectivity” rather than “control.” The Middle East is crucial to this connectivity-oriented grand strategy, not least because of its key role in the “One Belt, One Road” project that Xi promoted in Cairo. China’s determination to reestablish the ancient Silk Roads – including the overland route that runs through the Middle East – has led it to enter into strategic partnerships with eight Arab countries in recent years, and to sign agreements with six Arab countries to pursue the initiative jointly. Iran, Turkey, and seven Arab countries are among the founding members of the Beijing-based Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, a key institution for financing related infrastructure projects. But China is not waiting for the One Belt, One Road initiative to be completed before pursuing increased trade with Middle Eastern countries. During his recent visit to Saudi Arabia, he claimed that free-trade negotiations between the Gulf Cooperation Council and China should be concluded this year. Moreover, Xi announced that China will issue $55 billion in loans to the Middle East, including a $15 billion special loan for industrialization, $10 billion in commercial loans to boost production capacity, and $10 billion in concessional loans. The remaining $20 billion will go toward a joint investment fund with the United Arab Emirates and Qatar to invest in traditional energy, infrastructure development, and high-end manufacturing industries in the region. All of this aligns with the “1+2+3” cooperation pattern that Xi proposed at the June 2014 Ministerial Conference of the China-Arab States Cooperation Forum in Beijing. According to this approach, energy cooperation should form the core of collaboration, while infrastructure construction and trade and investment form two wings. Nuclear power, satellites, and new energy sources are three high-tech areas where cooperation can lead to important breakthroughs. Here, the goal is to take advantage of the region’s energy resources, while helping it to industrialize and diversify its economy. Of course, China’s success in the Middle East requires progress on mitigating the region’s tensions, cooling its hotspots, and stabilizing weak countries – all of which will require smart diplomacy by many actors. But peace and development are inextricably linked. To turn the tide against extremism, Middle Eastern countries must be able to provide economic opportunities to their people, and these can only be secured through trade, investment, and jobs. In this fundamental respect, China has a lot to offer the Middle East – and President Xi has once again shown his determination to offer it.",
            "阿拉伯的习主席 北京—那些批评中国外交政策谨小慎微的人需要重新考虑立场了。 中国国家主席习近平刚刚结束了对沙特阿拉伯和伊朗的访问。 这两个国家都是中东主要力量，目前处于严重对峙状态。 此次出访体现了习近平所主导的更加积极的外交政策方针，特别是在中东。 这一新方针引出了一个重要问题：中国在该地区的影响力是否比美国更具建设性？ 如今显然是介入中东的敏感时刻，理查德·哈斯（Richard N. Haass）认为，该地区正在展开一场新三十年战争 ， “ 内战和代理战争已无法区分 ” 。 导致当前乱象 — — 其根源是众多深层次挑战和冲突汇聚在一起 — — 的一大关键因素是2003年美国入侵伊拉克。 美国推翻了萨达姆·侯赛因的逊尼派政权，为什叶派领导的政府扫清了道路，这一变化让地区平衡向伊朗倾斜，也让逊尼派统治的沙特阿拉伯感到被什叶派联盟所包围。 因此，伊朗和沙特阿拉伯都深深介入了叙利亚内战。 它们知道，叙利亚总统巴沙尔·阿萨德的阿拉维派政权的命运对于地区秩序具有重大影响。 对沙特阿拉伯来说，在最近伊核问题达成协议（长期限制伊朗作为地区领导者雄心的国际经济制裁将因此取消）的情况下，制约伊朗是其第一要务。 当然，沙特阿拉伯和伊朗 — — 还有土耳其，它刚刚加入到争夺地区影响力的竞争中 — — 都不想要直接冲突。 这些国家宁可扶持其他行动方，即使这意味着会增强危险的宗教激进化和暴力私有化。 因地区国家的这一方略而崛起的恐怖主义运动（即伊斯兰国）是无法用传统反恐行动打败的。 平心而论，这些中东对峙各方并不是该地区当前乱局的唯一当事方。 外部力量，如法国、俄罗斯，当然还有美国，也深深地介入其中，每一方都有其自身的地缘政治目标。 现在中国也在加入其中，带来了独一无二的建设性政策。 中文词语“危机”包含着“危”和“机”两个汉字。 这正是当前中国对中东的看法。 对最相关的行动方而言，高度危险的地缘政治竞争使巨大的经济机会黯然失色。 对中国来说并非如此。 习近平最近在访问开罗时指出 ， “ 我们在中东不找代理人，而是劝和促谈；不搞势力范围，而是推动大家一起加入‘一带一路’朋友圈 。 ” 这反映出习近平自2013年执政以来一直在推动的更大层面上的外交政策再平衡。 与一直在将战略“支点”从一个地区转向另一个地区的美国不同，中国正在实施从“国家间政治”向“网络间政治”的再平衡，着重于“连通”而非“控制 ” 。 对于这种以连通为导向的大战略来说，中东地区至关重要，它是习近平此行在开罗所宣扬的“一带一路”计划的关键。 中国决心重建古丝绸之路 — — 包括横穿中东的陆上丝绸之路 — — 因此近几年来中国与八个阿拉伯国家建立了战略伙伴关系，并与六个阿拉伯国家签署协议共同推进“一带一路 ” 。 伊朗、土耳其和七个阿拉伯国家是亚洲基础设施投资银行的创始成员国，该银行总部设在北京，它是相关基础设施项目的关键融资机构。 但中国并没有等到“一带一路”计划完成后再去增加与中东国家的贸易。 在最近访问沙特阿拉伯期间，习近平宣布，海湾合作委员会与中国的自由贸易谈判要在今年完成。 此外，习近平还宣布中国将向中东提供550亿美元贷款，包括150亿美元工业化特别贷款、100亿美元用于增进产能的商业贷款和100亿美元优惠贷款。 其他200亿美元将以与阿联酋和卡塔尔组成联合投资基金的形式，投资于该地区的传统能源、基础设施开发和高端制造业。 所有这些都与习近平在2014年6月的中阿国家合作论坛部长级会议上所提出的“1+2+3”合作模式相符。 根据这一方针，能源合作将成为一个核心，而基础设施建设与贸易投资组成两翼，核能、卫星和新能源是合作中可能形成重大突破的三大高科技领域。 这一合作模式的目标是利用好中东国家的能源资源，同时帮助它们实现工业化和经济多元化。 当然，中国在中东的成功需要在减少该地区紧张局势、给热点降温、稳定较弱国家等方面取得进展 — — 所有这些都需要众多行动方的明智外交政策。 但和平与发展是密不可分的。 要想扭转极端主义趋势，中东国家必须能够为民众提供经济机会，而经济机会只能通过贸易、投资和就业来实现。 在这一关键方面，中国能够给中东提供很多帮助 — — 而习近平主席也再次表达了提供帮助的决心。"

            "China’s Coming Clash with Economic Reality LONDON – Judging by the reporting from the Communist Party of China’s 20th National Congress, Xi Jinping, newly anointed to an unprecedented third term as president, is tightening his political grip and strengthening the CPC’s control over society. Can successful economic development continue in this environment? I have been thinking for many months now that one day, I would wake up to read that China was revisiting its zero-COVID strategy, overhauling the CPC’s interaction with domestic private business, truly reforming the country’s hukou system of residence permits, and rethinking crucial aspects of its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and its recent tactical stance on international governance. It is proving to be a very long wait. At a meeting with a senior Chinese official a few months ago, I jokingly said that my 30-plus years of “understanding” China may have been a fluke, because I couldn’t comprehend some policies the country had adopted in recent years. The only way I could rationalize them was to conclude that they must be part of some tactical maneuver to neutralize factions within the CPC’s upper echelons ahead of the Congress. Judging by who the Congress has chosen to be next to Xi in the new leadership, there have certainly been further purges of opponents – and very few signs of a reversal of the policies of recent years. Unless the post-Congress days and weeks produce a big surprise, I see growing dilemmas emerging for Xi and the CPC. In the BRICs analysis (the purported rise of Brazil, Russia, India, and China) that my then-colleagues and I produced a generation ago, the decade 2021-30 was supposed to be when China’s economy closed in on the US in nominal terms. This was why the BRICs economies collectively might go on in the next decade to become larger than the G7, which would of course represent an enormous change to the modern world order. This assumed that countries would achieve their long-term potential productivity rate, because Chinese GDP growth would decelerate as its labor-force growth peaked, implying that most of the 4.5-5% GDP growth we had assumed would reflect productivity gains. This growth rate is consistent with what China has stated is both required and desired to double its GDP per capita by 2035 from the 2020 level. But the last three years suggest that China is unlikely to achieve this target unless it reconsiders its current policies. Virtually all scientific evidence suggests that it is impossible to eradicate COVID-19. The only plausible way to manage it is with proven vaccines. Chinese leaders’ fear that abandoning the zero-COVID policy would overrun the health system and cause mortality to rise is understandable, but the policy is entirely inconsistent with the path to the 2035 goal. It has been clear for some time that China can achieve its goal only if Chinese consumers become a central part of the country’s growth model. Rolling lockdowns make this virtually impossible. Surely the time has come to import the best Western vaccines and change course. Among other benefits, such a step would send a powerful signal to the rest of the world that China wants to open again. In such a scenario, there could even be a reversal of the ongoing economic decoupling between China and Western countries, as well as of the growing difficulties surrounding most global governance bodies, such as the G20, the World Health Organization, the International Monetary Fund, and the World Bank. COVID-19 is hardly the only policy area in need of rapid reform. In particular, the authorities must address the growing signs of a vicious circular weakening of the housing market and construction, as well as the lack of success of Xi’s signature BRI. I hope these words will be read as constructive criticism from someone who saw China’s potential over 30 years ago and imagined a world where it could become the biggest economy. Back then, I thought this would benefit not only China, especially its citizens, but also the rest of us. This month, the US National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) published a study, “The Future of Global Economic Power,” looking all the way to 2100. It follows an analytical framework very similar to that of our BRICs analysis, and its main scenario still concludes that China will become the world’s largest economy by the end of the century, with another BRIC country, India, in second place. But there are two other scenarios with less favorable paths of productivity growth. In one of them, India, not China, is the world’s largest economy by 2100. And in the second, productivity falls short of the path of the past three decades, as it has in recent years, and China’s share of global GDP declines notably. One can only hope that whoever Xi surrounds himself with in the coming years takes the NBER report to heart.",
            "中国即将遭遇的经济现实 发自伦敦 — — 从中国共产党第二十次全国代表大会的相关报道来看，刚刚破天荒三度加冕国家主席的习近平正在收紧其政治掌控并加强中共对社会的控制。 那么在这种环境下还能否继续实现成功的经济发展呢？ 好几个月来我一直在想，也许有天一觉醒来会发现中国正在重新审视其新冠清零战略，彻底改变党与国内私营企业的互动方式，真正改革“户口”这一居住证制度，并重新思考其“一带一路 ”倡议的某些关键方面以及最近在国际治理方面的策略立场。 但事实证明这将是一个非常漫长的等待。 在几个月前与一位中国高级官员的会面中，我开玩笑地说自己30多年来对中国的“了解”或许只是某种巧合，因为我无法理解这个国家近年所采取的一些政策。 我唯一能将其合理化的方法是将其视为一场战术演练的一部分，目的是在二十大召开之前消灭中共高层内部的各类派别。 从大会选出辅佐习近平的新领导人选来看，肯定还会有对反对派的进一步清洗 — — 而且几乎没有什么迹象表明近几年出台的那些政策会被撤回。 除非在二十大闭幕后的那十来天内出现重大变故，否则我认为习近平和中国共产党所面临的困境只会日益严峻。 在我和当时的同僚们在一代人之前所做的金砖四国分析报告（所谓巴西、俄罗斯、印度和中国的崛起）中，2021~2030年应该是中国经济在名义上逼近美国的时候。 这就是当时判断“金砖四国”经济总量可能在未来十年内超过七国集团的原因，当然也意味着现代世界秩序的巨大变化。 此处假设各国都能实现其长期潜在生产率，因为中国的GDP增长将随其劳动力增长达到顶峰而减速，意味着我们假设的4.5~5%GDP增长中的大部分将来自于生产率的提升。 而这一增长率也与中国声明要将2035年的人均GDP在2020年基础上翻一番的要求和愿望是一致的。 但过去三年的状况表明除非中国重新考虑其现行政策，否则不太可能实现这一目标。 几乎所有科学证据都表明新冠病毒无法被根除，而应对它的唯一合理方式就是使用经过检验的疫苗。 中国领导人担心放弃新冠清零政策会使医疗卫生系统不堪重负，导致民众死亡率上升，这可以理解，可是该政策与实现2035年目标的路径完全背道而驰。 人们早就清楚认识到只有让中国消费者成为国家增长模式的核心才能实现其目标。 而滚动式封控措施却使这一点变得近乎不可能。 现在是进口最高品质西方疫苗并改变政策路线的时候了。 除了其他好处外，这么一个举措将向世界其他国家发出一个强有力的信号 — — 中国希望再次开放。 在这种情况下中国和西方国家之间正在进行的经济脱钩，以及围绕20国集团、世界卫生组织、国际货币基金组织和世界银行等大多数全球治理机构的艰难局面都可能发生逆转。 新冠病毒并不是唯一亟待改革的政策领域。 当局还必须重点解决日益削弱住房市场和建筑业的恶性循环迹象，以及一带一路倡议这个习近平招牌政策的不成功局面。 我希望上述文字能被看作是一个人的建设性批评：这个人在30多年前就看到了中国的潜力，想象着一个中国可能成为最大经济体的世界。 当时我认为这不仅有利于中国（特别是其民众 ） ， 也有利于我们其他所有人。 美国国家经济研究局于本月发表了一项名为《全球经济势力的未来 》 、 一直展望到2100年的研究报告。 它采用的分析框架与我们的“金砖四国”分析非常相似，其主要情境仍判定中国将在本世纪末成为全球最大经济体，另一个金砖国家印度则位居次席。 但还有另外两种生产力增长路径不太有利的情境：其中一种情境下印度 — — 而不是中国 — — 将2100年成为全球最大经济体，而另一种情境下的生产力就像最近几年这样未能达到过去三十年的水平，致使中国在全球GDP中的份额明显下降。 我们只能寄望无论习近平在未来几年间选择了哪个领导班子，他都能将美国国家经济研究局的报告记在心上。"

            "China’s Contradictions NEW HAVEN – China’s quinquennial Communist Party congresses are that rare event where ritual and dogma combine with introspection and strategy. The 19th National Congress, which began on October 18, is no exception. Notwithstanding the suspense over potential changes in Party leadership, which typically occur at the end of the meeting, President Xi Jinping’s political report, delivered on the opening day, was a high-impact event. Significantly, it says as much about the Party as it does about Xi. As Alice Miller, a leading Sinologist at Stanford’s Hoover Institution, emphasizes, the report was carefully crafted over a one-year period to convey the consensus of the Party’s highest organ, the 205-member Central Committee. Three conclusions from Xi’s address are particularly important. For starters, the ideological underpinnings of “Xi Jinping Thought” have been raised to the same lofty level as those of “Mao Zedong Thought,” effectively elevating Xi over his three predecessors – Hu Jintao, Jiang Zemin, and even the revered Deng Xiaoping. Much has been written about Xi’s consolidation of power since he was appointed General Secretary in November 2012. But this elevation makes it official. After only five years in office, the Party leadership has anointed Xi as one of modern China’s two greatest historic figures. Second, the political report speaks with great confidence about a China that has now entered a “New Era.” But by underscoring the Chinese adage that the “…last leg of a journey just marks the halfway point,” Xi sketched an even more ambitious future. China’s sights are now set on two goals – completing the task of building the so-called moderately prosperous society by 2035, and then establishing its position as a Great Power by 2050. Unlike China’s goal-setting exercises in the past, there are no quantitative targets attached to these “twin centenary goals” (which roughly align with the Party’s founding in 1921 and the establishment of the People’s Republic of China in 1949). They celebrate the long-awaited national rejuvenation that Xi has dubbed the China Dream. The third point is perhaps the most intriguing. This is couched in the form of China’s “principal contradiction” – a Marxist concept that serves as an admission of a fundamental problem requiring resolution. The principal contradiction, while typically elliptical and ambiguous, frames a rich discussion of risks and opportunities, strategy and tactics, reforms and governance – all of which will shape China’s prospects for the foreseeable future. The big news is that, under Xi’s leadership, the Party has revised its principal contradiction for the first time since 1981. Whereas the contradiction had previously been framed as a tradeoff between the needs of the people and China’s “backward social production,” it is now viewed as a tension between “unbalanced and inadequate development” and the “people’s ever-growing needs for a better life.” This restatement of the principal contradiction has not emerged from thin air. It clearly signals a far-reaching change in national perspective – from that of a poor developing country to that of an increasingly prosperous society focused on becoming a Great Power. It is also consistent with the critique of former Premier Wen Jiabao, who in March 2007 famously warned of a Chinese economy that was becoming increasingly “unstable, unbalanced, uncoordinated, and [ultimately] unsustainable.” Over the past ten years, two five-year plans – the 12th, enacted in 2011, and the 13th, enacted in 2016 – plus a major set of reforms adopted at the so-called Third Plenum in 2013, have aimed to resolve China’s persistent and worrisome imbalances. Xi’s political report doesn’t alter the main thrust of those efforts. The real significance is that rebalancing is now enshrined within the Party’s ideological underpinnings. It is a foundational pillar of Xi Jinping Thought. The political report’s focus on China’s principal contradiction also raises important questions about what still may be missing from the Party’s long-term strategy. Three “secondary contradictions” are especially striking on the economic front. First, there is ongoing tension between the role of the state and that of markets in guiding resource allocation. This was a glaring contradiction of the 2013 Third Plenum reforms, which focused on the seemingly inconsistent combination of a “decisive role” for markets and steadfast support for state ownership. The Party has long believed that these two features of economic life are compatible – the so-called blended economy with Chinese characteristics. Xi’s political report praises the mixed ownership model and also aspires to an economy led by great firms with unmatched global competitive prowess. But it glosses over the thorny issue of state-owned enterprise reform that may be required to resolve this contradiction and avoid the Japanese “zombie” problem of a chronic debt overhang. Second, there is the tension between supply and demand. Consistent with other recent pronouncements of senior Chinese officials, the political report leaves little doubt that supply-side structural reforms are now the highest priority of economic policymakers. The related emphasis on productivity, innovation, pruning excess capacity, and moving up the value chain in manufacturing and services are underscored as key building blocks of this effort. At the same time, the report de-emphasizes consumer spending and services – now buried deep in the list of priorities for a modernized economy. Yet focusing on supply without paying equal attention to the foundations of aggregate demand is a puzzling and potentially worrisome disconnect. A final secondary tension can be found in the contrast between the path and the destination. Notwithstanding all the self-congratulatory flourishes in Xi’s political report, there is good reason to believe that the Chinese economy is only in the early stages of its long-heralded structural transformation. Its services sector is growing rapidly, but is still embryonic, accounting for just 52% of GDP. And household consumption, which is also growing rapidly, is still less than 40% of GDP. China may well be on a path to a New Normal or a New Era. But the final destination remains far down the road, with many contradictions to be resolved during the journey.",
            "中国的各类矛盾 发自纽黑文 — — 五年一度的中共全国代表大会是一场罕见地将仪式、教条和内省、战略相结合的事件，而10月18日召开的十九大也不例外。 尽管悬念总是被放在会议末段的中共高层领导班子调整上，但习近平总书记在开幕当天的政治报告也是一个具备高度影响力的事件。 值得注意的是，报告用了跟谈论习近平一样的篇幅来谈论党。 正如斯坦福大学胡佛研究所的知名中国研究家爱丽丝·米勒（Alice Miller）所强调的那样，这份精心攥写了一年的报告就是用来传达由205人组成的中共中央委员会（也是中共最高领导机关）的共识。 习近平的三个结论尤为重要。 首先 ， “ 习近平思想”已经被提升到与“毛泽东思想”相同的崇高水平，实际上超越了他的三位前任：胡锦涛，江泽民，甚至是威望极高的邓小平。 我们已经看过有很多关于习近平自从2012年11月被任命为党总书记以来如何巩固权力的文章报道，但这一提升使其被正式确定下来。 仅仅在位五年时间，党的领导层就已经将习近平拔高成了现代中国的两大历史人物之一。 第二，这份政治报告以充满信心的语气谈论了现在进入“新时代”的中国，但通过强调“行百里者半九十”这句格言，习近平描绘了一个更加雄心勃勃的未来。 中国的目光现在放在两个目标上 — — 到2035年完成建设所谓小康社会的任务（报告原文为“在全面建成小康社会的基础上，再奋斗十五年，基本实现社会主义现代化 ” ） ，然后在2050年前建成一个强国。 跟中国过去的目标制定做法不同，这两个“百年奋斗目标 ” （ 与1921年中共建党和1949年中华人民共和国成立时间大致配对）并没有提出任何量化指标，只是颂扬了期待已久的民族复兴（习近平称之为“中国梦 ” ） 。 第三点可能是最有趣的。 这体现在关于中国“主要矛盾”形式的措辞上 — — 这是一个用以提出亟待解决之根本问题的马克思主义概念。 这一主要矛盾的表述虽然通常是隐晦且模凌两可的，但却会构成对关于风险/机遇、战略/手段和改革/治理的丰富讨论，所有这些都将在可预见的未来塑造中国的前景。 最重要的是，在习近平的领导下中共自1981年以来首次修改了对主要矛盾的描述，该矛盾从前被认为是人民日益增长的物质文化需求和“落后生产力”之间的折衷，如今被修改为“不平衡不充分的发展”和“人民日益增长的美好生活需要”之间的紧张关系。 这个主要矛盾的重述并不是空穴来风。 其清楚地展现了关于中国国家视野的一个重大变化 — — 从贫穷的发展中国家再到一个旨在成为强国的逐渐富裕社会。 这也跟前总理温家宝的评论是一致的，他在2007年3月曾经警告说，中国经济越来越“不稳定，不平衡，不协调，并（最终）不可持续 ” 。 在过去十年来出台的两个五年计划（2011年颁布的十二五和2016年颁布的十三五 ） ， 加上2013年召开的十八届三中全会所通过的一系列改革，都旨在解决中国持续存在且令人忧虑的失衡问题。 习近平的政治报告并未改变这一系列努力的主旨。 真正重大的意义在于再平衡现在已经被纳入了党的思想基础之内，也是习近平思想的基础支柱。 政治报告对中国主要矛盾的关注也引发了关与党的长期战略中仍然缺失哪些内容的重大问题。 而对此三个“次要矛盾”在经济方面尤为突出。 首先，国家与市场在指导资源配置方面所扮演的角色依然存在冲突。 在2013年十八届三中全会改革中曾提到过一个明显矛盾，重点在于市场的“决定性作用”和对国家所有权的坚定支持这两者看似不协调的组合。 长期以来，党始终认为经济生活的这两大特征是可以兼容的 — — 也就是所谓中国特色的混合所有制经济。 习近平的政治报告赞扬了这一混合所有制模式，也渴望建立一个以具备压倒性全球竞争实力的伟大企业为主导的经济，但报告掩盖了解决这一矛盾以及避免日本式“僵尸企业”长期欠债问题所需的棘手国企改革。 二是供需矛盾紧张。 与最近中国高层官员的其他声明一致，政治报告认为供应方面的结构改革无疑是经济决策者当前的首要任务。 对提高生产率，创新，削减过剩产能以及向制造业和服务价值链上游迈进的相关强调也是这一努力的重要组成部分。 与此同时，该报告放弃了对消费者支出和服务的强调 — — 这项事务如今已经在建设现代化经济的优先事项中排名末尾了。 然而，关注供应却不重视那些构建总需求的基础是一个令人困惑且有可能在将来引发担忧的缺失。 最后一个次要矛盾可以在路径和目的地之间的对比中找到。 尽管习近平的政治报告充斥着自我表扬，但有理由相信中国经济依然处于其长期鼓吹的结构转型的早期阶段。 其服务业正在快速增长，但仍处于初创阶段，仅占GDP的52 ％ 。 家庭消费虽然也在快速增长，也还不不足GDP的40 ％ 。 中国或许已经走上了一个迈向新常态或新时代的道路。 但最终目的地依然遥远，旅途中也会有许多矛盾需要解决。"

            "Xi’s Historic Mistake BERKELEY – Late last month, the American actor John Cena issued a groveling public apology after having referred to Taiwan as a “country” in an interview to promote his latest film. Though he was using the term to refer to a linguistic media market with a discrete distribution channel, not to the status of the island of Taiwan in international law, the Chinese government would make no allowance for such distinctions. What are we to make of this episode? Clearly, globalization has gone terribly wrong. The speech restrictions dictated by China’s authoritarian government apply not just to China but also, and increasingly, to the outside world. Even in my own day-to-day experience, I have noticed that far too many people now speak elliptically, elusively, and euphemistically about contemporary China. I could do that, too. I could subtly point out that no empire has ever had more than five good emperors in a row, and that it is important for a society to preserve a place for well-meaning critics like the sixteenth-century Chinese official Hai Rui, the early communist-era military leader Peng Dehuai, and the economic reformer Deng Xiaoping. But I prefer to speak frankly and directly about the real issues that lie behind terminological disputes over Taiwan. In my view, it is in China’s own interest that the government in Taipei remains the sole authority on the island, so that it can continue to follow an institutional and governance path that is different from that of the People’s Republic. Likewise, it is in China’s interest that Hong Kong remains a second system. The government in Beijing ought to recognize that substantial regional autonomy, especially for areas with non-Han-majority populations, will serve its own long-term ambitions. The appalling and tragic history of genocide, ethnic cleansing, and forced assimilation in the twentieth century suggests that top-down, imperial Sinicization will sow resentments that will last generations and create conditions for serious trouble in the coming years and decades. Humanity has grown up enough to know that diversity, regional autonomy, and cosmopolitanism are better than the alternatives. A regime that aspires to lead the world toward a brighter future should be especially cognizant of this. Nonetheless, China’s current paramount leader, Xi Jinping, very much wishes to centralize authority in Beijing. Rightly fearing careerism and corruption in the Communist Party of China, he seeks not a Cultural Revolution but a Cultural Renaissance to restore egalitarian values and utopian aspirations across the leadership ranks. Supremely confident in his ability to read the situation and issue the right commands, his main concern is that his orders won’t be implemented properly. The solution to that problem, he seems to have concluded, is much greater concentration of power. But even if Xi has made the right tactical calculation for the current moment, his own senescence, together with the logic of how authoritarian command organizations evolve, all but ensure that his strategy will end in tears. It is a huge mistake to ignore the benefits that come with more regional autonomy. Consider an alternative history in which the People’s Liberation Army had overrun both Hong Kong and Taiwan in 1949; Sichuan had not been allowed to pursue pilot reform programs in 1975, when Zhao Ziyang was appointed provincial party secretary; and China’s centralization had proceeded to the point that the Guangzhou Military District could not offer Deng refuge from the wrath of the Gang of Four in 1976. What would China’s economy look like today? It would be a basket case. Rather than enjoying a rapid ascent to economic superpower status, China would find itself being compared to the likes of Burma or Pakistan. When Mao Zedong died in 1976, China was impoverished and rudderless. But it learned to stand on its own two feet by drawing on Taiwan and Hong Kong’s entrepreneurial classes and financing systems, emulating Zhao’s policies in Sichuan, and opening up Special Economic Zones in places like Guangzhou and Shenzhen. At some point in the future, China will need to choose between governmental strategies and systems. It is safe to assume that relying on top-down decrees from an aging, mentally declining paramount leader who is vulnerable to careerist flattery will not produce good results. The more that China centralizes, the more it will suffer. But if decisions about policies and institutions are based on a rough consensus among keen-eyed observers who are open to emulating the practices and experiments of successful regions, China will thrive. A China with many distinct systems exploring possible paths to the future might really have a chance of becoming a global leader and proving worthy of the role. A centralized, authoritarian China that demands submission to a single emperor will never have that opportunity.",
            "习大大的历史错误 伯克利-上个月末，美国演员约翰•塞纳（JohnCena）在为宣传新片接受采访时将台湾称为\"国家 \" ， 随后他发表了卑躬屈膝的公开道歉。 虽然他用这个“台湾”一词指的是一个拥有独立分销渠道的语言媒体市场，而不是台湾岛在国际法中的地位，但中国政府不会对这种区别做出任何让步。 我们怎么看待此事？ 显然，全球化已经大错特错了。 中国专制政府规定的用词限制不仅适用于中国，也日益适用于外部世界。 即使在我自己的日常经历中，我也注意到，现在有太多人对于当代中国的言论都是暧昧、隐晦、委婉的。 我也能做到这样。 我可以微言大义地说，没有一个帝国曾经连续拥有过五位以上的好皇帝，对于为十六世纪的海瑞、共产主义早期军事领袖彭德怀和经济改革家邓小平这样善意的批评者保留一席之地的社会来说，这一点很重要。 但我更喜欢坦率和直接地谈论台湾术语争端背后的真正问题。 我认为，台北政府仍然是岛内唯一的权威，从而它可以继续走一条与中华人民共和国不同的体制和治理道路，这样符合中国自身的利益。 同样，香港保留“两制”也这符合中国的利益。 北京政府应该认识到，实质性的区域自治，特别是在非汉族占多数的地区，有利于其自身的长期雄心。 二十世纪骇人听闻的种族灭绝、种族清洗和强迫同化的悲惨历史表明，自上而下的帝国主义中国化将播下怨恨，持续几代人，并为今后几年和几十年的丧乱创造条件。 人类已经足够成熟，明白多样性、区域自治和世界主义比其他选择更好。 一个渴望带领世界走向更光明的未来的政权应该特别认识到这一点。 尽管如此，中国现任最高领导人习近平非常渴望集中中国的权力。 他正确地担心中国共产党的追名逐利和腐败，他追求文化复兴，而不是文化大革命，来恢复整个领导层的平等价值观和乌托邦式愿望。 他对自己了解情况和发出正确命令的能力非常有信心，他主要担心的是他的命令无法得到正确执行。 他好像总结过，解决这个问题的办法就是大大集中权力。 但是，即使习近平目前做出了正确的战术计算，自身的衰老，加上威权指挥组织的逻辑的演化，可以肯定他的战略将以眼泪告终。 忽视增加区域自治权带来的好处是一个巨大的错误。 试想一下，1949年中国人民解放军在攻下香港和台湾会怎样；1975年赵紫阳被任命为省委书记时四川没有获准进行改革试点会怎样；1976年中国权力的集中化达到了广州军区不能为邓小平提供避难，躲避四人帮的愤怒的底部会怎样。 如果这样，今天的中国经济将是一副什么模样？ 这将是一场经济灾难。 中国将无法迅速崛起为经济超级大国，二十沦为缅甸和巴基斯坦之流。 1976年毛泽东逝世时，中国百废待兴，群龙无首。 但它学会了依靠台湾和香港的创业阶层和融资体系，模仿赵紫阳在四川的政策，在广州和深圳等地开放经济特区，从而实现自立。 在未来某个时候，中国需要在政府战略和制度之间做出选择。 可以放心地假设，依靠一个年迈、精力不济、容易受野心家奉承而被左右的至高无上领导人的自上而下的法令，不会产生好的结果。 中国越是集权，遭受的痛苦就越大。 但是，如果有关政策和制度的决定是基于敏锐的观察家们的粗略共识 — — 他们愿意效仿成功地区的做法和实验 — — 那么中国将会兴旺发达。 一个拥有众多不同制度、探索未来可能道路的中国，可能真的有机会成为全球领导者，并证明自己配得上这一角色。 一个要求屈服于一个皇帝的集权专制的中国永则远不会有这个机会。"

            "China’s Himalayan Salami Tactics NEW DELHI – Emboldened by its cost-free expansion in the South China Sea, Chinese President Xi Jinping’s regime has stepped up efforts to replicate that model in the Himalayas. In particular, China is aggressively building many new villages in disputed borderlands to extend or consolidate its control over strategically important areas that India, Bhutan, and Nepal maintain fall within their national boundaries. Underscoring the strategic implications of China’s drive to populate these desolate, uninhabited border areas is its major buildup of new military facilities there. The new installations range from electronic warfare stations and air defense sites to underground ammunition depots. China’s militarized village-building spree has renewed the regional spotlight on Xi’s expansionist strategy at a time when, despite a recent disengagement in one area, tens of thousands of its troops remain locked in multiple standoffs with Indian forces. Recurrent skirmishing began last May after India discovered to its alarm that Chinese forces had stealthily occupied mountaintops and other strategic vantage points in its northernmost Ladakh borderlands. China’s newly built border villages in the Himalayas are the equivalent of its artificially created islands in the South China Sea, whose geopolitical map Xi’s regime has redrawn without firing a shot. Xi’s regime advanced its South China Sea expansionism through asymmetrical or hybrid warfare, waged below the threshold of overt armed conflict. This approach blends conventional and irregular tactics with small incremental territorial encroachments (or “salami slicing”), psychological manipulation, disinformation, lawfare, and coercive diplomacy. Now China is applying that playbook in the Himalayan borderlands. The Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post, citing a Chinese government document, recently reported that China intends to build 624 border villages in disputed Himalayan areas. In the name of “poverty alleviation,” the Communist Party of China is callously uprooting Tibetan nomads and forcing them to settle in artificial new border villages in isolated, high-altitude areas. The CPC has also sent ethnic Han Chinese party members to such villages to serve as resident overseers. Creating a dispute where none previously existed is usually China’s first step toward asserting a territorial claim, before it furtively tries to seize the coveted area. Xi’s regime frequently uses civilian militias in the vanguard of such a strategy. So, just as China has employed flotillas of coastguard-backed civilian fishing boats for expansionist forays in the South and East China Seas, it has been sending herders and grazers ahead of regular army troops into desolate Himalayan border areas to foment disputes and then assert control. Such an approach has enabled it to nibble away at Himalayan territories, one pasture at a time. In international law, a territorial claim must be based on continuous and peaceful exercise of sovereignty over the territory concerned. Until now, China’s Himalayan claims have been anchored in a “might makes right” approach that seeks to extend its annexation of Tibet to neighboring countries’ borderlands. By building new border villages and relocating people there, China can now invoke international law in support of its claims. Effective control is the sine qua non of a strong territorial claim in international law. Armed patrols don’t prove effective control, but settlements do. The speed and stealth with which China has been changing the facts on the ground in the Himalayas, with little regard for the geopolitical fallout, also reflects other considerations. Border villages, for example, will constrain the opposing military’s use of force while aiding Chinese intelligence gathering and cross-frontier operations. Satellite images show how rapidly such villages have sprouted up, along with extensive new roads and military facilities. The Chinese government recently justified constructing a new village inside the sprawling Indian border state of Arunachal Pradesh by saying it “never recognized” Indian sovereignty over that region. And China’s territorial encroachments have not spared one of the world’s smallest countries, Bhutan, or even Nepal, which has a pro-China communist government. China conceived its border-village program after Xi called on Tibetan herdsmen in 2017 to settle in frontier areas and “become guardians of Chinese territory.” Xi said in his appeal that, “without peace in the territory, there will be no peaceful lives for millions of families.” But Xi’s “poverty alleviation” program in Tibet, which has steadily gained momentum since 2019, has centered on cynically relocating the poor to neighboring countries’ territories. The echoes of China’s maritime expansionism extend to the Himalayan environment. Xi’s island building in the South China Sea has “caused severe harm to the coral reef environment,” according to an international arbitral tribunal. Likewise, China’s construction of villages and military facilities in the borderlands threatens to wreak havoc on the ecologically fragile Himalayas, which are the source of Asia’s great rivers. Environmental damage is already apparent on the once-pristine Doklam Plateau, claimed by Bhutan, which China has transformed into a heavily militarized zone since seizing it in 2017. Indian army chief Manoj Naravane recently claimed that China’s salami tactics “will not work.” Yet even an important military power like India is struggling to find effective ways to counter China’s territorial aggrandizement along one of the world’s most inhospitable and treacherous borders. China’s bulletless aggression – based on using military-backed civilians to create new facts on the ground – makes defense challenging, because it must be countered without resorting to open combat. Although India has responded with heavy military deployments, Chinese forces remain in control of most of the areas they seized nearly a year ago. So far, China’s strategy is proving just as effective on land as it has been at sea.",
            "中国的喜马拉雅山区蚕食策略 新德里—在南海而没有造成代价，这让中国国家主席习近平的政权敢于在喜马拉雅山区复制这一模式。 特别是，中国在争议边境地带大手笔建设新村庄，以扩张或巩固其对于在印度、不丹和尼泊尔边境内的战略要地的控制。 中国在这些荒凉的无人居住边境地带大量建设新军事设施，更显出其在那里填充人口的战略意义。 这些新的设施包括电子战基站和、空军机场、地下军火库等。 中国的军事化建村运动让地区焦点集中在习近平的扩张主义战略上，而与此同时，尽管最近中印两军在其中一片地区脱离接触，但解放军仍有数万部队与印军发生多处对峙。 去年5月，印度突然发现解放军在其最北部的拉达克边境地带悄悄占领山顶和战略有利地形，此后，双方冲突不断。 中国新建设的喜马拉雅山区边境村庄与南海的人工岛异曲同工，习近平政权不费一枪一弹便改变了南海地缘政治版图。 习近平政权通过不对称混合战推动南海扩张，始终不触及公开武装冲突的红线。 这一方针将常规和非常规策略与“稍稍蚕食 ” 、 心里操纵、假信息、法律战以及强迫性外交相结合。 如今，中国正在将这一套用在喜马拉雅山区边境地带。 香港《南华早报》最近援引一份中国政府档案，报道说中国准备在喜马拉雅山区正义地带建设624处边境村庄。 中共以“扶贫”的名义冷酷无情地铲除西藏牧民，强迫他们如住孤立高海拔地区的人造新边境村庄。 中共还派汉族党员入驻这些村庄，监督居民。 炮制此前根本不存在的纠纷常常是中国领土主张的第一步，接着，它会暗中试图攫取意中地区。 习近平政权频繁利用民兵充当这一战略的先锋。 因此正如中国用渔政船在南海大肆扩张，它也一直将牧民和牲畜迁往喜马拉雅山区边境地带，以挑起事端和维持控制，然后再派兵常驻。 这一方针使其得以“日拱一卒 ” ， 逐步蚕食喜马拉雅山区领土。 根据国际法，领土主张必须基于在相关领土持续、和平地行使主权。 到目前为止，中国对喜马拉雅山区的助长都基于“强权即公理”的方针，寻求将其对西藏的吞并扩大到邻国边境地带。 通过建设新边境村庄并向那里移民，中国现在可以援引国际法支持它的主张。 在国际法中，有效控制是强领土主张的必要条件。 武装巡逻不能证明有效控制，定居可以。 中国改变喜马拉雅山区领土事实的隐秘性和速度 — — 以及其丝毫不顾地缘政治后果 — — 还反映出其他考量。 比如，边境村庄能约束敌军动用武力，便于中国的情报搜集和跨境行动。 卫星影像显示了这些村庄的建设速度，还有大量新修公路和军事设施。 中国政府最近论证了在在藏南地区建设新村庄的计划，说其 “从未承认”印度对该地区的主权。 中国的领土侵犯也没有放过全世界最小的国家不丹甚至尼泊尔，后者有一个亲中共的政府。 2017年，习近平号召西藏牧民在边境地区定居 ， “ 成为中国领土的卫士 ” ， 此后，中国开始设想边境村庄计划。 习近平说 ， “ 没有领土和平，就没有数百万家庭的平静生活 。 ” 但习近平的西藏“扶贫”计划 — — 自2019年以来声势日渐浩大 — — 核心乃是犬儒主义地将穷人安置到邻国的领土。 中国海洋扩张主义的回音扩张到了喜马拉雅山区环境。 据国际仲裁法庭，习近平在南海建岛的操作“给珊瑚礁环境造成了严重损害 ” 。 类似地，中国在边境地带修建村庄和军事设施也有可能给生态脆弱的喜马拉雅山区造成灭顶之灾，而这里是多条亚洲大河的源头。 环境破坏在曾经原生态的不丹主张的洞朗高原已显而易见，中国在2017年占领了洞朗高原，并将它变成了一个重军事地带。 印度陆军参谋长马诺伊·纳拉万（Manoj Naravane）最近宣称中国的蚕食策略“不会奏效 ” 。 但是，即便是印度这样的重要军事力量，也难以找到有效办法遏制中国在世界最不适宜居住和危险的边境地带的领土扩张。 中国的无弹侵略（bulletless aggression ） — —用军队支持的平民创造领土新事实 — — 难以防御，因为不能用公然对抗去制衡它。 尽管印度用部署重兵应对中国，但解放军仍控制着他们近一年前所侵占的大部分地区。 到目前为止，中国的战略在陆地上与海洋上一样有效。"

            "A China Optimist’s Lament NEW HAVEN – I have been a congenital China optimist for most of the past 25 years. I first came to that view in the depths of the Asian financial crisis in 1997-98. The so-called East Asian growth miracle was in tatters and China was widely portrayed as the final domino that would fall in what was then viewed as the first crisis of globalization. Having shuttled back and forth to the region during that period as Morgan Stanley’s chief economist, I had quickly come to appreciate the power of China’s market-based economic transition. So, in March 1998, I took a very different view on the pages of the Financial Times with my first published commentary on China, “The Land of the Rising Dragon.” My argument, in a nutshell, was that China would supplant Japan as the new engine of post-crisis Asia. Japan was floundering in the aftermath of its post-bubble implosion, whereas a reform-oriented China had the wherewithal, determination, and strategy to withstand the currency contagion of a devastating external shock and sustain rapid economic growth. As China delivered, boosted by its accession to the World Trade Organization in late 2001, and Japan sunk into its second lost decade, the Chinese economy took off like a rocket. It was the beginning of an extraordinary journey for me as Wall Street’s resident China optimist. In the spring of 1998, I spent a day in Seattle with then Chinese Finance Minister Xiang Huaicheng. He had read my piece in the FT and wanted to exchange views on the Chinese and US economies. He implored me to think of China less in terms of legacy state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and more through the lens of a rapidly emerging entrepreneurial subculture driven by township-village enterprises (TVEs). Xiang was kind enough to organize a subsequent tour of several TVEs in Fujian Province. The most impressive was the Hengtong Group, a rapidly growing producer of high-quality fiber optic and telecom cables. Loaded with state-of-the-art technology from the United States and Germany, and staffed with a surprisingly large number of college graduates, Hengtong was the opposite of China’s long-ossified SOEs. That experience whetted my appetite. I deepened my research into the seemingly paradoxical dynamism of China’s blended economy, with newly reformed and increasingly marketized SOEs starting to list shares in international capital markets in a balancing act with a rapidly growing private sector. Could China avoid the chronic problems that had long afflicted other blended systems, including Japan? This same question was posed by former Premier Wen Jiabao. I first met Wen in late 2002, a few months before his elevation to the premiership under President Hu Jintao. His curiosity impressed me more than his skills as a strategist, which had distinguished his predecessor, Zhu Rongji. But Wen had the courage to spark a debate about one of China’s toughest problems: In a public press conference in March 2007, he warned that while the economy was superficially strong, it risked becoming “unstable, unbalanced, uncoordinated, and unsustainable.” To Wen’s great credit, he posed the paradox of the “Four Uns” just a few months before the eruption of America’s subprime mortgage crisis, which would culminate in the 2008-09 global financial crisis. At this point, I doubled down as a China optimist. The resilience of the blended system – the legacy of Deng Xiaoping’s “reform and opening up” – held the key to what I believed would be a powerful rebalancing of the Chinese economy. Wen’s Four Uns could be resolved only by a structural shift from exports and investment to consumer-led growth, from manufacturing to services, from surplus saving to saving absorption by investing in a long-deficient social safety net, and by shifting from foreign to indigenous innovation. China’s flexible, blended, increasingly dynamic private sector could do all that and more. In the years following Wen’s proclamation, China’s five-year plans aligned with this rebalancing agenda. The case for a structural transformation to a more market-based system was increasingly on track. Optimists, like me, felt vindicated. Then came Xi Jinping. At first, China’s fifth-generation leader seemed to be cut from the same cloth as the reform-oriented Deng. A sweeping set of reforms proposed at the Third Plenum of the 18th Party Congress in late 2013 was especially encouraging. But shortly thereafter, uncomfortable frictions started to creep into the rebalancing strategy. In 2017, Xi kicked off the 19th Party Congress with a regression to Marxist ideology that immediately became known as “Xi Jinping Thought.” Consumer-led rebalancing was de-emphasized. An anti-corruption campaign became less about purging wrongdoers from the party and more about eliminating Xi’s political rivals and consolidating his power. And Xi’s geostrategic muscularity broke from Deng’s low-key (“hide and bide”) posture and led to a major conflict with the United States. But 2022 was the ultimate wake-up call for China optimists. Xi’s great-power gambit aligned China in an “unlimited partnership” with Russia on the brink of the Kremlin’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. Xi’s stubborn insistence on an untenable “zero-COVID” policy tapped an undercurrent of dissent not seen in a generation. And the 20th Party Congress in October was less about Xi’s claim to an unprecedented third term as general secretary and more about his fixation on security in what he dubbed to be a threatening world of “perilous, stormy seas.” With a shrinking working-age population, China, until recently the world’s greatest growth story, needs an acceleration in productivity growth to reclaim that mantle. Yet Xi’s increased emphasis on security, power, and control undermines productivity at a time when China needs it the most. The growth miracle can only suffer as a result. China had come close to the promised land. Its modern economy was on an extraordinary trajectory. The rebalancing agenda promised more to come. But Xi broke that promise. The political economy of autocracy has thrown cold water on those of us who used to be diehard China optimists.",
            "一个中国乐观分子的挽歌 发自纽黑文 — — 在过去25年的大部分时间里我一直都是个自发的中国乐观主义者。 我第一次形成这种观点是在1997~1998年亚洲金融危机最为深重之时。 所谓的东亚增长奇迹已是一地鸡毛，而中国则被广泛描述为将在全球化首次危机中倒下的最后一块多米诺骨牌。 作为摩根士丹利首席经济学家，我在那个时期多次往来于该地区并很快体会到了中国市场化经济转型的巨大力量。 因此1998年3月我在《金融时报》上发表了我的第一篇关于中国的评论文章《巨龙崛起的国度 》 ， 以此表达了自己与众人截然不同的观点。 简而言之，我的观点是中国将取代日本成为危机后亚洲的新引擎。 日本在泡沫破灭后陷入困境，而以改革为导向的中国则有能力、有决心、有战略来抵御毁灭性外部冲击所导致的货币危机蔓延并保持经济快速增长。 随着中国在2001年底加入世界贸易组织的推动下拿出了实际行动而日本则陷入了第二个失败的十年，中国经济像火箭一样起飞了。 对我这个常驻华尔街的中国乐观主义者来说，这是一段非凡旅程的开始。 1998年春天我在西雅图与时任中国财政部长项怀诚会面了一天。 他读了我在《金融时报》上的文章，想要就中国和美国的经济交换意见。 他恳请我少点从传统国有企业的角度看待中国，而更多地从乡镇企业驱动下迅速崛起的企业家亚文化角度去观察这个国家。 项怀诚还热心组织我们参观了几家福建乡镇企业。 最令人印象深刻的是亨通集团这个快速成长的高质量光纤和电信电缆生产商。 该集团拥有大量来自美国和德国的最先进技术，员工中的大学生数量之多令人惊讶，与中国长期僵化的国有企业犹如镜子的两面。 这一经历吊足了我的胃口。 我加深了对中国混合型经济 — — 开始登陆国际资本市场的新近改革和日益市场化国有企业与迅速增长的私营部门旗鼓相当 — — 所蕴含的看似矛盾的活力的研究。 试问中国能否避免长期困扰日本等其他混合经济体系的痼疾？ 前总理温家宝也提出了同样的问题。 我第一次见到温家宝是在2002年底 — — 当时距离他被胡锦涛主席提升为总理还有几个月。 他的好奇心比作为战略家的技能更让我印象深刻，这也有别于他的前任朱镕基。 但温家宝有勇气就中国其中一个最棘手的问题引发一场辩论。 在2007年3月的一次公开新闻发布会上，他警告说中国经济虽然看似强大，但它有可能变得“不稳定、不平衡，不协调和不可持续 ” 。 要知道他可是在美国次贷危机爆发前几个月提出这个“四不”悖论的，而该悖论也在2008~2009年全球金融危机中彻底地展现了出来。 从此以后我就成为了一个双料中国乐观主义者。 我相信混合体系 — — 邓小平改革开放政策的遗产 — — 的强韧性是中国经济强大再平衡的关键。 只有通过从出口和投资到消费者主导的增长、从制造业到服务业、从储蓄过剩到通过投资长期缺乏资金的社会安全网来吸收储蓄，还有从国外引进到本土创新的结构性转变才能解决温家宝的“四不”问题。 中国灵活、混合且越来越有活力的私营部门可以做到这一切（甚至更多 ） 。 在温家宝发表上述讲话后的那几年里，中国的五年计划与这个再平衡议程步调一致。 面向更加市场化体系实现结构性转型的进程越走越顺。 像我这样的乐观主义者也都觉得自己是正确的。 随后习近平上台了。 起初这位第五代领导人似乎与矢志改革的邓小平如出一辙。 2013年底在中共十八届三中全会上提出的一系列全面改革尤为令人鼓舞。 但没过多久一些令人不安的摩擦因素开始渗入再平衡战略。 2017年，习近平以向马克思主义意识形态的倒退拉开了中共十九大的序幕，这种倒退立即被定名为“习近平思想 ” 。 以消费者为主导的再平衡不再被强调。 反腐败运动不再是为了清除党内的不法分子，而是为了消灭习近平的政敌并巩固其权力。 习近平在地缘战略上的强硬态度打破了邓小平的低调 （ “ 韬光养晦 ” ） 姿态，同时引发了与美国的重大冲突。 而2022年则让中国乐观主义者们彻底醒悟了过来。 在克里姆林宫即将无端入侵乌克兰之时，习近平的大国博弈操作使中国与俄罗斯结成了“无上限伙伴关系 ” 。 他一味坚持却又难以维系的“新冠清零”政策激起了曾经消失了一代人时间的抗议风潮。 今年10月召开的中共第二十次全国代表大会与其说是为了让习近平拿下史无前例的第三任总书记任期，不如说是在其所谓 “惊涛骇浪”的危机世界中满足他对安稳的痴迷。 随着劳动年龄人口日益萎缩，直到最近还是世界上最伟大增长故事的中国需要加快生产力增长来重新扛起这面大旗。 然而习近平对安稳、权力和控制的日益强调却在中国最需要生产力的时候破坏了它。 这对增长奇迹只能有坏的影响。 中国已经接近了应许之地。 它的现代经济正处于一个非同寻常的发展轨道上。 再平衡议程承诺会有更多的发展，但习近平却打破了这一承诺。 对我们这些曾经的中国死忠乐观主义者来说，专制的政治经济学犹如在头上浇了一盆冷水。"

            "Will China Prove the Doomsayers Wrong? ATHENS – The new leadership team selected by Chinese President Xi Jinping at the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China failed to impress financial markets at home and abroad. In the week following the announcement of Xi’s new team, Hong Kong’s stock market declined by 8.3%, and the Shanghai Composite Index, China’s largest stock exchange, dropped 4%, despite the Chinese government’s intervention to prop up prices. US-listed Chinese stocks plunged by 15%. Investors have good reason to worry. Though financial markets had already priced in Xi’s third term, investors had hoped that he would appoint a team of more moderate, experienced officials capable of putting pragmatism above politics. Instead, Xi packed the Politburo and its Standing Committee with loyal allies and protégés. China’s next premier will be Li Qiang, who was Xi’s chief of staff (2004-07), before later serving as governor of Zhejiang province (2013-16), and CPC Secretary of Shanghai (2017-22). Li is widely credited with convincing Tesla to build its largest overseas factory in Shanghai – an achievement that has bolstered his business-friendly reputation. But, unlike every other premier since 1988, Li has no national-level administrative experience. Ding Xuexiang, the next executive vice premier of the State Council, has even less leadership experience under his belt, having spent the last ten years as Xi’s principal aide. In investors’ view, these officials lack the knowhow and independence to mount an effective response to the profound economic challenges China faces. Xi stands to benefit from these low expectations, with any minor success appearing significant and burnishing his government’s credibility. Here, perhaps the lowest-hanging fruit is the zero-COVID policy, which has devastated the economy and contributed to an urban youth unemployment rate of nearly 20%. At the Party Congress, Xi had little choice but to tout the policy as a major success, despite the devastation it has wrought. But with the meeting out of the way, and Xi starting his third term, the incentive to end the zero-COVID policy is strong. The boost to growth and employment – and to Li and Ding’s reputations – would be immediate. Xi’s new economic team would also benefit from easing regulatory pressure on China’s technology sector. Since the Chinese government began tightening the regulatory screws, private tech companies such as Alibaba and Tencent have suffered, and foreign investors have fled China in droves. Goldman Sachs estimated last year that the crackdown had wiped out roughly $3 trillion of the Chinese tech sector’s value. Given that the tech crackdown is widely viewed as excessive and counterproductive, any letup by the government would send positive signals to investors about the future of China’s tech sector, the new leadership team’s pragmatism, and the prospects for a return to robust economic growth. But China’s new leaders can make the greatest impression on investors if they can prove that they can handle the country’s toughest economic challenge: an imploding real-estate sector. Property sales are likely to drop by as much as 30% this year. Several large developers, such as Evergrande and Shimao, have defaulted on their debt. With funding cut off, many building projects remain unfinished, leading some angry home-buyers to stop making mortgage payments. This crisis will be the true test of the new economic team’s capabilities. Can they find a solution to widespread developer insolvency? Can they prevent the mass bankruptcy of local government financing vehicles, which took out massive bank loans using land as collateral? Can they find ways to ensure that new projects are not left unfinished? And can they stave off a housing-price collapse, as real-estate investment stops generating returns for the wealthy? Even partial success here would bring a massive payoff. The real-estate sector powered China’s economy for two decades, contributing 17-29% of China’s GDP growth. Its revival could thus put the country back onto a positive growth path. It is far from clear that Xi’s new team is capable of devising effective solutions to the real-estate crisis; after all, their predecessors were not, despite being far more experienced. But even if they are, there is good reason to doubt that Xi will allow a change in policy. Simply put, whether the doomsayers are proved right or wrong depends – like virtually everything else in China nowadays – on the man at the top.",
            "中国能证明那些唱衰者是错的吗？ 发自雅典—中国国家主席习近平在中国共产党第二十次全国代表大会上挑选出的新领导团队没能给国内外金融市场带来任何惊喜。 在习近平新班子发布后的一周内香港股市下挫了8.3 % ， 同时尽管中国政府出手托市，但（由中国最大股票交易所发布的）上海证券综合指数依然下跌了4 % ， 而在美国上市的中国企业股票则暴跌了15 % 。 投资者的担心是有理由的。 尽管金融市场已经在股价上消化了习近平第三任期的影响，但投资者希望他能任命一个更温和且更富有经验、能够将实用主义置于政治之上的官员团队，没想到政治局及其常委会却充斥着习近平的忠诚盟友和门徒。 中国的下一任总理将是曾担任习近平秘书长（2004~2007 ） ， 浙江省省长（2013~2016）和中共上海市委书记（2017~2022）的李强。 他因说服特斯拉在上海建立其最大海外工厂而广受赞誉 — — 这一成就增强了他对商界友好的名声。 但是与1988年以来上任的其他总理不同，李强缺乏中央经济工作经验。 而下一任国务院副总理丁薛祥的领导经验更少，他在过去十年中一直担任习近平的主要助手。 在投资者眼中这些官员缺乏足以对中国所面临的各项深刻经济挑战作出有效应对的知识和独立性。 习近平必将从这些低预期中获益，因为任何小成就都会显得意义重大并推高其政府公信力。 在这方面最容易取得的政绩或许就是放弃已经破坏了整个经济并导致城市青年失业率接近20%的新冠清零政策。 在二十大上习近平别无选择，只能将这项破坏巨大的政策吹捧为一项重大成就。 但是随着会议闭幕以及习近平开启第三个任期，结束新冠清零政策动机也会变得逐渐强烈。 此举对经济增长和就业的推动 — — 以及李强和丁薛祥的声誉提升 — — 都会是立竿见影的。 习近平的新任经济团队还会从对中国科技行业的放松监管中获益。 自从中国政府开始收紧监管以来阿里巴巴和腾讯等私营科技企业损失惨重，外国投资者纷纷逃离中国。 高盛公司去年估算镇压行动已经使中国科技行业损失了约3万亿美元市值。 鉴于科技行业的打击被广泛认为是过度且适得其反的，政府的任何放松都会向投资者发出积极的信号，向他们展现中国科技行业的未来、新领导团队的务实精神以及恢复强劲经济增长的前景。 但如果中国的新领导人能够证明自己能够处理中国最棘手的经济挑战（内爆的房地产业 ） ， 那就肯定能给投资者留下最为深刻的印象。 今年的房地产销售可能会下跌多达30 % 。 恒大和世茂等一些大型开发商已经出现债务违约。 由于资金被切断，许多建筑项目仍未完工，导致一些愤怒的购房者停止支付抵押贷款。 这场危机将是对新经济团队能力的真正考验。 他们能找到解决开发商大面积破产的办法吗？ 他们能否防止地方政府融资工具（这些工具以土地为抵押获得了大量银行贷款）的大规模破产？ 他们能找到办法确保新项目不出现停工？ 在房地产投资无法再为富人带来回报的情况下，他们能否避免住房价格的崩溃？ 在这方面即使实现一部分成功也会带来巨大的回报。 房地产行业为中国经济提供了20年的动力，贡献了中国17~29%的GDP增长，因此该行业的复兴是可以令中国重新走上正增长道路的。 目前还不清楚习近平的新团队是否有能力制定有效的房地产危机解决方案；毕竟他们那些经验更为丰富的前任们在这方面也没有建树。 但即使他们有这样的能力，我们也有充分理由去怀疑习近平会否允许改变政策。 简而言之，唱衰者被证明是正确或错误取决于 — — 正如当今中国的几乎所有其他事情一样 — — 最高领导人。"

            "Why Is the Uyghur Population Shrinking? MADISON, WISCONSIN – After becoming the Communist Party of China’s chief of Xinjiang Province in 2016, Chen Quanguo oversaw a security crackdown that led to a drop in births so sharp that it shocked the world. Some observers accused China’s leadership of committing genocide against the province’s mostly Muslim Uyghur population through forced sterilization and abortion. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi dismissed the allegations as “fake news,” arguing that Xinjiang’s Uyghur population had grown steadily to 12.7 million in 2018, an increase of 25% from 2010 – and higher than the 14% increase in the province’s total population. But recently released 2020 census figures have delivered what amounts to a slap in the foreign ministry’s face. The data show that in 2020, Xinjiang’s Uyghur population had grown by only 16% since 2010, to 11.6 million, compared to a 19% increase in Xinjiang’s total population. Even more shocking, the Uyghur population aged 0-4 was only 36% the size of that aged 5-9. The only comparable antecedent to this plunge in births was in Shandong Province in the early 1990s, where some Party officials tried to launch a campaign to go “newborn-free in 100 days.” By 2000, the population of 5-9 year olds in Tai’an, a city in Shandong, was only 28% the size of the cohort aged 10-14. Back in 1980, when Chinese authorities were discussing the one-child policy, there was even a creepy proposal to have a “newborn-free year” every few years. To understand why Xinjiang’s births have plummeted, it helps to review the history of population control in the province. China implemented family planning nationwide in 1973 and imposed the one-child policy in 1980. But for ethnic minorities in Xinjiang, family planning came later. Starting in 1989, minority urban couples in Xinjiang were allowed two children. Rural couples were allowed two as well, and were less likely to be forced to have abortions and sterilizations. Those “lenient” policies, combined with lagging education, led to higher fertility rates among Uyghurs. For example, the national fertility rates in 1989, 2000, and 2010 were 2.3, 1.22, and 1.18 children per woman, respectively, and 4.31, 2.0, and 1.84 for Uyghur women. Chen’s predecessor, Zhang Chunxian, was keen on population control when he was CPC secretary of Hunan Province from 2005 to 2010. Arguing that “to grasp family planning is to grasp productivity,” he launched a campaign to strengthen family planning in Hunan in 2006. The campaign swept up my cousin-in-law, who was forced to abort her first child a few days before her due date because she had not applied for a birth permit in time. In 2010, Zhang was reassigned to Xinjiang, and Hunan’s new governor, Xu Shousheng, arrived with plans to launch another campaign to strengthen population control in the province. In January 2011, I posted an “Open Letter to the Secretary and Governor of Hunan on Family Planning” online, euphemistically criticizing Zhang and Xu. In response, the Hunan authorities invited me to lecture on the topic in Hunan, and Ilham Tohti, a Uyghur economist and award-winning human-rights defender, joined me in calling for an end to family planning for the Uyghurs. Then, on July 31, 2014, Zhang published an essay in the CPC journal Seeking Truth, arguing that Xinjiang must “implement a family-planning policy that is equal for all ethnic groups” and must “lower and stabilize fertility at a moderate level.” I was so concerned that in March 2015, I published a peer-reviewed response in the journal Population and Society, entitled “The urgency of stopping population control in view of the low fertility rates of ethnic minorities.” In the event, Zhang did not strengthen family planning in Xinjiang. Births in the province remained stable during his tenure. But we now know that, under Chen’s rule, births plummeted from 389,695 in 2017 to 267,250 in 2018, and to 159,528 in 2021, implying three-quarters of a million fewer births in 2018-21. Since Chinese authorities have long been notorious for mandating abortion, sterilization, and intrauterine devices, it is natural to assume that the dramatic decline in births in Xinjiang reflects such measures. But matters are not so simple, because there were slightly fewer abortions and IUDs in Xinjiang in 2017-20 than in 2013-16; and though there were 70,000 more sterilizations, that figure is still an order of magnitude smaller than the drop in births. Given that couples in Xinjiang can legally have two or three children, it is unlikely that the authorities systematically forced abortions, ligations, and IUDs on women who had only one or two children. Why, then, was the Uyghur fertility rate in 2020 only one child per woman? Most likely, it is because Chen’s brutal crackdown both undermined Uyghur fertility habits (under the pretext of fighting Islamic extremism) and reduced the resources for parenting, through economic recession and rising unemployment. As rural Xinjiang suffered severe cultural repression and economic deprivation, the fertility rate in 2020 fell to an unusually low level compared to the province’s urban areas. Moreover, improved education has also contributed partly to the decline in births, by leading more women to delay marriage and childbearing. Chinese authorities have invested heavily to provide 15 years of free compulsory education in Xinjiang, compared with nine years nationwide. As a result, Xinjiang’s high-school gross enrollment rate increased from 69% in 2010 to 99% in 2020, while the nationwide rate rose from 83% to just 91%. Uyghurs have suffered from forced sterilization, of course. But it is this forced cultural shift that appears to have had more serious consequences for the birth rate. While the Chinese authorities have been very effective at lowering fertility rates, they have proved to be far less competent at boosting them. The recent “two-child” and “three-child” policies have both been abject failures. Looking ahead, every effort to encourage procreation in Xinjiang will fail if the region’s socioeconomic vitality continues to decline. This failure will cause China to lose its geopolitical advantage in Central Asia, where it is in a struggle for influence with Russia. China’s rulers have heaped praise on Chen, but they have yet to recognize that his security crackdown in Xinjiang sowed the seeds of severe long-term problems.",
            "维吾尔族人口为什么减少？ 威斯康星州麦迪逊—在 2016 年担任中共新疆自治区党委书记后，陈全国领导了一场安全镇压，导致新疆出生率急剧下降，震惊了世界。 一些观察家指责中国领导层通过强制绝育和堕胎对自治区以穆斯林为主的维吾尔族实施种族灭绝。 中国外交部长王毅将这些指控斥为“假新闻 ” ， 称新疆维吾尔族人口在 2018 年稳步增长至 1270 万，较 2010 年增长 25 % ， 高于全自治区总人口 14% 的增幅。 但最近公布的 2020 年人口普查数据相当于给外交部打了一记耳光。 数据显示，2020 年新疆维吾尔族人口自 2010 年以来仅增长 16 % ， 达到 1160 万，而新疆总人口增长了 19 % 。 更令人震惊的是，0-4岁的维吾尔族人口只有5-9岁的36 % 。 如此出生率急剧下降的唯一可比的先例是 1990 年代初期的山东省，当时一些党的官员试图发起“百日无孩”运动。 到 2000 年，山东泰安市 5-9 岁的人口仅为 10-14 岁人群的 28 % 。 早在 1980 年，当中国当局正在讨论独生子女政策时，甚至有一个令人毛骨悚然的提议，即每隔几年来一次“无新生儿年 ” 。 要了解新疆的出生人数为什么会直线下降，回顾一下该自治区人口控制历史是有帮助的。 中国从1973年开始实行全国计划生育，1980年实行一孩政策。 但对于新疆的少数民族来说，计划生育来得较晚。 从1989年开始，新疆少数民族城市夫妻可以生育两个孩子。 农村夫妻也被允许生育两个，并且不太可能被迫进行堕胎和绝育手术。 这些“宽松”的政策，加上落后的教育，导致维吾尔族生育率更高。 例如，1989 年、2000 年和 2010 年的全国生育率分别为每名妇女生育 2.3、1.22 和 1.18 个孩子，维吾尔族妇女为 4.31、2.0 和 1.84。 陈全国的前任张春贤在2005年至2010年担任湖南省委书记时热衷于人口控制。 他认为“抓计划生育就是抓生产力 ” ， 2006年在湖南发起了一场加强计划生育的运动。 这场运动席卷了我的表内妹，她在预产期前几天被强制流产第一个孩子，因为她没有及时申请准生证。 2010年，张春贤被调往新疆，湖南新任省长徐首晟到任就计划再发起一场加强全省人口控制的运动。 2011年1月，我在网上发表了《致湖南省委书记、省长关于计划生育的公开信 》 ， 委婉地批评了张春贤和徐首晟。 作为回应，湖南当局邀请我到湖南讲学，维吾尔族经济学家、屡获殊荣的人权卫士伊力哈木·土赫提与我一起呼吁停止维吾尔族计划生育。 随后，2014年7月31日，张春贤在中共党刊《求是》上发表文章，主张新疆必须“实行各族平等的计划生育政策 ” ， 要“把生育率降低和稳定在适度水平 。 ” 我非常担心， 2015 年 3 月，我在《人口与社会》杂志上发表了一篇同行评议的回应，题为《从少数民族生育率看停止从严控制人口政策的急迫性 》 。 在此事件中，张春贤没有加强新疆的计划生育。 在他任职期间，新疆出生人数保持稳定。 但我们现在知道，在陈全国主政时期，新疆出生人数从 2017 年的 389,695 人骤降到 2018 年的 267,250 人，再到 2021 年的 159,528 人，这意味着 2018-21 年出生人数减少了四分之三。 中国当局长期以来因强制实施堕胎、绝育和宫内节育器而臭名昭著，人们很自然会认为新疆出生率的急剧下降反映了这些措施。 但事情并没有那么简单，因为 2017-20 年新疆的人工流产和宫内节育器比 2013-16 年略少；尽管绝育人数增加了 70,000 人，但这个数字仍然比出生人数的下降要小一个数量级。 鉴于新疆夫妇可以合法生育两三个孩子，当局不太可能系统地强迫只有一两个孩子的妇女堕胎、结扎和放置宫内节育器。 那么，为什么维吾尔族 2020 年的生育率只有每名妇女一个孩子？ 很可能是因为陈全国的残酷镇压既破坏了维吾尔族的生育习惯（以打击伊斯兰极端主义为借口 ） ， 又因经济衰退和失业率上升而减少了养育子女的资源。 由于新疆农村遭受严重的文化压制和经济剥夺，2020年的生育率下降到与全区城市相比异常低的水平。 此外，教育水平的提高也导致更多妇女推迟结婚和生育，从而部分导致出生率下降。 中国当局投入巨资，在新疆提供 15 年免费义务教育，而全国范围为 9 年。 结果，新疆高中毛入学率从2010年的69%上升到2020年的99 % ， 而全国的毛入学率从83%上升到91 % 。 当然，维吾尔人遭受过强制绝育。 但似乎是这种强制性的文化转变对出生率产生了更严重的后果。 中国当局在降低生育率方面非常高效，但事实证明，他们在提高生育率方面的能力要差得多。 近期的“二孩”和“三孩”政策均以惨败告终。 展望未来，如果该地区的社会经济活力继续下降，新疆所有鼓励生育的努力都将失败。 这一失败将导致中国失去在中亚的地缘政治优势。 它正在与俄罗斯角逐中亚影响力。 中国统治者对陈全国评价很高，但没有认识到他在新疆的安全镇压埋下了严重的长期祸根。"

            "When Xi Meets Obama CLAREMONT, CALIFORNIA – As Chinese President Xi Jinping begins his trip to the United States in Seattle, home to many of the world’s leading technology firms, most observers are looking ahead to his subsequent meeting with President Barack Obama. Can the summit reverse the downward spiral in US-China relations that began with Xi’s accession to power in 2013? Few dispute that the world’s most important bilateral relationship is in deep trouble. From the US perspective, China’s reckless behavior in the South China Sea, unrestrained cyber attacks against American targets, protectionist economic policies, and escalating political repression at home have demolished the belief that a globally integrated China would be a responsible and cooperative partner. Indeed, recent Chinese actions directly challenge vital American interests and core values. Chinese leaders, for their part, view America’s strategic “pivot to Asia” as a thinly veiled step to tighten its geopolitical containment of China. Moreover, they have become obsessed with US dominance in international finance and technology and, most important, America’s ideological commitment to liberal democracy, which they regard as an existential threat to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). The toxic mix of mutual mistrust and tit-for-tat behavior has brought Sino-American ties to their lowest point since the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989. There is now widespread concern that the US and China may be headed for a new cold war. For Xi, the stakes of his US trip could not be higher. To maintain his domestic image as a strong leader, he must stick to his nationalist rhetoric and policies. But he also needs to stabilize the all-important relationship with the US. Judging by recent moves by China and the US, we can expect modest success in a few contentious areas. While such improvements, on their own, will not change the relationship’s adversarial dynamic, they may halt the deterioration in bilateral ties, at least for now. On the eve of the summit, both the US and China took positive, albeit symbolic, steps to demonstrate their goodwill and improve the diplomatic atmosphere. The US extradited a low-level Chinese official to face corruption charges. The Obama administration also decided not to announce sanctions against Chinese entities and individuals allegedly involved in cyber attacks on American companies and government agencies. For its part, China released a human-rights activist and dispatched a high-level delegation to the US to discuss cyber security. In fact, the two sides are reportedly negotiating a landmark deal that would prohibit cyber attacks against each other’s vital infrastructure. An agreement on the issue could be the most important outcome of the summit, although other types of cyber attacks are unlikely to be covered by it. For China, the biggest prize is a bilateral investment treaty (BIT). In practical terms, a US-China BIT would make it easier for Chinese entities to invest and operate in the US and increase American firms’ access to Chinese markets. Such a deal would be a near-term boon for Xi, because it would represent a vote of confidence by the US in China’s struggling economy. But the prospects for a BIT are uncertain, at best. The US Congress is deeply skeptical, and the American business community needs convincing as well. Both have been bitterly disappointed by China’s mercantilist trading policies after its accession to the World Trade Organization. Given how many contentious issues remain unresolved, an accord is unlikely during the summit. The South China Sea dispute may prove to be the toughest diplomatic nut to crack. China has staked its national prestige and its leadership’s nationalist credentials on this issue, which means that Xi is likely to rebuff US demands that China cease all activities seen as militarizing its new artificial islands in disputed waters. The most that can be realistically expected is an insipid statement of the two sides’ agreement to disagree. But the most politically sensitive topic for China has little to do with cyber security or the South China Sea. It is China’s ongoing crackdown on civil liberties and human rights. Facing enormous domestic pressure, Obama has announced that human rights will be on the agenda of his summit with Xi. But Xi is unlikely to make any concessions, because doing so could damage his political standing within the CCP and undermine a central component of his political vision: the reassertion of political control over a dynamic society. Ultimately, the key question looming over the summit is whether Xi will be able to offer enough to repair the damage done to Sino-US relations in recent years. To be sure, trying is better than doing nothing. But what really matters is whether, after the summit, China takes concrete actions that reflect a genuine shift from the policies that have fueled the deterioration in bilateral ties.",
            "当习近平遇见奥巴马 克莱蒙特，加利福尼亚—中国国家主席习近平在西雅图开始了访美之旅。 西雅图是许多世界领先的科技公司的总部所在地。 许多观察者正在期待他随后与美国总统奥巴马的会面。 两人的峰会是否能够扭转2013年习近平上台以来中美关系恶化的趋势？ 毫无疑问，全世界最重要的双边关系陷入了深深的麻烦。 从美国的角度，中国在南海的“任性”行为、无节制的针对美国目标的网络攻击、保护主义经济政策和逐步升级的对内政治压迫使其无法再相信融入全球的中国将是负责任的合作伙伴。 事实上，最近中国的行为直接挑战了美国的核心利益和核心价值。 而中国领导人将美国战略性“重返亚洲”视为欲盖弥彰的加紧对华地缘政治遏制的措施。 此外，他们着迷于美国在国际金融和科技方面的主宰地位以及，更重要的，美国坚定的自由民主意识形态（他们视为中共的生存威胁 ） 。 互不信任和针锋相对行为构成了一个危害重重的组合，让中美关系跌至1989年天安门事件以来的最低点。 如今，人们广泛担忧美国和中国可能开始新的冷战。 对习近平来说，此次访美可谓意义重大。 要想维持其强势领导人的国内形象，他必须坚持其民族主义口风和政策。 但他也需要稳定最重要的对美关系。 从中国和美国最近的动作判断，我们可以期待双方在一些有争议的领域取得些许成功。 这些改善本身不会改变中美关系的对抗动态，但也许能够阻止双边关系的恶化，至少在当前是如此。 在峰会即将到来之际，美国和中国领导人都采取了积极（尽管是象征性）的举措证明各自的良好意愿、改善外交氛围。 美国遣返了一名面临腐败指控的低级中国官员。 奥巴马政府还决定不对被控参与对美国公司和政府机构发动网络袭击的中国单位和个人进行制裁。 中国则释放了一位人权活动家，并派了一个高规格代表团来到美国讨论网络安全问题。 事实上，双方据称正在谈判一项里程碑式的协议，禁止互相网络攻击关键基础设施。 在这一问题上形成协议可能是峰会最重要的成果，尽管该协议不可能覆盖其他类型的网络袭击。 对中国来说，最大的好处是双边投资条约。 从务实角度，中美双边投资条约将让中国单位更加方便地赴美投资和经营，也能促进美国企业进入中国市场。 对习近平来说，这一协议是一个短期福音，因为这代表美国对陷入困境的中国经济充满信心。 但双边投资条约的前景并不确定。 美国国会深刻地怀疑中国，而美国企业界也需要确信。 国会和企业界都因为中国加入世贸组织后采取的重商主义贸易政策而大失所望。 考虑到众多争议问题尚未解决，峰会期间不太可能形成协议。 南海纠纷也许是最棘手的外交问题。 中国在这一问题上押上了国家尊严和领导人的民族主义情操，这意味着习近平可能会断然拒绝美国要求中国停止所有被视为对其在争议海域的新造人工岛进行军事化改造的行为。 从现实角度，我们最多能够期待双方发表一些无关痛痒的承认分歧的声明。 但对中国来说，政治上最敏感的话题既非网络安全，亦非南海，而是中国一直在镇压公民自由和人权的问题。 面临巨大国内压力的奥巴马已经宣布人权将是其与习近平峰会的议程之一。 但习近平不可能做出任何让步，因为这样做将危害到他在中共党内的政治立场，也有害于其政治愿景的一个关键要素：重新获得对充满活力的社会的政治控制。 最终，峰会的关键问题是习近平是否拿出足够的诚意修复近几年来中美关系所遭到的破坏。 诚然，做点尝试比什么都不做要好。 但真正重要的是峰会之后中国是否拿出实际行动证明其真正开始远离那些加剧双边关系恶化的政策。"

            "When Leninists Overreach MOSCOW – Ongoing street protests in Hong Kong and Moscow have no doubt spooked the authoritarian duo of Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Moscow protests, the largest in many years, must be keeping Putin up at night, or they wouldn’t be dispersed with such unabated brutality. Yet rather than hold a dialogue with the people, Putin has been demonstrating that he is in control, even preening for photos in a tight leather outfit with his favorite motorcycle gang. Nonetheless, the demonstrations have become a poignant sign of Putin’s declining popularity, including among Russian elites, whose views matter in ways that other forms of public opinion do not. For two decades, the Russian elite’s rival factions have generally seen Putin as the ultimate guarantor of their interests – particularly their financial interests. But as Russia’s economy has sunk into sanctions-induced stagnation, Putin’s leadership has started to look like more of a roadblock than a guardrail. Fewer and fewer Russians still accept that “Putin is Russia and Russia is Putin,” a mantra that one heard regularly just five years ago, following the Kremlin’s annexation of Crimea. Moreover, Putin’s hope that US President Donald Trump would improve relations with Russia has begun to look short-sighted, if not downright delusional. Although Trump has weakened American institutions and undermined Western alliances, which has played into Putin’s hands, the White House has also rendered US foreign policy utterly unpredictable. Worse, the Trump administration is now systematically unwinding the arms-control accords that long brought some degree of certainty to nuclear affairs. Russian elites know that their country is as ill-prepared to win a nuclear-arms race with the United States now as the Soviet Union was in previous decades. The recent explosion of a nuclear-missile engine at a test site on Russia’s northern Arctic coast is a grim reminder of a deep-seated incompetence. And unlike Putin, Russian elites are deeply worried that alienating the US will make Russia a de facto vassal state vis-à-vis China. The protests in Hong Kong, which show no sign of abating, are likewise the product of authoritarian overreach. They began with a proposed law that would allow Hong Kong citizens and residents to be extradited to the Chinese mainland. Given how clumsily the legislation was presented by Hong Kong’s Beijing-backed leader, Carrie Lam, it is possible that the Chinese leadership was only dimly aware of it and its potential political impact. Nonetheless, the Chinese government’s response to the protests has been increasingly self-defeating. For starters, the People’s Liberation Army has been openly threatening to intervene to shut down the protests against Lam’s government. And in cases where pro-government “triad” thugs, most likely based on the mainland, have shown up to assail protesters, the police have been conveniently absent. As everyone in Hong Kong knows, these extrajudicial beatings had to have been sanctioned by Xi’s government. More ominously, Xi may have already decided that the time for “one country, two systems” has passed. China, he might argue, can no longer tolerate a functioning quasi-democracy within its territory, despite the agreement it accepted as a condition of Hong Kong’s return to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. Concerned about Taiwan and its political drift ever further from the mainland, Xi may be thinking that a harsh Hong Kong policy will scare the Taiwanese into line. If so, he has forgotten that bullying Taiwan has only ever yielded the opposite of what China intended. Then again, Xi may be contemplating something even worse. If he has concluded that Trump’s “America First” administration would do nothing to protect Taiwan, he could be considering a lightning military strike on the island to bring it back under the mainland’s control. But this, too, would be a mistake. Given the broader context of Sino-American relations, even the Trump administration would likely respond to Chinese military adventurism in Taiwan. Besides, the US need not engage in an open military confrontation with China to make aggression toward Taiwan more trouble than it is worth. The US Navy still has the capacity to cut off the sea lanes supplying energy and minerals to China, regardless of whether it is actively engaged in the South China Sea. As with Putin, overreach seems to be Xi’s default position nowadays, judging by his handling of the trade war and aggressive behavior toward China’s neighbors. In fact, Xi’s muscle-flexing has been so heedless that China now finds itself increasingly isolated diplomatically. Almost all the world’s leading military and economic powers – the European Union, India, Japan, Brazil – maintained pragmatic relations with Xi’s predecessors. But they have since grown increasingly wary of China, with some even moving closer to the US (in the age of Trump, no less). As in Russia’s case, China’s elite will no doubt have noticed that Xi is turning the country into an international pariah. The outside world may assume that China’s senior leadership is as subservient to Xi as the Kremlin is to Putin. But that is also what many thought about the Soviet politburo and Nikita Khrushchev back in 1964. Khrushchev was ousted before the end of the year. There is an old joke in which the long-serving Soviet foreign minister, Andrei Gromyko, quips, “We had to remove Khrushchev. He was so reckless a gambler, we would be lucky to hang on to Moscow if he continued.” Khrushchev was indeed impulsive when he precipitated the Cuban Missile Crisis. But he was motivated by a desire to maintain military parity with the US. He did not share the Stalinesque delusions of grandeur that seem to be driving Putin and Xi to wager their own countries’ futures. Today, no one should assume that either leader will be spared Khrushchev’s fate, or even Stalin’s grim death, which was long rumored to have been perpetrated by his own entourage, whose members had tired of his despotic overreach.",
            "列宁主义者的过犹不及 莫斯科—毫无疑问，香港和莫斯科的街头示威让中国国家主席习近平和俄罗斯总统普京这对极权二人组噤若寒蝉。 莫斯科示威规模堪称多年来之最，想必已令普京辗转反侧，否则不会遭到如此粗暴的驱散。 但普京并没有与人民开展对话，而是一直表现出一切尽在掌控，甚至穿着紧身衣，与心爱的摩托车一同拗了一个飙车党造型。 尽管如此，莫斯科大游行尖锐地表明，普京的支持率正在下降，包括他在俄罗斯精英群体中的支持率，后者的思路与公共观点不太一样。 二十年来，俄罗斯精英的对立派系总体上将普京视为他们的利益的最终保护人 — — 特别是金融利益。 但随着俄罗斯经济陷入了制裁所导致的停滞，普京的领导地位开始越来越象是路障，而不是护栏。 仍然接受“普京就是俄罗斯，俄罗斯就是普京”的俄罗斯人越来越少，而在五年前克里姆林宫吞并克里米亚后，你时不时能听到这样的话。 此外，普京希望美国总统特朗普会改善对俄关系，这看起来形势不妙，甚至已经成为泡影。 尽管特朗普削弱了美国的制度，也破坏了西方联盟，这些都有利于普京，但白宫也让美国外交政策变得极难预测。 更糟糕的是，特朗普政府正在系统性地退出裁军协议。 长期以来，这些协议能够为核事务带来了一些确定性。 俄罗斯精英知道，俄罗斯不像几十年前的苏联那样，早已做好了赢得与美国的核军备竞赛的准备。 最近，俄罗斯北冰洋沿岸的一次核导弹引擎爆炸事故残酷地提醒俄罗斯的无能。 和普京不同，而落i精英非常担心疏远美国会让俄罗斯沦为中国的事实附庸。 香港示威 — — 目前尚无缓和迹象 — — 也是极权主义过犹不及的产物。 示威始于一宗允许香港公民和居民被引渡到中国大陆的法律草案。 受北京支持的香港领导人林郑月娥提出这一立法可谓愚钝，有可能中国领导层并没有认识到这一点及其潜在政治影响。 尽管如此，中国政府对示威的反应越来越自相矛盾。 首先，解放军公开威胁要进行干预，镇压反对林郑政府的示威。 而每当亲政府的“三合会”暴徒（很有可能来自内地）出来攻击示威者时，警察总是难觅其踪。 所有香港人都知道，这些法外私刑受到了习近平政府的支持。 更凶险的是，习近平可能已经认为 ， “ 一国两制”的时代已经过去了。 他也许认为，中国不能再容忍境内出现运转良好的准民主体制，尽管中国再1997年收回香港主权时接受了这一条件。 习近平可能担心台湾及其政局与大陆渐行渐远，觉得强硬的香港政策能恫吓台湾，使之屈服。 果真如此的话，说明他忘了霸凌台湾只能带来与中国想要的相反的效果。 同样，习近平可能在想一些更加糟糕的事情。 如果他认定，特朗普的“美国优先”政府不会出手保护台湾，那么他就可以考虑对台动武，让其重回大陆的控制。 但这将是一个错误。 放到中美关系的大环境下，哪怕是特朗普政府，对于中国军事入侵台湾也会有所反应。 此外，美国不需要与中国公开军事对峙，就能让侵略台湾得不偿失。 美国海军仍然有能力切断中国的海上能源和矿产补给线，不管其目前是否积极介入了南海局势。 和普京一样 ， “ 过度”似乎是习近平眼下的默认立场，从其对贸易战的处置以及对邻国的侵略行为便可一窥端倪。 事实上，习近平的大秀肌肉可谓失察，中国现在在外交上日益孤立。 全球i几乎所有军事和经济力量 — — 欧盟、印度、日本、巴西 — — 与习近平的前任们都保持着务实的关系。 但随后它们对中国日益担忧，有的甚至与美国越走越近（在特朗普时代又有所远离 ） 。 和俄罗斯的例子一样，中国精英肯定也已经注意到习近平正在将国家变成国际贱民。 外部世界可能会认为，中国高级领导层对习近平俯首帖耳，一如克里姆林宫对普京。 但1964年，许多人也是这么看待苏联政治局和赫鲁晓夫的。 赫鲁晓夫在那一年年底被推翻。 有一个老笑话，任职时间漫长的苏联外交部长安德烈·葛罗米科（Andrei Gromyko）辞职 ， “ 我们必须搞掉赫鲁晓夫。 他是个鲁莽的赌徒，如果他继续下去的话，我们能紧紧抓牢莫斯科就不错了 。 ” 赫鲁晓夫在猛然面对古巴导弹危机时确实有些鲁莽。 但他的动机是保持与美国相当的军事力量。 他没有斯大林式的宏伟幻觉，而普京和习近平似乎正是受到这一幻觉的驱使，拿国家的未来做赌注。 如今，我们都不应该认为两位领导人会遭遇与赫鲁晓夫同样的命运，甚至像斯大林一样的悲惨结局 — — 向来有传言说，他死于自己的随从之手，他们对他的暴君作风忍无可忍。"

            "The Sino-American Employment Challenge HONG KONG – Donald Trump’s rise to power in the United States involved more than a little China-bashing. Yet, with Chinese President Xi Jinping’s visit to Trump’s Florida estate earlier this month, it seems that the status quo in the bilateral relationship – crucial for global trade, growth, and stability – will be maintained. That could be very good news for Chinese and US workers alike. At the summit, Xi reiterated China’s commitment to maintaining a positive relationship with the US. “We have a thousand reasons to get China-US relations right,” he said, “and not one reason to spoil” them. Trump, for his part, accepted Xi’s invitation to visit China soon. On trade, Trump and Xi agreed to a 100-day plan for discussions on reducing the US trade deficit with China. Moreover, the US accepted China’s proposal to revamp the framework for bilateral engagement by creating the US-China Comprehensive Dialogue, consisting of four sub-dialogues: diplomacy and security, economic issues, law enforcement and cybersecurity, and social and cultural affairs. The understanding between Xi and Trump reflected a sober acknowledgement of the domestic and international risks their countries face. Both seemed to recognize that a stable US-China relationship is necessary to enable them to focus on their respective challenges. For Xi, those challenges include supply-side structural reforms to address corruption, pollution, rising debt, overcapacity, and low productivity. As for Trump, the main imperative is to overcome political and institutional obstacles to fulfilling his promises, including to reduce taxes and invest in infrastructure. But there is one key challenge that both leaders have in common: jobs. Technological advances, especially in automation and robotics, are putting a growing number of jobs under pressure. In the US, that pressure was a driving force behind Trump’s election (though it was often and disproportionately blamed on immigrants and developing-country exporters, including China). But in China, too, technology-driven job insecurity could pose a threat to political stability. According to a report released by US President Barack Obama’s administration last year, anywhere from 9% to 47% of jobs will be threatened by automation during the coming decade. More recently, McKinsey released its own report on the topic, in which it estimates that about 60% of all occupations could undergo automation of 30% or more of their constituent activities. Now, world leaders – beginning with Trump and Xi – must figure out how to sustain employment, as existing jobs disappear. The Obama administration’s study recommended a three-pronged approach: investment in artificial intelligence (to take advantage of its benefits); education and training of workers for the jobs of the future; and aid for workers in transition. This is all well and good, but one imperative is missing: ensuring that enough new jobs actually are created. In both the China and the US, job disruptions are subject to sectoral and geographic imbalances. Driverless cars, for example, will threaten some 2-3 million jobs in the US. Those job losses will hit workers in some sectors – beginning with personal and freight transport – particularly hard. Similarly, the effects of automation on factory workers tend to be concentrated in particular regions. America’s Rust Belt, which once boasted a powerful manufacturing sector, is already suffering the consequences of automation. In China, it is the northeastern region that is being hit hardest by job losses, owing to overcapacity and the closure of polluting and loss-making heavy industries. But the most consequential asymmetry affecting the job-creation challenge may be the one between institutions and policies. Sharp increases in government employment are usually fiscally unsustainable and even counterproductive, as they can crowd out the private sector. Yet large enterprises – whether private or state-owned – are in job-reduction mode, driven either by profit or efficiency pressures. This leaves small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) to pick up the slack. China’s SMEs are certainly capable of doing so. Indeed, even if large enterprises were not currently shedding workers, they would be at a disadvantage vis-à-vis more efficient and innovative SMEs in an economy transformed by interactive Internet platforms. Consider e-commerce. As a recent report by the Alibaba Research Institute points out, e-commerce is transforming the relationship between customers and businesses. What was once a business-to-consumer supply-and-distribution model has become far more interactive, with customers constantly delivering feedback to which businesses must constantly adapt. Large Internet platforms like Alibaba can use Big Data and smart analytics to monitor such changes. But large established firms cannot respond to those changes – say, by adjusting what they are producing or how they are distributing it – with the same speed and flexibility as their SME counterparts. Despite the potential of SMEs to produce valuable innovation and create jobs, however, the sector has been woefully neglected by policymakers. For example, tax incentives do not account for SMEs’ positive externalities in terms of job creation and innovation. And, because of the risks of individual failures, SMEs often face higher costs for bank credit, particularly in China. As the world’s two largest consumer markets and leading trade partners, China and the US can do much to help each other overcome the barriers to increased, broad-based, and high-quality job creation. The US has the technology, talent, and regulatory experience to continue to lead the way on innovation, supporting job creation in new and future-oriented industries and activities. And China’s move toward a consumption-led economy, driven by an increasingly modern services sector, is likely to boost demand for high-quality and innovative US goods and services. The result would be a much more balanced trade relationship and, potentially, a new global partnership for development. With that in mind, one can only hope that Trump maintains the cooperative spirit demonstrated at the recent Florida summit.",
            "中美合作应对新经济时代就业挑战 香港—特朗普为了当选美国总统，采取了不少抨击中国的策略。 但本月初中国国家主席习近平与特朗普在其佛罗里达庄园的会晤显然具有稳定中美关系现状的作用。 中美关系对于全球贸易、增长和稳定有着至关重要的意义，这次会晤对于中国和美国的工人来说都是非常好的消息。 在峰会上，习近平重申了中国保持对美良好关系的承诺。 “我们有一千条理由把中美关系搞好 ， ” 他说 ， “ 没有一条理由把中美关系搞坏 。 ” 特朗普则接受了习近平的邀请，将于近期访华。 在贸易方面，特朗普和习近平同意启动一个百日计划，讨论如何减少美国对华贸易赤字。 此外，美国也接受了中国关于通过建立中美全面对话来改善双边关系的一个框架性的建议，对话包括四个方面：外交与安全、经济问题、执法与网络安全，以及社会和文化事务。 习近平与特朗普之间的相当积极的互相理解反映出他们对各自国家所面临的国内和国际风险有着清醒的认识。 两人都认识到，稳定的中美关系是他们能够专注于各自挑战的必要条件。 对习近平来说，这些挑战包括供给侧结构改革以解决腐败、污染、债务增加、产能过剩和生产率低下问题。 对特朗普来说，当务之急是克服政治和制度障碍，实现包括减税和基础设施投资在内的竞选承诺。 但两国都面临一个共同的关键挑战：创造就业。 科技进步，特别是自动化和机器人，让越来越多的工作岗位处于压力之中。 在美国，这一压力是特朗普当选的推动力之一（尽管人们常常错误地将就业问题归咎于移民和包括中国在内的发展中国家的出口 ） 。 而在中国，科技导致的就业问题同样也可能给政治稳定造成威胁。 据去年美国总统奥巴马政府发布的报告，未来十年将有9 % — 47%的就业岗位受到自动化的威胁。 最近，麦肯锡也发布了有关这个问题的报告，其中估算，大约60%的岗位中可能发生30%或以上的工作将被自动化机器代替。 如今，任何世界领导人 — — 从特朗普和习近平开始 — — 必须找到办法在现有工作岗位不断消失的情况下维持就业。 奥巴马政府的研究报告建议采取三管齐下的方针：投资人工智能（以利用其收益 ） ； 为工人提供未来就业岗位所需要的教育和培训；以及在转型过程中为工人提供补助。 这一方针虽好，但忽略了一个当务之急：确保实际上能够创造足够多的新岗位。 没有新岗位，培训得再好的工人还是没有工作。 在中国和美国，就业岗位危机都受到产业和地区结构失衡的影响。 比如，无人驾驶汽车将在美国威胁到200—300万个工作岗位。 这些岗位损失对于某些产业 — — 如客运和货运交通 — — 的冲击将特别严重。 类似地，自动化对工厂工人的影响主要集中在特定的地区。 美国的锈带，即昔日引以为豪的强大的制造业基地，已经在承受自动化所带来的后果。 在中国，由于产能过剩和重污染、高亏损的重工业企业的倒闭，受就业岗位损失冲击最大的是东北地区。 但影响就业创造最严重的障碍也许是用人机构与就业政策之间的不协调。 政府就业的急剧增加常常令财政不堪重负，甚至产生适得其反的效果，因为这可能挤出民营部门的扩张。 而大企业 — — 不论是民营还是国有 — — 都处于裁员的压力中，或者是因为利润萎缩，或者是为了减员增效。 这意味着中小企业必须填补未来就业的空白。 中国中小企业显然有能力完成这一任务。 事实上，即使大企业目前没有裁员，它们面对一个被互动性互联网平台所改变的新经济中的高效创新的中小企业也不存在优势。 以电子商务为例。 阿里巴巴研究所的最新报告指出，电子商务正在改变客户与企业之间的关系。 曾经的企业-消费者供销模式互动性大大增强，客户可以随时提供反馈，而企业必须随时根据反馈做出调整。 阿里巴巴等大型互联网平台可以利用大数据和智能分析监控这些变化。 但老牌大企业则无法以中小企业同行一样的速度和弹性应对这些变化 — — 它们往往很难调整其固有的产品生产及分销渠道。 尽管中小企业在创造有价值的创新和就业岗位方面潜力巨大，可惜它们往往被决策者忽视了。 比如，税收激励往往没有考虑中小企业在就业创造和创新方面的正外部性。 此外，由于担心企业风险和破产，中国的中小企业常常面临更高的银行信用成本。 作为全世界最大的两个消费市场和主要贸易伙伴，中国和美国在互相帮助，克服障碍，增加广泛的高质量就业岗位方面大有可为。 美国拥有领先的技术、人才和监管经验，可以继续引领创新、支持在未来导向的行业和项目中创造工作岗位。 而中国向消费拉动及现代化服务业驱动型经济的转型可以刺激对高质量的创新性美国商品与服务的需求。 中美合作的结果将是更加平衡的贸易关系，并有望形成新的全球发展合作伙伴关系。 但愿特朗普能将他在最近的佛罗里达峰会上所表现出来的合作精神保持下去。"

            "Why Work at Work? PHUKET – Marissa Mayer, the new CEO of Yahoo!, recently created a fuss by issuing an edict that forbids anyone at the company to work from home. Mayer’s demarche received a lot of press coverage, probably more than it deserved. That may not be so surprising: she is a woman, and she allegedly has a nursery for her baby next door to her office. Above all, people seemed to react to the categorical nature of her decision (why everyone?) and to the irony that Yahoo! is a tech company (don’t they know about Skype?). I think that Mayer made the right decision, and I am sure that over time exceptions to her order will be allowed at managers’ discretion. But, until now, the “right” to work at home was sacrosanct at Yahoo!, something that an employee’s manager could not overrule. And, by all accounts, enough people at Yahoo! were not working, either from home or from more interesting places, that it had become a serious problem. Beyond that, Mayer’s edict makes more sense as a means of cultural change within a business than it does as a way to improve any particular individual’s productivity. Almost precisely because working remotely is easy, the advantage that a workplace has over a collection of home workers – or a set of outsourced workers assembled through Task Rabbit – is that people can accomplish more in a setting that provides a common culture and the benefit of serendipitous connections. Long ago, the advantage of a firm was that it lowered transaction costs (an idea first clearly expressed by the Nobel laureate economist Ronald Coase), such as the costs of finding workers, assigning them to tasks, assessing productivity, and setting salaries. Now that transaction costs are so low, the primary benefit of working at work is that the physical interactions foster an organizational culture and boost creativity, rather than efficiency or productivity, within an established routine. Mayer, I think, did not order her employees back to the office merely because some people were not actually working at home; rather, many of those who were working were not working together. To be sure, it seems contradictory to some people that Yahoo!, an online business, requires its employees to be physically present in the company’s offices. But most of the money and talent in this industry already seem to concentrate physically in one small part of the United States, between San Francisco and San Jose. Whether it’s the Yahoo! Cafeteria (now more inviting and more frequented with the advent of free food), or the halls of the Plug & Play startup accelerator, proximity matters. Being physically present at work means direct contact with other sharp and creative minds. And the benefits of human contact and interaction are why salespeople still call on customers instead of using Skype, and why Meetup (which supports organizers of face-to-face meetings; I am on the company’s board) changes lives in ways that Twitter and Facebook rarely do. Of course, those who prefer to work at home cite not just the cost and time of commuting, but also the proliferation of meetings – too much culture, perhaps – and a steady flood of communication that simply interrupts their work rather than enhancing it. Interestingly, I heard this point at a WPP Stream “unconference” in Phuket, Thailand, where a couple of hundred people had flown thousands of miles to meet face to face to share ideas and strengthen working relationships. So, yes, online work can make a lot of sense in many situations, but when you are trying to fix a broken corporate culture, you need the commitment, human engagement, and creative interaction that happen most consistently in a physical workplace. In the end, it is up to good managers to decide who can work where, and to make meetings short and useful. Indeed, the whole point of having managers is that they are supposed to exercise judgment. Otherwise, computers and the Internet would allow us not just to work from home, but to report to a software program rather than to a person. But, in the end, the challenge is to find the right fit between people and environment. Personally, I come at this from the opposite direction. As an independent angel investor with no real day job, I don’t have an office to report to every day. But I would miss the companionship of people working around me – even if they do not necessarily work with me. Fortunately, Meetup allows me to sit at a desk amid its roughly 90 people; I travel a lot, but I work from a desk at Meetup whenever I am at “home” in New York City. True, I don’t have to go to the company’s meetings, but I like being surrounded by busy people; I know it makes me work harder. Whatever our work, we remain physically social beings.",
            "为什么要上班工作？ 普吉岛—最近，雅虎新CEO玛丽莎·梅耶（Marissa Mayer）发布公告禁止雅虎员工在家办公，此禁令掀起了一阵波澜。 梅耶的这一新政吸引了大量媒体注意，以致有大惊小怪之嫌。 这或许并不那么令人惊奇：她是女人，而且据说她办公室隔壁就有托儿所可以照顾她的孩子。 毕竟，激起人们反弹的是她的决定的绝对性（为何所有人都得如此？ ）以及雅虎是个技术公司所带来的讽刺意味（他们不知道Skype是怎么做的吗？ 我认为梅耶的决定是正确的，我可以肯定，假以时日，经理就有批准其指令的例外情况的自由裁量权。 但是，到目前为止，在家工作的“权利”在雅虎仍是神圣不可侵犯的，是经理不可否决的雇员特权。 但是，据大家所说，雅虎有很多人根本不工作，不管是在家还是在更有意思的地方，这已经成了一个严重的问题。 除此之外，梅耶的禁令与其说是改善特定员工的生产率的方法，不如说是改变企业文化的手段。 远程办公很容易，正是因为如此，有工作场所比起集体在家办公 — — 或通过任务兔子（Task Rabbit）组织一组外包员工 — — 的优势在于在提供共同文化的地方一起办公能完成的工作更多，更能激发意外默契。 很久以前，企业的优势在于它能降低交易成本（第一个清晰阐述这一思想的是诺贝尔经济学奖获得者罗纳德·科斯 ） ， 即招聘员工、指派任务给员工、评估生产率、设定薪水等活动的成本。 如今，交易成本已经极低，上班工作的主要好处在于固定模式中的身体互动能激发组织文化和提升创造力，而不在于效率和生产率。 我认为，梅耶要其员工回到办公室的原因绝不仅仅是某些员工在家并不工作，而是许多工作的员工没有在一起工作。 诚然，对一些人来说，雅虎作为一个在线企业，要求其员工天天出现在办公室中有些奇怪。 但该行业的资金和人才都集中在美国从旧金山到圣何塞的一小块区域中。 不管是雅虎的自助餐厅（随着免费食物的出现变得更有吸引力也更繁忙）还是Plug & Play创业孵化大楼，面对面（proximity）至关重要。 上班出现在工作场所意味着与其他犀利而富于创造力的头脑的直接交流。 人际交流和互动的好处正是销售员仍在拜访客户，而不是使用Skype的原因，也是Meetup（支持组织者的面对面会议；我是该公司董事）能以Twitter和Facebook所不能的方式改变生活的原因。 当然，喜欢在家工作者的论据不仅包括沟通需要成本和时间，也包括会议滋生 — — 也许是太“多”的文化 — — 和稳定的过度沟通只能干扰其工作，而起不到促进作用。 有趣的是，我在泰国普吉岛WPP Stream“非会议 ” （ unconference）上听说了这一点，在那里，好几百人从千里之外飞来面对面分享关于强化工作关系的心得。 因此，在线工作确实在多种情形中作用多多，但当你试图修复破坏的公司文化时，你需要承诺、人力参与和创造性互动，而这只能在实体工作场所中才能坚持进行。 最后，优秀的经理会决定谁能在何处工作，并让会议变得简短有效。 事实上，之所以要有经理，全部原因在于他们能够执行裁决。 否则的话，计算机和互联网不但可以让我们在家办公，还能让我们向软件程序而不是活人报告。 但是，最终，挑战在于找到人与环境的正确契合点。 就个人而言，我是个反面范例。 作为非真正全日制工作者的独立天使投资人，我没有办公室，也不需每日报告。 但我会失去与周围人一起工作带来的交谊机会 — — 即便他们未必是我的同事。 幸运的是，Meetup让我能够与大约90人共济一堂；我做了长途旅行，但我在纽约市的“家”中可以随时随地出现在Meetup会议桌上。 诚然，我不必非得出席公司会议，但我喜欢周围都是忙人的感觉；我知道，这让我工作更加努力。 不管我们做什么工作，我们始终是社会生物。"

            "Yankee Bases Go Home RIO DE JANEIRO – Last month, the leaders of all 12 countries of South America (except one) gathered in Quito, Ecuador’s capital, for the summit of the Union of South American Nations. UNASUR or UNASUL (depending on whether one speaks Spanish or Portuguese) was established by the twelve presidents in Brasília in May 2008 with the aim of furthering economic and political integration. Instead, Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez hijacked the Quito meeting to propagate his Bolivarian Revolution and expound his own ideas for the continent’s future as independent of the United States. Thanks to America’s recently announced military agreement with Colombia, Chávez’s ideas got more of a hearing than might have been expected. For, instead of infrastructure plans, commercial or environmental treaties, or even multilateral action against such common problems as violence and poverty, the issue that dominated both press accounts and the speeches at the gathering was the new US-Colombian military agreement, announced less than a month before the summit. To no one’s surprise, Chávez dominated the criticism of the pact. He claimed that the “Winds of war are blowing,” and that the announcement of the military agreement “can transform itself into a tragedy.” Unfortunately, Colombian President Álvaro Uribe was absent from the meeting. Colombia and Ecuador broke diplomatic relations in March 2008, after Colombia’s army pursued FARC guerillas, who have been fighting Colombia’s government for decades, into Ecuadorean territory. So Uribe could not defend the new military agreement. This left the floor open to Chávez to isolate Colombia and preach against the US. In a continent where anti-Americanism remains both very popular and an effective way to consolidate national cohesion and political power, Chávez’s attacks found a ready audience. In addition, Uribe’s absence allowed Chávez to avoid responding to Colombia’s accusations that Venezuela and its ally Ecuador support the narco-Marxist FARC. One week after the summit, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton tried to calm the continent’s fears about the US-Colombia agreement, explaining that it is merely a minor revision of the Bill Clinton-era Plan Colombia, an American program to support the government against the drug cartels. But her words did little soothing. Nor did it seem to help that even most local military analysts say that the agreement does not represent any major change in the US military position on the continent. The simple fact is that the timing of the announcement of the pact was terrible, and gave a platform for Bolivarian rants that will not be without consequences. Indeed, the ongoing fallout is likely to remain very negative. By raising anti-American suspicions and strengthening Chávez’s position across the continent, the agreement weakens the influence of Brazil. Recently, Brazil had been differentiating itself from the rest of the continent through its stable economy and vibrant democratic political system, both of which were helping the country’s poor. So the spread and strengthening of Chávez’s so-called Bolivarian Revolution was not in Brazil’s interests, even though some of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva’s officials appear to be fans of Chávez and his administration. The terrible timing of the US-Colombia military agreement also gave Chávez and his allies a reason to build up their armies against the “evil imperialist ianque .” After all, one must remember, the Bolivarian Revolution’s supposed “enemy�� is the US, and no one else. So the agreement may legitimize and produce an arms race in South America, which is in no one’s interest. Another unexpected consequence of the US-Colombia military agreement may be a further heightening of tensions between Venezuela and Colombia. The radical polarization of the Andean region between those two countries will create difficulties in building regional consensus and security problems in the Amazon, as well as weakening the Brazilian project for South American political and economic integration. Finally, another major consequence of the US-Colombia deal are the doubts that it has created in Latin America about President Barack Obama’s administration, and about the future of relations between the US and South America, especially Brazil, the main regional power. The agreement revived the perception that US diplomacy lacks sensitivity where the region is concerned. If Obama wants to encourage moderate and democratic politics in South America, and to bolster Brazil’s efforts to foster stability and economic progress against the region’s radical and undemocratic forces, it must take greater care in not appearing to undermine those the US claims to support. For Chávez is showing that the old cry of “Yankee go home” still resonates.",
            "美军基地滚回去 里约热内卢 - - 上个月，南美全部十二个国家的领导人（除了一位）会聚厄瓜多尔首都基多举行“南美国家联盟 ” （ UNASUR）峰会。 UNASUR 或 UNASUL（缩写视西班牙语或葡萄牙语而定）是（南美）十二国总统于2008年五月在巴西利亚建立的，其宗旨是促进经济和政治一体化。 然而，委内瑞拉总统查韦斯却劫持了基多会议来宣扬其玻利维尔革命，并详细解释了他自己关于该大陆独立于美国的未来的理念。 由于美国最近宣布与哥伦比亚达成军事协定，查韦斯的声音得到了比预想更多的关注：因为媒体报道和峰会演讲中的主导性话题不是基础设施规划，商业或环境条约，甚至也不是应对暴力和贫困等共同问题的多边行动，而是在峰会前不到一个月时宣布的美国 - - 哥伦比亚新军事协定。 查韦斯毫无意外地发出了批评该协定的最强音。 他宣称“战争的风正在吹起 ” ， 军事协定的宣布“可能转化成一场悲剧 。 ” 不幸的是，哥伦比亚总统Álvaro Uribe没有出席会议。 在哥伦比亚军队追击FARC 游击队进入厄瓜多尔领土之后，两国于2008年三月断绝了外交关系。 该游击队已经与哥伦比亚政府对抗了数十年。 因此Uribe未能就新军事协议进行辩护。 这就给了查韦斯机会孤立哥伦比亚并高唱反美论调。 在这片反美情绪依然广泛，并能被用来有效地强化民族凝聚力和政治权力的大陆，查韦斯的攻击言论大有市场。 另外，Uribe的缺席使得查韦斯避免了回应哥伦比亚关于委内瑞拉和其盟国厄瓜多尔支持毒品马克思主义的FARC的指控。 在峰会后一周，美国国务卿希拉里·克林顿试图缓和南美诸国对美国 - - 哥伦比亚军事协议的恐惧。 她解释说这只不过是对克林顿时期《哥伦比亚计划》的微调而已。 美国的该项计划是为了支持哥政府对抗毒品卡特尔。 但她的解释没有令人放心。 即使大多数当地的军事分析家都认为该协议并不代表美国在该大陆军事立场的重大改变，但也于事无补。 事实非常简单，该协议宣布的时机太糟糕了。 它给了玻利瓦尔式“后果很严重” 的咆哮一个机会。 的确，这场未平的余波所带来的影响仍将是非常负面的。 由于激起了反美的怀疑情绪并强化了查韦斯在南美大陆的地位，该协议削弱了巴西的影响力。 最近，巴西因为稳定的经济和富有活力的政治体系而在南美独树一帜，而这两项都有利于该国的穷人。 所以，查韦斯所谓“玻利瓦尔革命”的推广和强化不符合巴西的利益。 尽管卢拉总统麾下的某些官员似乎是查韦斯及其政府的崇拜者。 美国 - - 哥伦比亚军事协议的糟糕时机还为查韦斯及其盟友壮大军力对抗“邪恶的帝国主义美国佬” 提供了理由。 毕竟，我们必须记住，玻利瓦尔革命的“假想敌”不是别人，正是美国。 因此这项协议可能在南美引发一场合法的军备竞赛，而这对于任何国家都是无益的。 美国 - - 哥伦比亚军事协议的另一个意想不到的后果可能是进一步加剧委内瑞拉和哥伦比亚之间的紧张关系。 两国之间的安第斯地区的激烈两极分化会给达成区域性共识和阿马逊地区的安全问题造成困难，同时还会削弱巴西在南美政治经济一体化中的努力。 最后，美国-哥伦比亚协定的另一个重大后果就是在拉美制造了对奥巴马政府和对美国和南美，特别是和地区大国巴西之间未来关系的怀疑。 该协议又印证了一种看法，即美国外交缺乏对该地区的敏感性。 如果奥巴马想要鼓励在南美实行温和与民主的政治，并支持巴西对抗该地区的激进和非民主力量，以实现稳定和经济进步的努力，他就必须倍加小心不要给人口蜜腹剑的印象。 因为查韦斯正让人意识到“美国佬滚回去”的经典呼号仍然回响在耳边。"

            "The Periphery’s Purgatory ATHENS – German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s upcoming visit to Athens will be a far less tense affair than her earlier journeys here during Europe’s long financial crisis. Of course, Greeks have little love for Merkel; but, thanks to Europe’s modest economic recovery, some of the poison has been drawn from Germany’s relations with Europe’s most damaged and distressed economies. Indeed, Europe is no longer considered a risk to global financial stability. The eurozone’s core economies are showing signs of revival, and financial conditions in the over-indebted periphery are improving as well. But, given capital shortages, depressed demand, and the slow pace of reform in the eurozone periphery, continued progress is far from certain. In the eurozone economies that were hit hardest by the global economic crisis, the output and employment losses have been huge and persistent. Real (inflation-adjusted) per capita income in the eurozone as a whole hovers around its 2007 level; in Greece and Italy, however, it has sunk to the levels recorded in 2000 and 1997, respectively. Meanwhile, the eurozone’s overall unemployment rate is 12%, and it is much higher in the periphery. In Spain, more than 25% of the labor force is jobless, while Italy’s youth unemployment rate stands at 42%. In Greece, where the overall unemployment rate has climbed to 28%, some 60% of the country’s young people are unemployed. Recovering from such crippling employment losses will not be easy, and will require a speedy return to high and sustainable growth rates. Consider Greece, where the government is planning a return to the capital markets in the coming months to finance the country’s long-term borrowing needs, even though securing such financing would require paying unsustainably high interest rates. The fact that the government seems willing to do so translates clearly its desire to move beyond the influence of the “troika” (the International Monetary Fund, the European Commission, and the European Central Bank). Indeed, since 2008, Greece’s GDP has shrunk by almost 25%. Recovering lost capacity will require large amounts of capital, but there are five reasons why such financing is unlikely, under present conditions, to be forthcoming: · As a result of austerity, public investment as a share of GDP continues to fall and has now reached a record low. Having already committed substantial rescue funds, eurozone authorities do not seem inclined to inject fresh capital. · Sources of domestic private capital are limited, because the recession and the related near-collapse of asset prices, along with a sharp increase in taxation – particularly on high incomes and on capital – significantly weakened balance sheets. · Bank lending has slowed drastically, as a result of Greek banks effectively defaulting in the wake of the troika-imposed losses on sovereign creditors and the nationalization of the country’s banks. A record-low level of deposits and the recession-related rise of non-performing loans have weakened Greek banks’ capital position further. (Today, companies in the eurozone periphery borrow at substantially higher rates than their counterparts in the core. For bank loans, the ratio is almost two to one; for long-term financing, it may reach as high as ten to one.) · Greece’s unsustainable debt position is discouraging foreign private investment. The assumptions about primary surpluses, private-sector involvement, and GDP growth underlying the government’s commitment to reduce its debt level, which currently exceeds 170% of GDP, to 124% of GDP by 2020 cannot be realized, given Germany’s opposition to restructuring the official financing that replaced the defaulted private loans. Some easing of loan conditionality – via extended maturities and reduced interest rates ‒ will be agreed later this year, but it will not be enough to calm fears of a new default. · Trust between foreign and Greek investors is lacking, and it will not be restored until debt sustainability is achieved. But Germany and the other core eurozone countries consistently block any proposal that contemplates debt mutualization or fiscal union. Ideas such as Eurobonds, a single European finance ministry, and increased capitalization of Europe’s common rescue funds (the European Stability Mechanism and the Single Resolution Mechanism) are not even being contemplated. Along with inadequate capital supply, Greece is suffering from a demand shortfall, as the troika continues to squeeze the country with harsh austerity. If these policies are not relaxed or offset by more expansionary policies in the eurozone core, demand will remain depressed, discouraging further investment. Finally, on the reform front, time is running out. For the last few years, rather than confronting the special interests – state-protected businesses, public-sector trade unions, and lobbies – that inhibit reform, Greece has spread its economic misery horizontally through blanket spending cuts. Reforms such as privatizing state-owned enterprises, opening up closed professions, abolishing restrictive business practices, and reducing the size of the public sector have been undertaken very slowly and inefficiently, and they will not significantly alter growth prospects. As it stands, Greece is unlikely to meet the recovery challenge – and other peripheral economies will probably falter, too. Sufficient reforms and capital are lacking, while the social rifts resulting from austerity increase the risk of potentially devastating political instability. With the European Parliament election approaching, the prospect of populist anti-austerity parties prevailing in the periphery – and of anti-euro, anti-bailout parties gaining power in the core – heightens the risk of instability even more. Should financial turbulence return and herald a new eurozone crisis, the monetary union’s sustainability will again be called into question. To prevent this outcome, Greece and the eurozone’s other peripheral economies must limit austerity, buttress demand, undertake reform, increase investment support, and pursue fiscal union. Unfortunately, these keys to ensuring a cohesive and prosperous eurozone are likely to be left unturned – until, perhaps, the next crisis occurs.",
            "外围国的炼狱 雅典—德国总理默克尔即将访问雅典，此次访问所引起的紧张远远比不上她在欧洲长期金融危机期间来访时。 当然，希腊人并不喜欢默克尔；但是，感谢欧洲经济的缓慢复苏，德国与欧洲受伤最深经济体之间的关系也有所缓和。 事实上，欧洲已不再被视为全球金融稳定的风险因素。 欧元区核心经济体正在显示出恢复迹象，过度负债的外围的金融状况也在改善。 但是，由于存在资本短缺、需求受抑以及欧元区外围改革进展缓慢，进展能否保持还远未可知。 在受全球经济危机冲击最大的欧元区经济体，产出和就业损失巨大而持久。 欧元区整体实际（经通胀调整的）人均收入在2007年水平徘徊；希腊和意大利分别下降到2000年和1997年水平。 与此同时，欧元区整体失业率高达12 % ， 外围更是远远高于这个数字。 在西班牙，超过25%的劳动力没有工作，意大利的年轻人失业率高达42 % 。 在希腊，总体失业率升高至28 % ， 更有60%左右的年轻人没有工作。 从如此惨重的就业损失中恢复决非易事，并且需要快速恢复可持续的高增长率。 以希腊为例，希腊政府计划在未来几个月回到资本市场为其长期借款需要融资，尽管确保融资需要付出不可持续的高利率。 希腊政府决心这样做这一事实清楚地表明他渴望摆脱“三驾马车（国际货币基金组织、欧盟委员会和欧洲央行）的影响。 事实上，自2008年以来，希腊GDP收缩了近25 % 。 恢复失去的产能需要大量资本，但出于五个理由，希腊无法在当前条件下迅速获得融资： · 拜紧缩所赐，公共投资占GDP之比一直在下降，现已降至创纪录的低位。 已经承诺给出大量援助资金的欧元区当局似乎不再愿意注入新资本。 · 国内私人资本十分有限，因为衰退和近乎崩溃的资产价格加上税收的急剧增加 — — 特别是对高收入和资本的税收 — — 极大地破坏了资产负债表。 · 银行贷款急剧放慢，因为希腊银行已经事实违约，而违约原因是三驾马车给主权债权人强加的损失以及希腊银行的国有化。 创纪录的低存款和拜衰退所赐的不良贷款增加进一步削弱了希腊银行的资本充足度。 （如今，欧元区外围国政府的借款利率显著高于核心国。 对银行贷款来说，比例为2比1；对长期融资来说，比例可能高达10比1 ） 。 · 希腊不可持续的债务状况让外国私人投资打起了退堂鼓。 初级盈余、私人部门参与、以及政府降低债务水平承诺所需要的GDP增长水平（目前的债务水平位GDP的170%多，到2020年应降低至124 % ） 等方面的目标不可能实现，因为德国反对重组取代违约私人贷款的官方融资。 今年晚些时候将达成一致放松一些贷款条件（通过延长期限和降低利率 ） ， 但不足以平息对新一轮违约的担心。 · 希腊和外国投资者之间缺乏信任，并且在实现债务可持续之前，信任无法重塑。 但德国和其他欧元区核心国家一致地阻挠任何考虑债务共同化��财政联盟的方案。 欧元债券、单一欧洲财政部和增加欧洲共同援助资金（欧洲稳定性机制（European Stability Mechanism）和单一清算机制（Single Resolution Mechanism ） ） 等方案更是想都不用想。 除了资本供应不足，希腊还饱受需求短缺折磨，因为三驾马车一直在用严厉的紧缩挤压希腊。 如果这些政策不放松，或没有欧元区核心国的宽松政策抵消其影响，则需求将继续受到抑制，从而抑制后续投资。 最后，在改革问题上，时间正在耗尽。 过去几年来，希腊并没有直面阻挠改革的特殊利益 — — 国家保护企业、公共部门工会和游说集团，而是用一刀切的减支推广了经济痛苦。 私有化国有企业、开放封闭的行业、废除限制商业的行为、收缩公共部门规模等改革进展极慢、效率极低，也无法极大地改变增长前景。 就目前而言，希腊无法应对复苏挑战 — — 其他外围经济体亦然。 它们缺少充分的改革和资本，而紧缩带来的社会分裂增加了爆发灾难性政治动荡的风险。 欧洲议会近在咫尺，民粹主义反紧缩政党在外围国大有夺权之势 — — 而反欧元、反援助政党则极有可能在核心国掌权 — — 发生动荡的可能性进一步增加了。 如果金融动荡回归并且预示着新的欧元区危机，那么这一货币联盟的可持续性将再次产生疑问。 为了防止这一结果，希腊和欧元区其他外围经济体必须限制紧缩、巩固需求、实施改革、增加投资支持并追求财政联盟。 不幸的是，这些确保团结、繁荣的欧元区的关键都不太可能取得突破 — — 也许要靠另一场危机的发生才行。"

            "China’s Singapore Swing BEIJING – The Chinese Communist Party has released the final document of the Third Plenum of the 18th Central Committee. In the CCP’s history, the third plenum has traditionally been the occasion for the party to announce its major policies for the next 5-10 years. This year happened to be one of leadership transition, so the third plenum became more important. As expected, its final document unveils a plan for comprehensive reforms that will reshape China’s economy and society in the next decade. For starters, the household registration (hukou) system will be reformed. Small cities and towns will allow migrants to apply for the local hukou with no strings attached, and medium-size cities will do the same, with some restrictions. Although large cities will remain as closed as ever, the new policy will dramatically weaken the institutional foundation of China’s long history of urban-rural and regional divides. Similarly, the one-child policy that has been enforced for the last 34 years will be modified. In most provinces, parents who are both single children themselves already can have two children. The new policy recommends that provinces allow couples to have two children if either parent is a single child. While this will affect only around 10 million couples – a small number in a country of more than 1.3 billion people – the reform represents a gigantic step toward ending the one-child rule. Farmers, moreover, will be granted the right to sell their residential land on the open market and will be much more likely to be compensated at market rates when their land is taken by the government. State-owned enterprises (SOEs), meanwhile, are expected to surrender more of their profits to the government – up to 30% by 2020. This extra revenue will be used to finance China’s social-security system. Indeed, from now on, the central government will take over social-security expenditure, establishing nationally unified pension and health-insurance systems, while the retirement age will be raised gradually. Currently, women can retire at the age of 50, and men at 55 – ridiculously low by global standards and clearly unsustainable, given China’s rapidly aging population. SOEs’ power will be curtailed in other ways. Their ability to stifle innovation will be weakened by a drastic reduction in the government’s power to restrict the entry of new competitors into all areas of the economy, as well as a major effort to reduce bureaucratic red tape. Financial liberalization, too, will be deepened, which will help startups and private firms most of all. In addition to pledging to liberalize exchange and interest rates, the final document also calls for allowing domestic private capital to form small and medium-size banks. And, in an effort to bring coherence to commercial courts’ rulings, the court system will be directly financed by the central government, rather than by the corresponding local government. This promises to strengthen the independence of the court system at the local level. All of these reforms have long been expected. But the third plenum also provided surprises, including the creation of a leading group within the CCP to steer reform. China used to have a reform commission within the executive branch; the establishment of the leading group indicates the CCP’s commitment, and that of President Xi Jinping, to comprehensive reform. A second surprise is the document’s emphasis on the market. In the past, government direction was emphasized, despite an acknowledgement of the market’s positive role. Now, for the first time, the CCP is officially calling for “allowing the market to take a central role in resource allocation.” A final surprise is that the document sets a timeframe to complete all of the reforms; by 2020, China is supposed to become a full-fledged market economy. This is the first time in recent history that the CCP has set a specific deadline for policymaking. And yet, while all of these measures are encouraging signs, some key items are missing. For example, there was no clear mention of further SOE reform. Likewise, though the document calls for strengthening local legislatures, it proposes no concrete plan to curb local governments’ role in economic activities, which is one of the sources of distortions in the Chinese economy. This is related to the final document’s most significant lacuna: political reform. In fact, a Singapore-style approach – combining a freewheeling market economy and an authoritarian regime – has clearly emerged from the plenum. It is an approach that awaits the test of time. Singapore is a city-state of five million people – roughly the population of the Haidian district of Beijing. Given China’s much greater size and complexity, the Chinese government’s pursuit of the Singaporean model, with its suppression of any and all social disorder, would ultimately undermine economic dynamism. To build the innovative economy envisioned by the third plenum, the CCP’s leadership needs to find a new governance model that fosters a vibrant society. Sooner rather than later, the crucially important economic reforms that have just been unveiled will not be enough.",
            "中国转向新加坡 北京—中共公布了十八大三中全会的最终文件。 从历史上看，中共往往在三中全会上公布未来五到十年的重大政策。 今年恰逢领导层过渡之年，因此三中全会也变得更加重要。 如人们所期望的，此次三中全会的最终文件揭开了将决定未来十年中国经济和社会面貌的全面的改革计划。 首先，户口制度将得到改革。 小城市和建制镇将放开农民工落户申请，不再附带条件；中等城市也将如此，但会有一些限制。 尽管大城市的大门仍如以往那样关闭着，但这一新政策将极大地削弱中国长期的城乡和地区差距的制度性基础。 类似地，强制执行了34年的独生子女政策也将修改。 在大部分省份，双方本身都是独生子女的父母已经可以生育二胎。 新政策建议各省允许任一方为独生子女的父母生育二胎。 这项政策大概只能影响1000万对夫妻 — — 对于人口超过13亿的中国来说，这个数字只是九牛一毛 — — 但它代表了迈向结束独生子女规则的巨大一步。 此外，农民将获得在公开市场上出售宅基地的权利，并大大提高他们在土地被政府征用时以市场价格获得补偿的机会。 与此同时，国有企业将把更多的利润上缴给政府 — — 到2020年上缴比例最高将达到30 % 。 这一额外的收入将用于充实社会保障系统。 事实上，从现在开始，中央政府将接管社会保障支出，成立全国统一的养老金和医疗保险系统，同时退休年龄将逐渐提高。 目前，女性退休年龄是50岁，男性是55岁 — — 以全球标准来看显然过低，且考虑到中国人口迅速老龄化的趋势，这显然是不可持续的。 国有企业的权力还将受到其他方式的削弱。 政府限制新竞争者进入经济各个领域的权力将大大受限，官僚主义繁文缛节也将遭到大力削弱，这将极大地降低国有企业对创新的制约作用。 金融自由化也将得到深化，受益最大的将是创业企业和民营企业。 除了承诺汇率和利率自由化外，三中全会最终文件还要求允许国内民间资本组建中小型银行。 此外，为了保证商业法庭裁决的一致性，法院系统将直接由中央政府而不是对应的地方政府提供资金。 这将有利于增强地方层面法院系统的独立性。 所有这些改革都是人们所长期期待的。 但此次三中全会还带来了惊喜，包括在党内成立全面深化改革领导小组。 中国的行政部门体系中已经有了发改委；领导小组的成立彰显出中共和习近平主席对全面改革的决心。 第二个惊喜是文件对市场的强调。 过去尽管也承认市场的积极作用，但总是强调政府导向。 如今，中共首次正式要求“使市场在资源配置中起决定性作用 ” 。 最后一个惊喜是为完成全部改革制定了时间表；中国准备在2020年建成成熟的市场经济。 这是中共在最近一段时期首次为政策制定设置具体的期限。 但是，尽管所有这些措施都是令人鼓舞的信号，也有一些关键点没有触及。 比如，文件没有明确提出进一步改革国有企业。 类似地，尽管文件要求加强地方立法机构，但并没有拿出具体的计划限制地方政府在经济活动中的角色，而这是中国经济扭曲的来源之一。 这与最终文件最重要的空白有关：政治改革。 事实上，三中全会显然决定采取新加坡式的方针 — — 自由市场经济和专制政权相结合。 这一方针有待时间的检验。 新加坡是一个城市国家，只有500万人口 — — 大概和北京市海淀区相当。 中国的规模和复杂性远甚于新加坡，因此中国政府追求新加坡模式以及对一切社会动荡采取高压手段最终会破坏经济活力。 为了建设三中全会提出的创新型经济，中共领导层需要找到能培养有活力的社会的新的治理模式。 很快，刚刚展开的具有关键重要性的经济改革便会显得后劲不足。"

            "China’s Real-Estate Wrongs BEIJING – China’s real-estate sector has been a source of serious concern for several years, with soaring property prices raising fears of overheating in the housing market. But, with price growth easing, it seems that the government’s campaign to rein in property risk is finally taking hold. The danger now is that the housing market will collapse – bringing China’s economic prospects down with it. In its effort to control rising housing prices, China’s government has pursued nine distinct policies, not all of which have served their purpose. Though policies like limits on mortgages for first-time buyers and minimum residency requirements for purchasing property in a first-tier city like Beijing or Shanghai helped to ease demand, supply-side tactics, such as limiting credit to real-estate developers and imposing new taxes on property sales, have proved to be counter-productive. This flawed approach allowed China’s housing prices to continue to rise steadily, fueling major housing bubbles, especially in first-tier cities. The average Beijing resident would have to save all of his or her income for 34 years before to be able to purchase an apartment outright. In Shanghai and Guangzhou, the equivalent is 29 and 27 years, respectively – much higher than in other major international cities. The expectation that this trend will continue has driven homeowners to retain possession of their properties, even though rental rates amount to less than 2% of a property’s market value. But, with the real-estate sector finally facing a downturn, the time to rethink this investment strategy has arrived. In the first four months of 2014, housing sales dropped by nearly 7% year on year, with construction of new floor area falling by more than 22%. As a result, downward pressure on property prices is mounting. In normal times, citizens and officials alike would welcome this trend. But, at a time of weakening economic performance, China cannot afford an implosion of the real-estate sector, which accounts for at least 30% of overall growth. Indeed, though China’s government has expressed its willingness to sacrifice some growth in its pursuit of structural reform and rebalancing, the impact of a housing-market collapse on the financial sector would cause growth to slow beyond the acceptable limit. That impact partly reflects the highly problematic nature of the Chinese government’s long-awaited move to liberalize interest rates. Instead of taking a direct approach – lifting the interest-rate cap imposed on banks – liberalization has been achieved by allowing shadow banking to flourish. As a result, a large number of nonbank financial institutions – such as wealth-management companies and online financial-services providers – are now using promises of high returns to attract small investors. Making matters worse, the monetary authorities have tightened the credit supply, in an effort to deleverage the Chinese economy. While both interest-rate liberalization and deleveraging are critical to the long-term health of China’s economy, the skyrocketing cost of borrowing is forcing many low-risk companies, which are unable to offer sufficiently high rates of return, out of the market. At the same time, real-estate developers who have borrowed heavily from shadow-banking institutions, based on the assumption that property prices would continue to rise steadily, may struggle to repay their debts, with a sharp decline in prices inevitably leading to defaults. Given that the formal banking sector provides a large share of shadow-banking finance, this could initiate a chain reaction affecting the entire financial sector. Many remain convinced that China’s government – which wields with the world’s largest foreign-exchange reserves and virtually unchecked authority – would be able to prevent a major financial crisis. But the financial crisis in the fast-growing city of Wenzhou, triggered by bad loans, suggests otherwise – not least because the economy has yet to recover fully. There is no reason to believe that a similar crisis could not occur on a national scale. To avoid such an outcome, China’s leaders must urgently adopt counter-cyclical measures. They should begin by eliminating non-market-based restrictions on the real-estate sector, which have generated serious distortions not only to the economy, but also to people’s lives, with couples divorcing temporarily to gain the right to purchase an additional apartment. When it comes to the real-estate sector, China’s government has consistently had the right objective and the wrong strategy. It is time to align intention with action. Otherwise, China’s financial sector – indeed, its entire economy – will suffer.",
            "中国的房地产问题 北京—几年来，中国的房地产业已成为一个严重忧虑，一飞冲天的房地产价格让人们担心住房市场存在过热。 但是，随着价格涨势的减缓，政府遏制房地产风险的举措似乎终于见效了。 现在的危险是住房市场可能崩溃，并将中国经济前景也拖下水。 为了控制房价上涨，中国政府采取了九项不同政策，但并非每一项政策都达到了效果。 尽管将按揭限定于首次购房者、北京和上海等一线城市要求达到最低定居时限才能买房等政策有助于遏制需求，但供给端的策略，如限制房地产开发商信贷、实施新房销售税等，效果适得其反。 这一存在缺陷的方针让中国房价继续稳步上升，催生了巨大的住房泡沫，特别是在一线城市。 普通北京居民需要将收入不吃不喝存34年才能全款购买一套公寓。 上海和广州则分别为29年和27年 — — 远远高于其他国际大城市。 预期这一趋势还会持续让业主继续持有自己的房产，即便房租率只相当于房产市值的不到2 % 。 但是，随着房地产业最终开始面临下降趋势，反思这一投资战略的时间也已到来。 2014年前四个月，住房销售同比下降近7 % ， 新建楼面面积下降22%以上。 照此看，房价下跌压力正在积聚。 在正常时期，公民和官员都会欢迎这一趋势。 但是，在经济表现不力的时候，中国无法承担至少贡献了增长总量30%的房地产业崩溃。 事实上，尽管中国政府表示愿意为结构改革和再平衡牺牲一些增长，但住房市场崩溃对金融业的冲击会导致增长下降至远低于可接受下限的水平。 这一冲击部分反映了人们期待已久的中国政府放松利率管制的政策有很大问题。 利率自由化并没有采取直接方式 — — 提高银行利率上限 — — 而是通过允许影子银行兴盛的方式实现。 结果，如今大量非银行金融机构 — — 如理财公司和在线金融服务商 — — 以高回报承诺吸引小投资者。 更糟糕的是，货币当局收紧了信用供给以促进中国经济去杠杆化。 尽管利率自由化和去杠杆化对中国经济的长期健康至关重要，但高企的借贷成本迫使许多低风险公司因为无法提供足够高的回报率而被挤出市场。 与此同时，认为房价将继续稳步上升而大量从影子银行机构举债房地产开发商可能难以偿还债务，价格的急剧下跌将不可避免地导致违约。 考虑到影子银行金融的很大一部分资金来自正式银行部门，这可能导致影响整个金融业的连锁反应。 许多人仍认为坐拥世界第一大规模外汇储备、拥有几乎无限权力的中国政府能够避免重大金融危机。 但高增长城市温州因为坏账而发生了金融危机，这表明上述观点未必正确 — — 因为经济尚未完全复苏。 没有理由认为类似的危机不可能在全国���围内发生。 为了避免这样的结果，中国领导人必须紧急采取反周期措施。 他们应该从取消房地产业的非市场限制开始，这些限制所造成的严重扭曲不但影响了经济，也影响了人民的生活，许多人不惜假离婚以获得购买第二套公寓的权利。 在房地产业的问题上，中国政府一直在用错误的战略追求正确的目标。 目的和行动之间应该一致。 否则，中国的金融业 — — 事实上，是整个经济 — — 都要遭殃。"

            "In Praise of China’s New Normal BEIJING – China’s economy is, at long last, undergoing a rebalancing, with growth rates having declined from more than 10% before 2008 to roughly 7.5% today. Is this China’s “new normal,” or should the country anticipate even slower growth in the coming decade? China’s rebalancing is apparent, first and foremost, in the export sector. Export growth has slowed from its 2001-2008 average of 29% annually to below 10%, making foreign demand a far less critical engine of growth. Moreover, manufacturing employment and output, as a share of the total, began to decline last year. In fact, in the first half of this year, services accounted for more than half of total economic growth. It is no surprise, then, that China’s current-account surplus has shrunk rapidly, from its 2007 peak of more than 10% of GDP to about 2% of GDP today. This rebalancing has helped to improve China’s income distribution. Indeed, in recent years, labor’s share of national income has been on the rise – a direct reflection of the decline in manufacturing and expansion in services. That has meant greater regional balance as well: The coastal provinces, which produce more than 85% of the country’s exports, are experiencing the most pronounced slowdown, while inland provinces have maintained relatively high growth rates. As a result, China’s Gini coefficient (a 100-point index of inequality, in which zero signifies absolute equality and one absolute inequality) fell to 0.50 in 2012, from 0.52 in 2010. Two principal factors are driving this shift. The first is the decline in global demand in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, which has forced China to adjust its growth model sooner than anticipated. The second is China’s ongoing demographic transformation. The share of working-age people (16-65 years old) in the total population has been declining since its 2010 peak of 72%. And the absolute number of working-age people has been falling since 2012. At the same time, China is undergoing rapid urbanization, with some 200 million people having left the agricultural sector in 2001-2008 to seek urban manufacturing jobs. More recently, however, the pace of migration has slowed substantially, with rural areas retaining 35% of China’s total labor force. All of this implies lower growth rates for China – though perhaps not as low as the 6-7% rates that economists like Liu Shijing and Cai Fang are predicting for the next decade. In fact, relying on China’s past growth record to predict future performance is inherently problematic, owing not only to important shifts in the labor force, but also to the fact that the speed and scale of China’s pre-2008 growth was unprecedented. For starters, it is likely that the contribution to output growth of the rising ratio of working-age people prior to 2010 was overestimated. That makes the subsequent decline in the ratio an inaccurate measure with which to determine the negative impact on economic performance. Moreover, this approach neglects the educational dividends that China will enjoy over the next 20 years, as the younger generation replaces older workers. As it stands, the rate of return-adjusted educational attainment for Chinese aged 50-60 is half that of those aged 20-25. In other words, young workers will be twice as productive as those entering retirement. Indeed, the level of educational attainment in China continues to improve. By 2020, the share of those aged 18-22 who are pursuing a college education will reach 40%, compared to 32% today. This improvement in human capital is bound to offset, to some extent, the net loss of labor. Furthermore, China’s low retirement age – 50 for women and 60 for men – provides policymakers with considerable room to maneuver. Increasing the retirement age by just a half-year for each of the next ten years would more than compensate for the annual decline in the labor force, which is projected to be 2.5 million workers during this period. Other trends are boosting China’s prospects further. Though investment is likely to decline as a share of GDP, it will probably take a decade for it to dip below 40% – still robust by international standards. Meanwhile, the capital stock can maintain a reasonable growth rate. Finally, China’s capacity for innovation is improving steadily, owing to rapidly increasing human capital and rising investment in research and development. By next year, Chinese R&D expenditure, at 2.2% of GDP, will be closing in on advanced-country levels. Based on these trends – and assuming a constant labor-participation rate – China’s potential growth rate over the next decade is likely to hover around 6.9-7.6%, averaging 7.27%. This may be much lower than the 9.4% average growth rate in 1988-2013, but it is more than adequate by global standards. If this is China’s “new normal,” it would still be the envy of the rest of the world.",
            "为中国的新常态欢呼 发自北京 — — 在经过了漫长的等待之后，中国经济终于启动了结构再平衡进程，增长率也从2008年以前的超过10%下降到如今的约7.5 % 。 这是否就是中国的“新常态 ” ， 还是这个国家预期在未来十年内会出现更低的增长？ 首先，中国经济在出口部门方面的再平衡是显而易见的。 出口增长从2001~2008年间的年均29%下降到低于10 % ， 使得国外需求作为增长引擎的作用不再如此重要。 此外，制造业就业和产出占总体的比重在去年开始下降。 在今年上半年，服务业占据了总体经济增长的超过一半。 因此中国的经常账户顺差从2007年占GDP超过10%的顶峰迅速下跌如今大概2%的情况也就不出所料了， 这一再平衡帮助改善了中国的收入分配状况。 事实上近年来劳动工资收入在国民收入中的比重有所上升 — — 这也直接反映出制造业的收缩和服务业的扩大。 这同时也意味着更深层次的区域性再平衡状况：占中国出口总量超过85%的沿海省份正经历着最为显著的放缓过程，而内陆省份则维持着较高的增长率。 在这样的形势下中国的基尼系数（定量测定收入分配差异程度的指数，其值在0和1之间，0表示收入分配极端平等而1表示极端不平等）从2012年的0.52下跌到了2012年的0.5。 推动这一转变的是两大基本因素。 其一是2008年金融危机以来全球需求下降，迫使中国提前开始调整自身增长模式。 其二则是中国人口结构的不断转变。 处于16~65岁之间的劳动人口占总人口的比例自2010年达到最高72%后逐年下降。 而劳动人口的绝对数量也自2012年后不断减少。 与此同时，中国正处于高速城市化进程之中，在2001~2008年间有约200万人脱离农业寻找城市制造业工作。 但近年以来这一移民进程持续放缓，而农村地区则吸收了全国劳动者总数的35 % 。 所有这些都体现出中国更低的增长率 — — 虽然可能不会像经济学家刘世锦，蔡方所预计的那样低到6~7 % 。 事实上，依靠中国过去的增长记录去预测未来的经济表现显然是站不住脚的，不仅仅是因为劳动人口方面的重大转换，还必须认识到中国在2008年之前的发展速度和规模都是前所未有的。 首先，在2010年以前劳动人口数量增长率对生产增长的贡献很可能被高估了。 这使得随后该比率的下跌成为了测定经济负面影响的一个不准确手段。 此外，这一手段忽视了中国在未来20年间享受的教育红利，因为新一代劳动者正不断取代老一辈。 按照这一情况，50~60岁年龄段中国人的收入/受教育程度比率只有20~25岁年龄段的一半，换句话说，新一代劳动者的生产力将是临近退休者的一倍。 事实上，中国国民的教育水平正不断提升。 到2020年，在大学求学的18~22岁青年将占到该年龄段总人口的40 % ， 而目前为32 % 。 这种人力资本的提升将在一定程度上补偿劳动力的净流失。 与此同时，中国的低退休年龄 — — 女性50岁和/男性60岁 — — 为政策制定者们提供了相当大的回旋余地。 只需在未来每十年将退休年龄提高半年就足以补偿每年约250万劳动力的流失。 还有另一个趋势在进一步推动中国的繁荣。 虽然投资占GDP的比重不断降低，但可能需要十年的时间才能降到低于40 % — —按照国际标准来说这一比率依然较高。 同时资本存量也会维持较高的增长率。 最后，因为人力资本迅速增加和研究投资的不断增长，中国的创新能力正在稳步提升。 明年中国的研究支出将相当于GDP的2.2 % ， 接近发达国家的水平。 基于这些趋势 — — 并假设一个持续的劳动参与率 — — 中国在未来10年的潜在增长率将在6.9~7.6之间波动，平均为7.27 % 。 这个数字或许比1988~2013年间的年均9.4%低得多，但相对于全球标准来说这已经足够了。 如果这就是中国的“新常态 ” ， 那么依然会是个令全世界羡慕不已的状况。"

            "China’s Shadow Menace BEIJING – The US Federal Reserve’s decision to exit from so-called “quantitative easing” – its massive monthly purchases of long-term assets – is stoking fears of a hard economic landing in China. But China’s strong economic fundamentals mean that policymakers have the space to avoid such an outcome – as long as they bring the country’s shadow banking system under control. As it stands, Chinese consumption and investment growth is expected to remain at roughly last year’s levels. Meanwhile, economic recovery in the advanced economies, especially the United States and Europe, is reinvigorating external demand, leading analysts to project annual Chinese export growth of more than 10% this year – 3-4 percentage points higher than in 2013. This would bring annual GDP growth in 2014 to a very healthy 7.5-8%. The problem is that China’s financial sector has accumulated considerable risk in recent years, with broad money (M2) having ballooned to ¥110.7 trillion ($18 trillion) – almost twice the country’s GDP – at the end of last year. In an attempt to rein in M2, which could indicate that the economy is overleveraged, the central bank tightened conditions for commercial bank lending, so that, for any given increase in M2, less credit is extended. But the move failed to contain M2 growth; on the contrary, M2 grew faster last year than in 2012. Worse, restricting commercial banks’ role as financial intermediaries and encouraging the growth of unregulated shadow banking has generated even more risks for China’s economy. Clearly, a new approach is needed – one that is based on a deeper understanding of the dangers inherent in China’s banking system. While it is true that surging M2 can reflect excessive leverage, it is not a particularly accurate gauge in China, where commercial banks can easily circumvent high reserve requirements and quantitative controls by moving loans off their balance sheets to wealth-management products – practices that fuel artificial credit expansion that looks like M2 growth. In this sense, it is the Chinese monetary authorities’ reluctance to open up the formal financial sector to domestic private capital, or to liberalize the deposit rate, that is fueling the expansion of shadow banking. With small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) – by far the economy’s most important growth engine – unable to acquire sufficient funding from the formal financial sector, they have been forced to turn to informal channels. As shadow banking has become the primary source of finance for SMEs – which tend to be higher-risk borrowers – the financial risks in China’s economy have grown exponentially. Exacerbating matters, the central bank’s repeated efforts to tighten the money supply raises the cost of capital. Last June, the annualized interbank lending rate surged to more than 10% – a level that it almost matched in December. SMEs ultimately shoulder these costs, diminishing their ability to contribute to overall economic growth. Consider the Internet giant Alibaba, which began using Zhi-fu-bao, the Chinese equivalent of PayPal, to raise money last year. In just a few months, it received ¥400 billion from 85 million small investors. Tencent, China’s largest Internet company, is now using the same strategy to compete with Alibaba, with both companies offering high rates of return – often 6-7% annually – to attract as many investors as possible. The problem is that most of this investment is in the interbank market, meaning that SMEs ultimately face interest rates of more than 10% – and that does not include the added 3% for SMEs’ loan guarantees. These unsustainable high rates are transmitting major risks to the real economy. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the real-estate sector. Liquidity-thirsty developers, unable to acquire financing through the formal banking sector, have been taking out massive loans at extremely high interest rates. But, in many cases, housing demand has not grown as expected, raising the risk of default – the effects of which would be transmitted to the entire financial sector. The fact is that China has never been closer to a major financial crisis than it is today. Yet China’s monetary authorities do not seem to understand the scale of the risk – or its root causes. The Chinese economy may well need to be deleveraged. But, instead of blindly tightening the credit supply, policymakers must pursue deep financial-sector reform to liberalize the deposit rate, eliminate quantitative controls, and, most important, allow for the establishment of domestic private financial institutions. Pursuing this agenda is essential to China’s long-term financial and economic health. But doing so presupposes a major shift in Chinese monetary authorities’ mindset. Therein lies the real challenge facing China today.",
            "中国的影子威胁 北京—美联储退出所谓”量化宽松 ” （ 大规模月度长期资产购买）的决定正在引起关于中国经济硬着陆的恐慌。 但中国强大的经济基本面意味着决策者有空间避免这一结果 — — 只要他们能将中国的影子银行系统控制住。 目前，中国消费和投资增长预计将维持与去年相当的水平。 与此同时，发达经济体（特别是美国和欧洲）的经济复苏正在重新刺激外需，这让分析师们预测今年中国出口年怎张率将超过10 % ， 比2013年高3—4个百分点。 这将让2014年GDP增长率达到相当健康的7.5—8 % 。 问题在于，近几年来中国金融部门累积了大量风险，到去年年底，广义货币（M2）总量膨胀到110.7万亿元，接近GDP的两倍。 为了遏制M2 — — 该指标表明中国经济有杠杆过高之嫌 — — 中国人民银行收紧了商业银行贷款标准，因此，对于任何给定的M2增量，信用增量下降了。 但这一措施并未遏制M2的增长；相反，去年M2增长比2012年更快。 更糟糕的是，限制商业银行作为金融媒介的角色、鼓励不受监管的影子银行的增长已经给中国经济带来了更大的风险。 显然，中国需要新方针 — — 基于对中国银行体系内部风险更深认识的方针。 诚然，M2的飙涨可能反映了过高的杠杆，但这在中国并不是一个特别准确标尺。 中国的商业银行可以轻松地规避高储备金要求和量化控制手段，只要将它们的贷款从资产负债表移到理财产品即可 — — 如此形成的人为信用扩张与M2增长十分接近。 照此看，助长影子银行扩张的恰恰是中国货币当局不愿向国内私人资本放开正式银行部门和实施存款利率自由化。 中小企业 — — 目前它们是中国经济最重要的增长引擎 — — 无法通过正式金融部门获得足够的融资，被迫转向非正式渠道。 随着影子银行变成中小企业的主要融资源 — — 而中小企业总是风险较高的借款人 — — 中国经济的金融风险呈现出指数增长。 雪上加霜的是，中国人民银行一再收紧货币供给，从而提高了资本成本。 去年6月，年化银行间拆借利率飙升到10%以上，12月又几乎重演了一次。 中小企业是这一成本的最终承担者，它们对总体经济增长的贡献能力也因此受到了制约。 以互联网巨头阿里巴巴为例。 去年，阿里巴巴开始利用支付宝融资。 不出几个月，支付宝就收到了来自8,500万小投资者的4,000亿元资金。 中国最大的互联万公司腾讯公司现在正在用同样的战略与阿里巴巴竞争。 不管是腾讯还是阿里巴巴，都给出了相当高的回报率 — — 年化水平通常可达6—7 % — —来吸引尽可能多的投资者。 问题在于这些投资的主要去向正是银行间市场，这意味着中小企业最终面临超过10%的利率 — — 还不包括3%的额外的中小企业贷款担保。 这一不可持续的高利率正在把巨大的风险转移给实体经济。 最能说明这一问题的莫过于房地产业了。 急需流动性的开发商由于无法从正式银行部门获得融资，不得不以极高的利率借入大量贷款。 但是，在许多情形中，房地产需求的增长赶不上预期，这提高了违约风险 — — 其效应将传递给整个金融部门。 事实上，中国从未像今天那样如此接近重大金融危机。 但中国货币当局似乎并不清楚风险的规模，也不清楚它的根源。 中国经济或许急需去杠杆。 但是，决策不能盲目地收紧信用供给，而必须深化金融部门改革，实现存款利率自由化，取消量化工具，最重要的是，必须允许成立国内私人金融机构。 追求这些日程对于中国的长期金融和经济健康来说是至关重要的。 但这样做需要中国货币当局转换思维。 而中国今天所面临的挑战也正在这里。"

            "Janet Yellen’s New Financial Multilateralism LONDON – The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have sprung into action in ways that would have been inconceivable even a year ago. Under former President Donald Trump, the United States – the main shareholder, with veto rights, in both institutions – did little (beyond causing occasional disruption) to shape their policies. Now, the US is taking the lead in coordinating their role and helping poor countries to respond to the COVID-19 crisis. Spearheading this approach is US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. In a letter to her G20 colleagues last month, Yellen wrote that no single country can “declare victory” over the “dual health and economic crises” caused by the pandemic. “This,” she added, “is a moment made for action and for multilateralism.” But it does mark a welcome departure from Trump’s recklessness and negligence. And it does seek real action that the Trump administration had opposed: the strengthening of the IMF and World Bank toolkits, including the Fund’s concessional facilities, and a new allocation of its reserve asset, special drawing rights (SDRs), to increase liquidity for low-income countries. These countries certainly need help, not least because the COVID-19 crisis has worsened many of their debt positions significantly. To be sure, the G20 has already devised a two-pronged approach to helping highly indebted countries. First, it is providing temporary debt relief – until this June, though it may be extended – through the Debt Service Suspension Initiative. Second, it plans to improve debt sustainability through the Common Framework for Debt Treatments. But such support needs to be expanded. Fortunately, now that the US has dropped its opposition to a new SDR allocation, the G20 has agreed to allow the IMF to work on one. The value of the SDR is based on a basket of currencies (the US dollar, the euro, the Japanese yen, the Chinese renminbi, and the British pound). While SDRs don’t function as a currency, they can be exchanged for freely usable currencies. The SDR was not designed to help low-income countries. Instead, it was intended to supplement IMF member countries’ official reserves and address liquidity problems, at a time when the US dollar was directly convertible into gold. Given this, the share of SDRs each country receives in a given allocation is determined by their IMF quotas. In accordance with this system, G20 countries would receive 68% of an SDR allocation, with the US, the United Kingdom, and the largest European Union economies claiming a whopping 48%. Meanwhile, poor countries would receive just 3.2% of the same allocation. In other words, SDRs tend to accrue to those who need them least. And low-income countries are more likely to convert the SDRs they do receive to freely usable currencies. Recognizing this, Yellen has signaled a willingness to consider potential solutions. For example, G20 countries could channel the SDRs they don’t need to support economic recovery in low-income countries. This could open the way for the creation of SDR-based funds. Yet, even according to the existing allocation system, an SDR allocation worth 100% of current IMF quotas – as Italy, which currently heads the G20, advocates – would generate approximately SDR 15.2 billion for the poorest countries. That is more than the IMF’s annual average concessional lending through the Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (SDR 1.25 billion). Moreover, SDRs have no conditions attached. So, by advocating their use, Yellen has effectively acknowledged that flexible and unconditional liquidity – not concessional lending – is the ultimate safety net. At the same time, she stresses sound governance and the need to establish shared parameters, thereby strengthening transparency and accountability in SDR exchanges. This gets us to the elephant in the room: How will countries use their SDRs? Should they be allowed to use them, say, to service bilateral debt? In that case, such multilateral money could end up benefiting bilateral creditors like China – an outcome against which Yellen’s predecessor, Steven Mnuchin, warned. Answering such questions will require a broader effort to address the many gaping holes in the current multilateral financial system – holes that have often left financially needy countries with few good options. As a result, low-income countries have often had to turn to onerous bilateral lending, and have become hostage to private creditors and mixed entities, such as China’s state-owned banks. This has created significant asymmetries among different types of debt, and different types of creditors. To tackle these problems, multilateral financial tools must be made available to countries in need. Moreover, the G20 must take stronger action to bolster debt sustainability, coordinate international action, and broker fair debt deals between bilateral creditors, especially China, and low-income debtors. The good news is that Yellen – with her emphasis on governance, flexibility, and availability – seems to recognize the lacunae in the international financial architecture. One hopes that she continues to lead the way toward a new financial multilateralism that addresses them.",
            "珍妮特·耶伦的新金融多边主义 发自伦敦—国际货币基金组织和世界银行已经在以各种一年前想都不敢想的方式行动起来。 在前总统特朗普治下，作为这两个机构主要股东且拥有否决权的美国（除了偶尔滋扰一下之外）在塑造两者政策方面几乎无所作为。 而如今美国正牵头协调它们的角色以协助穷国应对新冠危机。 带头实施这一做法的是美国财政部长珍妮特·耶伦。 在上个月写给G20集团财政部长的一封信中，耶伦指出没有任何一个国家可以在这场疫情造成的“健康和经济双重危机”中独自“宣布获胜 ” ， 并补充说“这是一个为行动和多边主义而生的时刻 。 ” 耶伦这封信可能并不像国际货币基金组织总裁克里斯塔利娜·格奥尔基耶娃（Kristalina Georgieva）所鼓吹的那样标志着一个新“布雷顿森林时刻”的发端，但确实标志着对特朗普鲁莽失职行径的快乐告别，同时也确实尝试去实施曾遭特朗普政府反对的真正行动：补强基金组织和世界银行的工具箱，包括基金组织的优惠贷款机制，以及对其储备资产（特别提款权）实施新的分配以增加低收入国家的流动性。 这些低收入国家当然是需要帮助的，尤其是因为新冠危机导致它们的大量债务偿付严重恶化。 当然G20集团也已经制定了一个双管齐下的办法来帮助重债国。 首先，它正在通过“暂缓最贫困国家债务偿付倡议”提供临时债务减免 — — 有效期到今年6月，而且可能会延长；其二，它计划通过《缓债倡议后续债务处理共同框架》来改善债务的可持续性。 但这种支持需要被进一步扩大。 所幸美国如今放弃了对新特别提款权分配的抵制，G20集团也已经同意让国际货币基金组织制定一个特别提款权分配方案。 特别提款权的价值基于一篮子货币（美元、欧元、日元、人民币和英镑 ） 。 虽然它并不具备货币的功能，但可以被兑换成可以自由使用的货币。 但特别提款权本身并不是为帮助低收入国家而设计的，相反它的目的是（在美元还能直接兑换成黄金的时候）补充国际货币基金组织成员国的官方储备和解决流动性问题。 因此每个国家在某次分配中获得的特别提款权份额将由其基金组织配额决定。 在这一制度下G20集团国家将获得68%的特别提款权分配，其中美英和几个最大的欧盟经济体将获得高达48%的配额，而贫穷国家只能获得3.2%的配额。 换句话说，特别提款权往往会被分派给那些最不需要它的国家，而低收入国家则更有可能将其获得的特别提款权兑换成可自由使用的货币。 有鉴于此，耶伦已经暗示愿意考虑潜在的解决方案。 例如G20集团国家可以将它们不需要的特别提款权用于支持低收入国家经济复苏，而这也可以为建立一些基于特别提款权的基金开辟道路。 但正如目前担任G20集团轮值主席国的意大利所主张的那样，就算在现行分配制度下，分配基金组织当前100%可调用配额的特别提款权也能为那些最贫困国家带来约152亿特别提款权，这比国际货币基金组织通过减贫与增长信托基金提供的年平均优惠贷款额（12.5亿特别提款权）还要多。 此外特别提款权不会附加任何条件，因此耶伦动用特别提款权的主张实际上是承认了灵活无条件的流动性 — — 而非优惠贷款 — — 才是最终的安全网。 同时她还强调了健全治理和建立共享参数的必要性，从而加强了特别提款权交易所具备的透明度和问责制。 这会使我们将目光转向一个长期被刻意忽视的重大问题：各国将如何使用特别提款权？ 是否应该允许它们将其用于偿还双边债务等行为？ 在这种情况下这种多边资金最终可能会使中国这类双边债权人受益 — — 耶伦的前任史蒂文·姆努钦（Steven Mnuchin）曾就此发出过警告。 要回答这些问题就需要作出更大范围的努力去堵塞当前多边金融体系中存在的大量漏洞 — — 这些漏洞往往会逼得那些有财务需求的国家无法去选择一些良好的财务选项。 为此低收入国家往往不得不转而求助于负担沉重的双边贷款，并受制于私人债权人和中国国有银行这类混合实体。 这造成了不同类型债务和不同类型债权人之间的严重不对称状况。 如果要解决这些问题就必须向有需要的国家提供多边金融工具。 此外G20集团必须采取更有力的行动去改善债务可持续性，协调国际行动，并在双边债权人（尤其是中国）和低收入债务人之间促成公平的借款交易。 好消息是强调治理、灵活性和可用性的耶伦似乎认识到了国际金融架构的缺陷。 我们也希望她能继续带领大家迈向解决这些问题的新金融多边主义之路。"

            "What Yellen Must Do NEW YORK – US President-elect Joe Biden’s decision to appoint Janet Yellen as the next Secretary of the Treasury is good news for America and the world. The United States has survived four years under a mendacious president who has no understanding of, let alone respect for, the rule of law, the principles undergirding democracy and the market economy, or even basic human decency. Not only has Donald Trump spent the weeks since the presidential election spewing lies about non-existent voter fraud; he has also convinced a large majority of his party to embrace these lies, thus revealing the frailty of American democracy. Undoing the damage will not be easy, especially with the COVID-19 pandemic compounding America’s problems. Fortunately, no one is better equipped – in intellect, experience, values, and interpersonal skills – to deal with today’s economic challenges than Yellen, whom I first met when she was a graduate student at Yale University in the 1960s. First on the agenda will be recovery from the pandemic. With multiple vaccines in sight, the immediate task is to build a bridge from here to the post-crisis economy. It is too late for a “V-shaped recovery.” Many businesses have gone bankrupt, and many more will do so in the coming weeks and months; household and firm balance sheets are being eviscerated. Worse, headline figures may belie the depth of the crisis. The pandemic has taken a massive toll at the bottom of the income and wealth distribution. Those who have availed themselves of policies to prevent evictions and foreclosures are nonetheless falling deeper into debt, and could soon face a reckoning. The current outlook would have been much better if only we had had a president and Congress that recognized back in May that COVID-19 would not just disappear on its own. Strong initial support programs that needed to be extended were not, resulting in avoidable economic damage that will now be hard to reverse. The devastation of the restaurant and travel industries has received plenty of attention, but this may be merely the tip of the iceberg. Educational institutions, especially many colleges and universities, have been hit badly. And state and local governments constrained by balanced-budget laws now face plummeting revenues. Without federal aid, they will have to make deep cuts to employment and public programs, which will weaken the broader economy. The US desperately needs large rescue programs targeted specifically at the most vulnerable households and sectors. The resulting debt from increased spending should not be viewed as a hindrance, given the enormous cost of doing too little. Besides, with interest rates near zero and likely to stay there for years to come, the costs of servicing new debt are exceedingly low. Moreover, many of the necessary recovery programs can be designed to serve multiple goals, by putting the economy on a more sustainable, resilient, and knowledge-based footing. Much will depend on Congress, but the economic case for providing more support is clear, and Yellen is well equipped to articulate it. Much will depend on the global recovery as well. Here, the new administration will have more room to maneuver. There is already strong global support for a massive $500 billion issuance of Special Drawing Rights, the supranational currency overseen by the International Monetary Fund, which would go a long way toward supporting many struggling economies. Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi blocked this option. It should now be at the top of the agenda. Moreover, with many countries soon to be unable to meet their debt obligations, a quick and deep restructuring would help enormously. To move that process forward, the Biden administration should state clearly that it is in America’s own national interest to uphold the basic principle of sovereign immunity, as endorsed by the overwhelming majority of United Nations member states in 2015. Debt restructuring is necessary for the global recovery and is the humanitarian thing to do. If there was ever a time when the principle of force majeure should apply, it is now. Restoring multilateralism would help, too. For the past four years, innumerable conflicts between the US and everyone else has cast a pall of uncertainty over the global economy. It should go without saying that uncertainty is bad for business and bad for investment. A return to normalcy on the part of the US – rejoining the Paris climate agreement and the World Health Organization, for example, and re-engaging with the World Trade Organization (and allowing judges to be appointed to its Appellate Body) – would thus go a long way toward restoring confidence. But a return to normalcy must not mean a return to neoliberalism. On trade and many other aspects of the twenty-first-century economic framework, policy agendas need to be revisited and reformed. It is unclear how far Biden will go down this road. But we can at least be confident that the new administration won’t embrace the zero-sum logic that underpinned Trump’s approach to everything. Ensuring global stability will require deep cooperation in combating climate change, pandemics, and many other threats. The challenge will be to find ways to do so while remaining fully and vocally committed to our values. While Trump severely undermined the international political and economic order, its fissures were long evident before he arrived. After all, the 2008 financial crisis discredited neoliberalism, with its belief in unfettered deregulation; and the subsequent euro crisis demonstrated that austerity under such conditions does not work. It is clear that neoliberalism has led to lower growth, higher inequality, and all of the social and political consequences that we have seen in recent years. Now, the pandemic has put the final nail in neoliberalism’s coffin, revealing an economy utterly lacking in resilience and a state left incapable of responding effectively to a crisis. Yellen can help to provide the leadership necessary to build a better post-pandemic world. To succeed, an ideology that serves the few at the expense of the many must give way to one based on democratic values and shared prosperity.",
            "耶伦的要务 发自纽约—美国候任总统乔·拜登（Joe Biden）任命珍妮特·耶伦（Janet Yellen）作为下一任财政部长的决定对美国和世界来说都是个好消息。 美国在满嘴跑火车的特朗普总统手下熬过了四年 — — 此人对法治，民主和市场经济的底层原则甚至人类的基本行为守则一无所知，更谈不上心怀敬意了。 自大选落幕以来，特朗普不仅花费了数周的时间去散播子虚乌有的选民欺诈谣言，还说服了他所属党派的大多数成员去听信这些谎言，从而揭示了美国民主制度的脆弱性。 修复这些损害并非易事，尤其是在新冠疫情加剧了美国各项问题的情况下。 幸运的是，没有任何人具备比耶伦更高的才智、经验，价值观和人际交往能力来应对当今的经济挑战 — — 我俩在她1960年代在耶鲁大学读研究生时就相识了。 首要议程是从疫情中实现复苏。 随着多款疫苗有望面世，当前的任务是建立从眼下到后危机经济的桥梁。 现在再谈论“V形复苏”为时已晚，许多企业已经破产，而在随后几周和几个月中还会有更多企业破产；家庭和公司的资产负债表也都日益空虚。 更糟糕的是新闻头条中的数据可能掩盖了危机的深度。 疫情对那些居于收入和财富分配金字塔底层的民众造成了巨大伤害。 那些被政策免于强行驱逐和没收抵押房屋的人仍在逐步滑向债务的深渊，并可能很快面临重大清算。 如果我们的总统和国会能在五月意识到新冠病毒不会自性消失的话，当前的前景将会好得多。 由于当时未能出台强有力的初期支持计划，导致了本可以避免但如今已是难以扭转的经济损失。 餐饮业和旅游业的崩溃已经引起了广泛关注，但这可能只是冰山一角。 教育机构 — — 特别是许多高等教育机构 — — 受到了严重打击。 受到相关预算平衡法规约束的州和地方政府如今都面临着收入暴跌的局面。 在缺乏联邦援助的情况下它们只得大幅削减就业和公共计划，进而削弱整个经济。 美国迫切需要一些专门针对最脆弱家庭和部门的大型救援计划。 鉴于作为不足可能产生的巨大成本，因此不应将增加支出所产生的债务视为障碍。 此外由于利率接近于零并且可能会在未来几年维持类似水平，偿还新债务的成本将非常低。 此外，通过将经济置于更加可持续、更具弹性和基于知识的基础上，许多必要的复苏计划都可以被设计去服务多个目标。 这在很大程度上将取决于国会，但是提供更多支持的经济理由是明确的，而耶伦也具备充分的能力去予以表述。 此外这在很大程度上还有赖于全球复苏。 在这方面新总统将有更大的回旋余地。 在国际上有很高的呼声支持发行高达5000亿美元特别提款权（国际货币基金组织监管下的超国家货币 ） ， 这也会对许多陷入困境的经济体大有裨益。 特朗普和印度总理纳伦德拉·莫迪（Narendra Modi）过去阻止了这一选项，如今应该将其置于议程的首位。 此外，由于许多国家很快会面临无法偿还自身债务的状况，因此迅速而深入的重组将极大地帮助这些国家。 为了推动这一进程，拜登政府应明确声明坚持主权豁免的基本原则符合美国自身的国家利益 — — 这一原则在2015年也获得了联合国绝大多数会员国的背书。 债务重组对于全球复苏很有必要，也是一项人道主义工作。 如果说有什么时候可以适用不可抗力的原则，那就是现在了。 恢复多边主义也将有所帮助。 在过去的四年中，美国与其他国家之间无数的冲突使得全球经济充满了不确定性。 这种不确定性显然既不利于生意也不利于投资。 因此美国恢复到正常状态 — — 例如重新加入巴黎气候协定和世界卫生组织，并与世界贸易组织再次展开接触（并批准其上诉机构重新任命法官 ） — —将极大有助于各界恢复信心。 但是恢复正常状态并不意味着要恢复新自由主义。 在二十一世纪经济框架下的贸易以及许多其他方面，我们都需要重新审议和改革政策议程。 目前虽不清楚拜登将沿着这条路线走多远，但我们至少可以确信新政府将不会采纳支撑特朗普一切所作所为的零和逻辑。 确保全球稳定将需要在抗击气候变化，流行病和许多其他威胁方面开展深入合作。 而挑战则在于必须在找到相应方法的同时保持对我们价值观的全面和明确承诺。 尽管特朗普严重破坏了国际政治和经济秩序，但这方面的裂痕在他上任之前就早已显而易见了。 毕竟，2008年的金融危机已经使新自由主义及其无约束放宽管制理念声名狼藉。 随后的欧元危机表明在这种情况下实行紧缩政策是行不通的。 我们近年所见的增长放慢，不平等加剧以及所有社会和政治后果显然都是新自由主义所导致的。 如今这场疫情则展现了一个完全缺乏抗冲击能力的经济以及一个无力有效应对危机的国家，也为新自由主义的棺材钉上了最后一颗钉子。 耶伦可以提供必要的领导才能以建立一个更美好的疫情后世界。 如果想要实现这一点，一种靠牺牲多数人利益来为少数派服务的意识形态必须让位于基于民主价值观和共同繁荣的意识形态。"

            "From Yellow Vests to the Green New Deal NEW YORK – It’s old news that large segments of society have become deeply unhappy with what they see as “the establishment,” especially the political class. The “Yellow Vest” protests in France, triggered by President Emmanuel Macron’s move to hike fuel taxes in the name of combating climate change, are but the latest example of the scale of this alienation. There are good reasons for today’s disgruntlement: four decades of promises by political leaders of both the center left and center right, espousing the neoliberal faith that globalization, financialization, deregulation, privatization, and a host of related reforms would bring unprecedented prosperity, have gone unfulfilled. While a tiny elite seems to have done very well, large swaths of the population have fallen out of the middle class and plunged into a new world of vulnerability and insecurity. Even leaders in countries with low but increasing inequality have felt their public’s wrath. By the numbers, France looks better than most, but it is perceptions, not numbers, that matter; even in France, which avoided some of the extremism of the Reagan-Thatcher era, things are not going well for many. When taxes on the very wealthy are lowered, but raised for ordinary citizens to meet budgetary demands (whether from far-off Brussels or from well-off financiers), it should come as no surprise that some are angry. The Yellow Vests’ refrain speaks to their concerns: “The government talks about the end of the world. We are worried about the end of the month.” There is, in short, a gross mistrust in governments and politicians, which means that asking for sacrifices today in exchange for the promise of a better life tomorrow won’t pass muster. And this is especially true of “trickle down” policies: tax cuts for the rich that eventually are supposed to benefit everyone else. When I was at the World Bank, the first lesson in policy reform was that sequencing and pacing matter. The promise of the Green New Deal that is now being championed by progressives in the United States gets both of these elements right. The Green New Deal is premised on three observations: First, there are unutilized and underutilized resources – especially human talent – that can be used effectively. Second, if there were more demand for those with low and medium skills, their wages and standards of living would rise. Third, a good environment is an essential part of human wellbeing, today and in the future. If the challenges of climate change are not met today, huge burdens will be imposed on the next generation. It is just wrong for this generation to pass these costs on to the next. It is better to leave a legacy of financial debts, which our children can somehow manage, than to hand down a possibly unmanageable environmental disaster. Almost 90 years ago, US President Franklin D. Roosevelt responded to the Great Depression with his New Deal, a bold package of reforms that touched almost every aspect of the American economy. But it is more than the symbolism of the New Deal that is being invoked now. It is its animating purpose: putting people back to work, in the way that FDR did for the US, with its crushing unemployment of the time. Back then, that meant investments in rural electrification, roads, and dams. Economists have debated how effective the New Deal was – its spending was probably too low and not sustained enough to generate the kind of recovery the economy needed. Nonetheless, it left a lasting legacy by transforming the country at a crucial time. So, too, for a Green New Deal: It can provide public transportation, linking people with jobs, and retrofit the economy to meet the challenge of climate change. At the same time, these investments themselves will create jobs. It has long been recognized that decarbonization, if done correctly, would be a great job creator, as the economy prepares itself for a world with renewable energy. Of course, some jobs– for example, those of the 53,000 coal miners in the US – will be lost, and programs are needed to retrain such workers for other jobs. But to return to the refrain: sequencing and pacing matter. It would have made more sense to begin with creating new jobs before the old jobs were destroyed, to ensure that the profits of the oil and coal companies were taxed, and the hidden subsidies they receive eliminated, before asking those who are barely getting by to pony up more. The Green New Deal sends a positive message of what government can do, for this generation of citizens and the next. It can deliver today what those who are suffering today need most – good jobs. And it can deliver the protections from climate change that are needed for the future. The Green New Deal will have to be broadened, and this is especially true in countries like the US, where many ordinary citizens lack access to good education, adequate health care, or decent housing. The grassroots movement behind the Green New Deal offers a ray of hope to the badly battered establishment: they should embrace it, flesh it out, and make it part of the progressive agenda. We need something positive to save us from the ugly wave of populism, nativism, and proto-fascism that is sweeping the world.",
            "从黄背心到绿色新政 纽约 — — 这个社会大部分人对其眼中的“体制 ” ， 尤其是政治阶层，深感不满早已不是什么新闻。 因伊曼纽尔·马克龙总统以对抗气候变化为名提高燃油税所引发的法国“黄背心”抗议运动不过是这种异化规模的最新例证。 今天民众不满的理由非常充分：四十年来，中左翼和中右翼的政治领袖一直承诺的全球化、金融化、放松管制、私有化以及一系列相关改革将带来前所未有繁荣的支撑新自由主义信仰的承诺已经彻底落空。 尽管一小撮精英阶层似乎过得逍遥自在，但大批民众已经退出了中产阶层，陷入到一个充满脆弱和不安全的新世界当中。 就连那些不平等状况并不严重但却正在不断加剧的国家的领袖也已经感受到了民众的愤怒。 从统计数据看，法国似乎好于绝大多数，但实际起到决定作用的并非数字，而是民众的感受；即便在避免了里根-撒切尔时代某些极端主义的法国，对许多人来讲，状况也并不令人羡慕。 当针对非常富有的群体实行税收减免，同时却对普通民众加税以满足预算要求时（无论命令来自遥远的布鲁塞尔还是富裕的金融家 ） ， 不出所料某些人都会感到愤怒。 黄背心们的口号表达了他们的忧虑 ： “ 政府在谈论世界末日。 而我们则担心这个月底能不能顺利度过 。 ” 简言之，民众对政府和政客存在严重的不信任，这意味着要求以今天的牺牲来换取明天美好生活的许诺不会被民众所接受。 对所谓“涓滴”政策而言，情况尤其如此：为富裕阶层减税被认为最终会惠及所有人。 我曾在世界银行工作，当时第一堂政策改革课就是确定优先顺序和节奏。 绿色新政承诺现在正得到美国进步人士的支持，而绿色新政承诺很好地兼顾了上述两种因素。 绿色新政基于以下三种观点：首先，特定资源 — — 尤其是人力资源 — — 没有而且也尚未得到充分的利用。 其次，如果对中低技术人员的要求增加，就要相应提高他们的工资和生活水平。 第三，无论现在还是将来，良好环境都是人类福祉的重要组成部分。 如果今天不去应对气候变化挑战，巨大的负担将会落到下一代人身上。 这一代人将这些成本转嫁给下一代人是一种错误。 好一点的方式是转嫁可以以某种方式进行管理的金融债务，而不是让我们的子女面对可能无法控制的环境灾难。 将近90年前，美国总统富兰克林·罗斯福以新政来应对大萧条，新政是一套触及美国经济几乎方方面面的大胆的改革举措。 但现在正在被唤起的不仅限于新政的象征意义，而是新政令人鼓舞的目标：让人们重新回去工作，就像富兰克林·罗斯福为当时失业率高到令人崩溃的美国所做的那样。 当时，这意味着投资农村电气化、道路和水坝。 经济学家一直争论新政所取得的效果 — — 新政开支可能太低，且持续性不够，很难产生人们真正需要的那种经济复苏。 尽管如此，新政仍然因在关键时刻实现国家转型而被后世所永远记住。 绿色新政也是一样：它可以提供联系人与工作岗位之间的公共交通，并改造经济以满足应对气候变化挑战的需求。 与此同时，这些投资本身也将创造就业机会。 人们早就认识到，以正确的方式脱碳能够创造大量就业机会，同时经济也能顺利渡过向可再生能源世界转型的过程。 当然，某些工作 — — 例如美国的53，000名矿工 — — 注定会失去，因此需要制定计划重新培训上述工人适应其他工作。 回到最初的论断：优先顺序和节奏。 在旧工作被摧毁前就创造出新的工作会更有意义，确保石油和煤炭企业的利润被征税、并取消它们所得到的隐形补助，而不是要求那些现在也只能勉强度日的司机去付账。 绿色新政传递了某种积极的信号，那就是政府可以为这一代和下一代民众做些什么。 它能为今天遭受苦难最重的人提供最需要的东西 — — 那就是好的工作。 它还能提供未来所需的气候变化保护。 绿色新政必须得到推广，这尤其适用于像美国这样仍有许多普通公民无法获得良好教育、充分医疗或体面住房的国家。 绿色新政背后的草根运动为已经受到严重破坏的现有体制提供了一线希望：他们应当拥抱这线希望、充实它并将其写入进步议程。 我们需要某种积极的事物令我们摆脱正在席卷世界的丑陋的民粹主义、本土主义和原始法西斯主义浪潮。"

            "Will the Yellow Vests Reject the Brown Shirts? PARIS – From the moment the French government canceled its planned fuel tax hike in the face of massive protests, it was obvious that the move would be perceived as inadequate, insignificant, and above all incapable of having any calming effect. Honor to whom honor is due: the Yellow Vests claim to be an expression of the sovereign people. But they now bear a heavy responsibility. For starters, they must announce a moratorium on demonstrations and blockades for a period long enough to accommodate the dialogue proposed by Prime Minister Édouard Philippe, if not longer. In particular, they should renounce the much-touted December 8 “Act IV” of the movement, brewing on Facebook since Saturday evening, which everyone expects to be more violent, destructive, and tragic than the preceding installments. There have been enough deaths, injuries, and damage (including to some of the most famous monuments in Paris). If the Yellow Vests decide the machine they have unleashed has overtaken them, and they can no longer stop Act IV, they must be prepared during the protests to help the police flush out the violent “brown vests” who will be circulating among them. Because the wreckers of the far right and far left will surely reappear to vandalize, terrorize, and desecrate; it is up to the Yellow Vests to say once again, this time as if they really mean it: Not in our name. Whether the Yellow Vests declare a moratorium or continue to protest, nothing would serve their cause better than to dissociate themselves – decisively and unambiguously – from all the political profiteers who would capitalize on their misery. The cast of opportunists is well known. Here is Jean-Luc Mélenchon, who, having finished fourth in the 2017 presidential election won by Emmanuel Macron, is desperately seeking a new following. There is François Ruffin, the leader of the anti-austerity movement Nuit debout, with his irresponsible anti-republican calls of “Resign, Macron!” And over there is Marine Le Pen, oscillating comically between taking pride in and repenting her call to occupy the Champs Élysées last Saturday, thereby becoming accountable for the worst of what was said and done there. And there the intellectuals who, in the manner of Luc Ferry and Emmanuel Todd, suggest that it was perhaps not “by chance” that the wreckers had such an easy time approaching, storming, and sacking the Arc de Triomphe. Such rhetoric lays the worst of all traps for a popular movement: the trap of conspiratorial thinking. In other words, the Yellow Vests are at a crossroads. Either they will be bold enough to stop and take the time they need to get organized, following a path not unlike that of Macron’s own La République en Marche !, which, in hindsight, might appear to be the Yellow Vests’ first-to-arrive twin. Macron’s movement, too, had right and left wings. And it knew that it was a new political body, engaging in a dialogue or even a showdown that would lead to an honest reckoning with poverty and the high cost of living. If the Yellow Vests build a movement that rises to the height of Macron’s, it may end up writing a page in the history of France. Or the Yellow Vests may turn out to lack that boldness and settle for the paltry pleasure of being seen on television. They will allow themselves to become intoxicated by the sight of luminaries and experts of la France d’en haut (elite France) seeming to eat from their hands and hanging on their every word. But if the Yellow Vests allow passionate hate to win out over genuine fraternity and choose wrecking over reforming, they will bring only chaos, not improvement, to the lives of humble and vulnerable people. They will careen off into the darkest side of the political night, and end up in the dustbin of history, where they can rub elbows with those other yellows, the early-twentieth-century “Yellow Socialists” of the proto-fascist syndicalist Pierre Biétry. The Yellow Vests must choose: democratic re-invention, or an updated version of the national socialist leagues; a will to repair, or the urge to destroy. The decision will hinge on the historic essence of the movement – whether its reflexes are good or bad, and whether, in the final analysis, it possesses political and moral courage. So the ball is in the Yellow Vests’ court. They have the initiative as much as Macron does. Will they say, “Yes, we believe in republican democracy?” And will they say it loud and clear, without equivocation? Or will they place themselves in the tradition of paranoid nihilism and pollute their ranks with the political vandals that France still produces in abundance?",
            "黄背心会抵制棕衫队吗？ 巴黎 — — 从法国政府面对大规模抗议活动取消其原计划大幅上调燃油税的那一刻起，显而易见，人们对此次运动的看法将会是不充分、不足道，而且最重要的是，无法带来任何安抚情绪的效果。 荣誉属于那些值得赞许的人：黄背心自称是主权民众的代表。 但他们现在所肩负的责任却是沉重的。 首先，他们必须宣布一段足够长的示威和封锁暂停期，以允许总理爱德华·菲利普所提出的对话。 特别是，他们应当放弃此次备受追捧的12月8日运动“第四幕”计划，该计划从周六傍晚起就在Facebook上被传得沸沸扬扬，所有人都预计这次行动会比前几次更暴力、更具破坏性，也更具悲剧色彩。 最近发生的死亡、伤害和破坏（包括对巴黎某些最著名的遗迹）已经足够多了。 如果黄背心们认为他们启动的机器已经超出了自身的控制，而且他们无法再阻止第四幕的发生，那么他们必须随时准备配合警察开展对混在他们当中崇尚暴力的“棕背心”的清洗活动。 因为极右翼和极左翼肇事者肯定会再次出现，破坏、恐吓并亵渎这次运动；黄背心们必须再次明确表态，而且这次表态必须非常郑重：这并不是我们想要的效果。 无论黄背心宣布暂停抑或继续抗议活动，对他们而言最好的策略都是果断且毫不含糊地与那些利用他们痛苦的政治投机者脱钩。 机会主义者的阵容是人尽皆知的。 其中包括梅朗雄，他在2017年总统大选中排名第四，位列胜选的伊曼纽尔·马克龙之后，而他现在正拼命寻求新的支持者。 此外还包括弗朗索瓦·鲁芬，鲁芬是反紧缩运动Nuit debout的领袖，他一直到处散播不负责任的反共和言论，不断高呼“辞职，马克龙 ! ” 此外，阵容中还包括马琳·勒庞，她在为上周六占领香榭丽舍大街感到骄傲和悔恨之间不停地摇摆，因此可以说，她应当为那里所发生的最糟局面负责。 还有像卢克·费里和伊曼纽尔·托德那样的知识分子，他们认为破坏者如此轻而易举地靠近、攻陷和洗劫凯旋门可能并不是“偶然”的。 上述言论为群众运动所能陷入的最可怕陷阱打下了基础：那就是阴谋论思维。 换言之，黄背心们正站在十字路口。 他们或者大胆地停下来，留出足够的时间重新组织，然后再沿着与马克龙自身的法国前进运动类似的道路继续往前走。 事后看来，马克龙的法国前进运动似乎与黄背心们有着诸多的相似之处。 马克龙的运动同样分为右翼和左翼，而且它清楚自身是新的政治机构，因此全心全意进行对话甚至是摊牌，从而促使人们对贫困和生活成本居高不下等问题进行诚实的思考。 如果黄背心最终发展为一个与马克龙达到同等高度的运动，那么它可能最终会被记入到法国的史书。 黄背心也可以被事实证明缺乏必要的胆略，并因为受到电视报道这样微不足道的乐趣而满足。 他们将允许自己为得到la France den haut（精英法国）的名人和专家的注意力所陶醉，看似心甘情愿地被他们所豢养并对他们的所有命令言听计从。 但如果黄背心允许激情仇恨压倒真正的兄弟情谊并选择破坏改革，那么他们只能祸乱而非改善卑微和脆弱民众的生活。 他们将陷入到政治黑夜最黑暗的一面，并最终被扫进历史的垃圾箱，在那里他们会与其他黄色运动不期而遇，比如20世纪初期皮埃尔·比奇特的亲法西斯工团“黄色社会主义者 ” 。 黄背心们必须在民主再造或国家社会主义联盟升级版之间作出选择；两者之间的差异在于修复的愿望抑或毁灭的冲动。 他们的决定将决定该运动的历史本质 — — 决定其反应是好是坏，以及归根结底，它是否是政治和道德勇气的秉持者。 因此球就在黄背心的脚下。 他们手握的主动权并不亚于马克龙。 他们会说 ， “ 是的，我们相信共和民主 ？ ” 他们会不会就此作出毫不含糊的明确表达？ 或者他们会屈服于偏执无政府主义的传统，最终任由依然在法国大量存在的政治破坏者们污染他们的队伍？"

            "Peace at Last for Yemen? PARIS – The long-running conflict in Yemen is riper for resolution than ever before. Yemenis on all sides are exhausted by the fighting and were quick to embrace the appeal issued in March by United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres for a global ceasefire amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The following month, the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen announced a two-week unilateral ceasefire, which it subsequently extended. The warring parties have already made significant progress toward a ceasefire agreement, in negotiations brokered by the UN Special Envoy for Yemen, Martin Griffiths. Furthermore, the separatist Southern Transitional Council (STC), which is backed by the United Arab Emirates, agreed in June to resume talks with Yemen’s Saudi-backed government, thereby ending the fighting in Abyan, Shabwa, and Socotra provinces. Iran, which supports the rebel Houthi movement (formally known as Ansar Allah, or Supporters of God), has no strategic reason to stand in the way of an agreement. Critically, although international powers including the United States, Russia, China, India, and leading European states are struggling to cooperate over Yemen, they are unlikely to obstruct progress toward ending the fighting. From the Kremlin to Whitehall to the White House, the desirability of ending the suffering in Yemen is widely recognized. Our countries have nothing to gain from the civil war continuing. Indeed, on July 1, the UN Security Council passed a resolution supporting Guterres’s appeal for a global ceasefire, a decision that can be leveraged to help Yemen. There is much to build on, but the opportunity must be seized. The current window to end the civil war will not remain open for long, and recent advances are now in jeopardy. If the window closes without the warring parties reaching a peace deal, Yemen risks descending into further chaos and conflict, raising the specter of a continuing catastrophe on the strategic Bab el-Mandab Strait. The tragic conflicts in Libya and Syria have devolved into complicated proxy wars that are not amenable to international mediation. Yemen is still some distance from that point, partly because fewer outside players are directly engaged in the conflict. But time is not on its side. Missing the current opportunity for peace would be unconscionable, given Yemen’s rapidly rising number of COVID-19 infections and its inability to respond to the pandemic. The remaining obstacles to a permanent ceasefire and a political deal include the conditions for opening the Sana’a airport and Hodeida port. The STC’s declaration of self-rule in April and the violence that followed have also complicated the peace process. And Ansar Allah’s June 23 attack on Riyadh underscores the risk of further escalation of fighting between the Houthis and the Saudi-led coalition. But none of these stumbling blocks is insurmountable. Yemen’s looming humanitarian disaster and its people’s pleas for peace require action on three levels. First, the warring parties should accept and immediately implement the UN-brokered ceasefire proposal, building on the Saudi-led coalition’s unilateral pause. Second, President Abd-Rabbuh Mansour Hadi’s Saudi-backed government and the STC should continue talks regarding the implementation of the November 2019 Riyadh Agreement signed by the two sides. The STC’s July 29 announcement that it would abandon its aspirations for self-rule marks a significant step forward that one hopes will further de-escalate tensions. Third, the international community must encourage all parties to the conflict to turn recent positive momentum into a comprehensive, durable, and just political settlement. A solution based on power sharing would allow Yemen to rebuild, prosper, and restore good relations with its neighbors. A Gulf Cooperation Council-led reconstruction effort in Yemen and a revitalization of regional trade would support this process and herald a new era of cooperation in the Gulf and the Arabian Peninsula. Although the warring parties must take the first steps forward, regional and global actors have an important role to play in ending the conflict now. This November’s G20 summit in Riyadh gives Saudi Arabia an opportunity to display international leadership and demonstrate progress on Yemen. Greater support for a deal from the international community, and especially the global powers, can tip the balance in favor of a lasting agreement. Peace is critical first and foremost for the long-suffering Yemeni people. But a lasting settlement would also serve as a confidence-building step toward stability in the Middle East, and would send a broader positive signal at a time of increasing international friction and polarization. Opportunities to resolve a prolonged civil war are rare. Ending the conflict in Yemen would save lives, bring hope to a failing region, and perhaps provide some inspiration for a tottering world.",
            "也门终于迎来和平？ 巴黎—也门的长期冲突解决时机已经成熟。 也门各方已经厌倦了战斗，很快就接受了3月份联合国秘书长古特雷斯所发起的号召 — — 在COVID-19疫情期间全球停火。 4月，沙特领导的也门联军宣布为期两周的单边停火，随后又有所延长。 在联合国也门特使马丁·格里菲斯（Martin Griffiths）的斡旋下，战争各方已就停火协议取得了重大进展。 此外，由阿联酋支持的分离主义的南部过渡委员会（STC）在6月同意重启与沙特支持的也门政府的谈判，进而结束阿比扬、沙巴瓦和索科特拉诸省的战斗。 支持胡塞反叛运动（正式名称是“神的支持者 ” ） 的伊朗也没有战略性的理由阻挠协议。 至关重要的是，尽管包括美国、俄罗斯、中国、印度和主要欧洲国家在内的国际力量在也门问题上还有分歧，但它们也不可能阻止让战斗停止的进程。 从克里姆林宫到白厅到白宫，停止也门惨象被广泛认为是令人期待的。 内战延续对于我们各国都没有好处。 事实上，7月1日，联合国安理会通过一项决议，支持古特雷斯的全球停火号召，这一决定也对帮助也门大有裨益。 我们还能大有作为，但必须抓住机会。 当前的结束内战机会窗口不会维持太久，最新进展情况也相当危急。 如果机会窗口流失，战争各方没有达成和平协议，那么也门有可能陷入进一步的混乱和冲突，甚至导致具战略重要性的曼德海峡的持续灾难。 利比亚和叙利亚的悲剧性冲突已演变为复杂的代理战争，无法通过国际调停解决。 也门距离这一步仍有距离，部分原因在于直接参与到也门冲突的外部势力较少。 但时间不利于也门。 丧失当下的和平机会是不可接受的，因为也门COVID-19感染数量在迅速增加，而也门根本无力应对疫情。 永久停火和政治协议的障碍包括开放萨那机场和荷台达港的条件。 STC在4月宣布自治以及随之而来的暴力也让和平进程变得错综复杂。 胡塞叛军6月23日对利雅得的袭击彰显出胡塞武装和沙特领导的联军之间冲突升级的风险。 但所有这些障碍都不是不可克服的。 即将到来的也门人道主义灾难以及也门人民对和平的呼吁要求我们从三个层面采取行动。 首先，战争各方应该接受并迅速落实联合国调停的停火方案，其基础是沙特领导的联军单方面停火。 其次，沙特支持的总统哈迪政府和STC应该继续就2019年11月双方签署的利雅得协定的落实进行谈判。 7月29日，STC宣布其将放弃自治计划，这是意义重大的一步，但愿能够进一步缓和紧张局势。 第三，国际社会必须鼓励冲突各方利用最近的积极态势，形成全面、持久、公正的政治和解方案。 基于权力共享的方案能让也门得以重建、繁荣和恢复睦邻友好。 海湾合作委员会领导的也门复兴计划以及地区贸易的恢复能够支持这一进程，并开启海湾和阿拉伯半岛的合作新时代。 第一步必须由战争各方迈出，但地区和全球行动方现在也能够在结束冲突方面起到重要作用。 今年11月的利雅得G20峰会给了沙特阿拉伯一次机会表现国际领导力，展示也门问题上的进展情况。 国际社会尤其是全球大国对协议的更大的支持能够让平衡向持久协议的方向倾斜。 对于长期遭难的也门人来说，和平是最关键、最重要的。 但持续和解也是构筑信心、通往中东稳定的一步，能够在国际摩擦和极化日益激烈之际释放出全面的积极信号。 解决漫长内战的机会是很罕见的。 结束也门冲突能够拯救生命，给失败地区带来希望，或许还能给举步维艰的世界带来一些启发。"

            "Can Yemen Be Saved? SANA'A – Yemen is no stranger to crisis. Exposed to a regional proxy war between Iran and Saudi Arabia, plagued by an entrenched Al Qaeda affiliate, and divided by tribal disputes and a secession movement, the country has become a poster child for everything that can go wrong in the Arab world. Yemen has demonstrated remarkable resiliency in the past. To ensure that the recent overthrow of its government by the Shia Houthi rebel movement does not deal Yemen the lethal blow that it has avoided so far, the international community must not abandon the country in what may be its hour of greatest need. The origins of the Houthi movement date to 1991, when it was created to protect Zaydism, a moderate form of Shi'ism, from the encroachment of Sunni Islamists. After the attacks on New York and Washington, DC, on September 11, 2001, the group's battle took on a geopolitical dimension, as its fighters objected to Yemen's decision to collaborate with the United States and enhance bilateral intelligence cooperation. From 2004 to 2010, the group fought six wars against the Yemeni government and even skirmished with Saudi Arabia. Yet it never managed to expand its reach beyond its stronghold in the north of the country. That changed in 2011, when the popular protests and political chaos stemming from the Arab Spring led to widespread institutional paralysis, allowing the Houthis to march past a military that largely refused to fight it. The group's power grab has frightened its adversaries, leading them to seek new alliances that could imperil the state's security. In the central region of Marib, home to the oil and gas facilities that Yemen relies on for foreign currency, several tribes have vowed to fight the Houthis. The region was once a stronghold of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), an affiliate of the global terrorist organization. If the military refuses to assist the tribes – as is likely – they may be tempted to turn to AQAP. The situation is no less precarious in the southern provinces, where a secession movement has been active since 2007. Southerners are up in arms because the Houthi rebellion halted plans for the adoption of a federal system, which would have given the region greater autonomy. In response, armed groups seized checkpoints and closed the port of Aden. The risk of secession is very real. Southern Sunnis have been marginalized since a 1994 civil war that left northerners in control of most of the country's political institutions. Many in the region worry that the Houthis will discriminate against them further. AQAP is firmly rooted in this region as well, implying the possibility that local residents will seek its help in defending against an expected Houthi onslaught. Meanwhile, Yemen continues to serve as a battleground in a proxy war between Iran and Saudi Arabia. Iran has armed and trained the Houthis, and, though the rebels' brand of Shi'ism shares little with that practiced in Tehran, they have praised the Islamic Republic's founder, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, and held up Iran's Lebanese proxy, Hezbollah, as a model to be emulated. When the Houthis took over Sana'a, the capital, in September, Saudi Arabia cut off aid to the country. To make matters worse, falling oil prices and attacks on pipelines imperil a hydrocarbon industry that provides 63% of government revenues. Decreased earnings led Yemen to forecast a $3.2 billion budget deficit last year. If the turmoil is not curtailed and the Saudis do not resume the payments that have long ensured the country's ability to function, Yemen may not be able to cover its expenditures. The US has followed Saudi Arabia's lead, shuttering its embassy and freezing intelligence cooperation and counterterrorism operations. This is a mistake. Yemen's military is largely intact, having remained in its barracks as the Houthis marched to the capital, and there is little evidence that the units that work with the Americans are loyal to the new rebel government. Suspending cooperation risks giving AQAP free rein in a country where it was able to wreak havoc even when bridled. Yemen is mired in crises that it cannot solve alone. Unless its international allies throw it a lifeline, it risks being swallowed by a sea of disorder that could imperil the entire region.",
            "也门还有救吗？ 萨那—也门对冲突绝不陌生。 也门暴露在伊朗和沙特阿拉伯的地区代理战争中，饱受根深蒂固的基地组织折磨，也因为部落纠纷和独立运动而分裂。 阿拉伯世界中的所有问题，你都可以在也门找到。 在过去，也门表现出引人注目的恢复力。 为了确保最近什叶派胡塞（Shia Houthi）反抗运动颠覆政府不会给也门造成其到目前为止成功避免了的致命一击，国际社会绝不能再也门最需要的时候放弃这个国家。 胡塞运动的起源可以追溯到1991年。 这一年，胡塞运动成立，初衷是保护什叶派伊斯兰教的温和形势斋德主义（Zaydism）不受逊尼派伊斯兰教迫害。 2001年9月11日纽约和华盛顿恐怖袭击发生后，该组织的战斗又增加了地缘政治维度，其战士拒绝也门与美国采取联合行动和加强双边情报合作的决定。 从2004到2010年，该集团与也门政府打了六场战争，甚至与沙特阿拉伯也产生过摩擦。 但它从未成功将势力范围推广到其牢牢掌握的也门北部以外。 2011年，形势发生了变化，阿拉伯之春所导致的群众游行和政治混乱引起了普遍的制度瘫痪，军队拒绝与胡塞运动分子作战。 该集团的得势令其对手大感恐惧，促使它们结成新的联盟，以至于危及国家安全。 在马利布（Marib，作为也门主要外汇来源的油气设施所在地）地区，多个部落都宣誓与胡塞运动斗争到底。 该地区曾为阿拉伯半岛基地组织（AQAP，基地组织的分支）所牢固掌握。 如果军队拒绝帮助部落 — — 很有可能如此 — — 它们就有可能倒向AQAP。 南部省份的情况尤其恶劣。 也门南部的分裂运动在2007年便已十分活跃。 南方人之所以武装起来，是因为胡塞叛军中止了采取联邦制的计划，而联邦制将带给南部更大的自治权。 结果，武装集团占领了检查站，关闭了亚丁港。 分裂的风险是实实在在的。 1994年的内战让北方人控制了也门的大部分政治机构，此后，南方的逊尼派就一直被边缘化。 该地区的许多人担心胡塞运动分子会更加歧视他们。 AQAP也在该地区根基深厚，这意味着当地居民可能寻求AQAP的帮助以抵抗预料中的胡塞运动突击。 与此同时，也门依然是伊朗和沙特阿拉伯之间的代理战争的战场。 伊朗武装并训练了胡塞运动，而尽管叛军的什叶派伊斯兰幌子与德黑兰的什叶派伊斯兰几乎没有共同之处，但他们歌颂伊朗伊斯兰共和国创始人霍梅尼，也支持其模仿对象、伊朗的黎巴嫩代理人真主党。 9月，当胡塞运动占领首都萨那时，沙特阿拉伯切断了对也门的援助。 更糟糕的是，油价下跌和对油管的袭击令石化行业岌岌可危，而石化行业贡献了也门63%的政府收入。 下降的收入导致也门去年预算赤字预计高达21亿美元。 如果动荡得不到遏制，并且沙特不重新开启长期以来作为也门正常运转保证的转移支付，也门可能无法筹得资金。 美国也步了沙特阿拉伯后尘，关闭了大使馆、冻结了情报合作和反恐行动。 这是错误的。 也门军队可以说毫无作为，在胡塞叛军兵临首都时仍然呆在军营里，也没有迹象表明与美国人合作的单位会忠于新的叛军政府。 中止合作有可能让AQAP主宰也门 — — 要知道，即使在饱受遏制时，AQAP也能在也门呼风唤雨。 也门陷入了它无法独力应对的危机中。 除非国际盟友伸出救命之手，否则也门可能会被无须吞没，整个地区也将岌岌可危。"

            "Yemen’s Regime Change Gets Personal SANAA – When Yemen’s President Ali Abdullah Saleh ordered his military on March 18 to fire on peaceful protesters calling for his resignation, he sealed his fate. A wave of military, government, and diplomatic defections, led by his long-time ally First Armored Brigade Commander General Ali Muhsin al-Ahmar, rocked his regime. But, although al-Ahmar announced that he was appalled by the use of force and vowed to defend the constitution, his decision was anything but altruistic. The disgruntled general, who has long-standing ties to the type of jihadists that the United States is battling in Yemen, merely sought to settle a score with the president’s family. The relationship between al-Ahmar and Saleh extends to their youth, with Saleh’s mother having had a second marriage to al-Ahmar’s uncle. Though they are not half-brothers, this frequent, if mistaken reference, indicates their closeness. Al-Ahmar has long been considered either Saleh’s right hand man or the country’s hidden president. When the Nasserite party attempted to overthrow Saleh less than 100 days into his presidency, al-Ahmar defended him and quashed the coup. In 1994, his units put down a secessionist movement in the south. But, as Saleh prepared the way for his son Ahmad – the head of the Presidential Guard – to succeed him, he began to marginalize al-Ahmar. In 2009, Saleh sacked al-Ahmar’s key backers, including Central Command Chief General al-Thahiri al-Shadadi and Lieutenant General Haydar al-Sanhani, from power. Al-Ahmar has also not benefited from the military aid that the US lavished on Yemen in the wake of al-Qaeda’s failed Christmas Day plot in 2009 to down an American airliner. While the Central Security Service, led by Saleh’s nephew Yahya, has received millions of dollars to fight al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, al-Ahmar has been left out of the economic bonanza. At the same time, al-Ahmar’s dismal performance in spearheading the war against the Houthi-led sectarian rebellion in the north made him a convenient scapegoat for the regime’s failures. The regime’s desire to get al-Ahmar out of the picture became clear during the last round of fighting aginst the Houthis in 2009-2010, when Saudi Arabia began bombing the rebels. According to a US diplomatic cable released by WikiLeaks, Yemeni officials gave the Saudis the coordinates for al-Ahmar’s command center, telling them that it was a Houthi camp. His relationship with Saleh frayed and his influence waning, al-Ahmar understood that his loyalty to Saleh had become a liability. So his decision to abandon Saleh stemmed less from his love of the constitution and democracy than from his desire to even the score with the president and his son Ahmad Saleh, with whom he has long clashed. Their units skirmished during the Houthi campaign, and the two engaged in a power struggle over defense of the radio and television stations. Saleh won at the time, but today al-Ahmar’s troops have control. Al-Ahmar’s relationship with jihadists is a source of serious concern. He is married to the sister of Tariq al-Fadhli, a Yemeni who fought alongside al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Ladin in Afghanistan. When more than 4,000 Arabs returned from fighting the Soviets there, al-Ahmar organized them into units and deployed them in the 1994 civil war. One jihadist who trained in al-Qaeda’s camps, and met bin Ladin, told me that upon his return from Afghanistan, he was invited to meet al-Ahmar’s associates and was given a monthly stipend. During a 1999 trial of Yemenis convicted of kidnapping 16 Europeans, it emerged that the group’s ringleader called al-Ahmar during the ordeal. Though his ties to jihadists may be expedient rather than ideological, they are deeply worrying. Today, Saleh’s support among his top generals is dwindling. Of Yemen’s four regional commanders, only Southern Command Chief General Mahdi Maqwala still backs him. Lesser lieutenant generals have deserted the president in droves. The fate of the country may not hinge on Saleh, a crafty veteran who knows that his career is over. But his son Ahmad, who is less politically astute, may yet seek to settle accounts with al-Ahmar. His forces have already clashed with rival units in Mukalla and surrounded the presidential palace in Aden. If the Salehs retain control of the air force, which remains under the control of Saleh’s half-brother, employing it against defecting military divisions would likely lead to a bloodbath. Nevertheless, the doomsday scenarios predicting anarchy and chaos in the post-Saleh era are most likely exaggerated. Unlike in Egypt, the vacuum resulting from Saleh’s departure can be quickly filled, so the country need not fall back on a military oligarchy. The Yemeni opposition is not only organized, but also plays an active role in politics and has true grassroots support. And, unlike in Egypt, where the ruling party was detested and out of touch with the masses, Yemen’s General People’s Congress has some following in society. If Saleh leaves peacefully and represses the urge to unleash the last remaining loyal army units against protesters and defecting soldiers, the country can avert Libya-like mayhem. Indeed, the opposition parties have already organized a transitional council to take Saleh’s place. With the sun quickly setting on the Saleh era, the president is out of options. The only decision before him and his thinning ranks of allies is whether to leave peacefully or go down fighting.",
            "沦为私人事务的也门政权更替 发自也门首都萨那 — — 从也门总统阿里·阿卜杜拉·萨利赫在3月18日命令部队向要求他下台的和平示威者开枪的那一刻起，他就已经注定走向末路了。 以他的长期盟友，精锐部队第一装甲师师长阿里·穆赫辛·阿赫玛尔将军为首的一众军队，政府和外交官员纷纷倒戈，使其统治当即陷入危机之中。 虽然阿赫玛尔将军声称对总统使用武力的决定深表震惊并呼吁保卫宪政，他的这一决定却肯定是别有用心的。 这位将军长期与美国在也门频繁打击的伊斯兰圣战分子过往甚密，同时也早已对总统本人心怀不满，而他本次的举动仅仅是要跟总统家族划清界限而已。 阿赫玛尔和萨利赫的关系可以追溯到他们的青年时代，当年萨利赫的母亲改嫁给了阿赫玛尔的叔叔。 虽然两人并无血缘关系，但这一频繁的交往（如果没错的话）也显示出两人关系非同一般。 阿赫玛尔一直以来都被视为萨利赫的左右手及也门的幕后总统。 当也门的纳塞尔主义党试图在萨利赫就任总统还不到100天的时候推翻他时，是阿赫玛尔站出来保护他并挫败了那场政变。 在随后的1994年，阿赫玛尔的部队又在也门南部地区镇压了一场分离主义运动。 但当萨利赫决定将总统职位交由其子阿赫玛德（现任总统卫队队长）继承之后，他就开始逐步将阿赫玛尔边缘化。 在2009年，萨利赫分别解除了阿赫玛尔的重要支持者，中央司令部司令塔希里·萨达迪将军以及海耶尔·萨哈尼中将的职务。 同时阿赫玛尔也没有从美国向也门提供的大规模军事援助（起因是基地组织于2009年圣诞针对一架美国客机的未遂袭击）中捞到任何好处。 当由萨利赫的侄子雅赫亚领导的也门中央情报机构坐收美国数百万美元打击阿拉伯半岛基地组织经费时，阿赫玛尔却只能眼睁睁地看着前者大发其财。 与此同时，阿赫玛尔在北部打击以胡锡为首的宗教反抗势力时的作战不力又使他经常被用作掩饰该政权种种弊端的替罪羊。 萨利赫政权试图将阿赫玛尔逐出最高权力的意图在2009-2010年的上一轮对胡锡分子作战行动中昭然若揭：根据维基解密网站所披露出来的美国外交电报，当沙特开始轰炸暴乱分子的时候，也门官员竟然向沙特方面提供了阿赫玛尔指挥部的坐标，并宣称那是一处胡锡暴乱分子的营地。 眼看着自己与萨利赫的关系逐渐恶化而自身的影响力日渐衰微，阿赫玛尔意识到自己对萨利赫的忠诚已经成为了一种负担。 因此他抛弃萨利赫的决定与其说是出于对宪法和民主的爱戴，不如说是为了与总统以及其子阿赫玛德·萨利赫（此人与阿赫玛尔也经常发生冲突）算账。 这两人所掌握的部队在镇压胡锡暴动期间已经发生过小规模冲突，并卷入了争夺广播电台和电视台的权力斗争中。 当时萨利赫赢得了胜利，如今阿赫玛尔又成为了赢家。 阿赫玛尔与伊斯兰圣战分子之间的关系总会引起极大的关注。 他的妻子就是基地组织领导人奥萨马·本·拉登在阿富汗的战友塔里克·法赫里的姐妹。 当4000多名阿拉伯人结束在阿富汗的抗苏战斗后，阿赫玛尔又将他们组织起来投入到了1994年的内战中。 一名曾在基地组织训练营受训并见过本·拉登的圣战分子告诉我，当他从阿富汗回到也门后就被阿赫玛尔招致麾下并按月发给工资。 在1999年对绑架16名欧洲人的也门人进行审判时，证据显示该团伙的头目在绑架过程中曾经致电阿赫玛尔。 而虽然阿赫玛尔与圣战分子的联系主要是策略上的而非意识形态上的，但这也足以令外界忧心不已了。 如今，萨利赫在高级军官中的支持度已经江河日下。 也门的4大军区指挥官中只有南部军区司令马赫迪·马克瓦拉将军依旧支持他。 更低级的中将们则大批倒向了总统的对立面。 这个国家的命运已经不再由萨利赫决定，而这个��猾的政治老手也知道自己的政治生涯已经终结。 但他的儿子，在政治上还不那么成熟的阿赫玛德，可能还会试图与阿赫玛尔达成交易。 阿赫玛尔的部队已经与位于木卡拉的敌对部队交火并包围了位于亚丁的总统官邸。 如果萨利赫家族还维持着对空军的控制力 — — 指挥权目前还在萨利赫的另一个兄弟手里 — — 并利用其对反对派部队发动进攻的话，那么结果将是一场血战。 此外，人们想象中的那种后萨利赫时代的政治乱局和社会动荡的末日景象可能也过于夸张了。 跟埃及不同，萨利赫下台所导致的权力真空将很快被填补，因此也门也不太可能会退回到军政府独裁的年代。 也门反对派不但极有组织，而且在政治方面也扮演着积极角色，同时又确实拥有草根民众的支持。 同时也门执政党全国人民大会党并不像埃及执政党那样遭人痛恨并且脱离群众，相反该党在社会上依然拥有一批追随者，如果萨利赫能和平下台并解散余下的那些镇压示威者和反抗部队的武装力量，也门就可以避免出现像利比亚那样的大混乱。 事实上，各反对党已经组织了一个过渡委员会以接替萨利赫的位置。 当萨利赫时代迅速落幕之时，总统本人已没有任何回旋余地。 摆在他及其不断萎缩的盟友面前的只有两个选择：要么和平地离开，要么还是继续顽抗下去。"

            "Japan vs. the Currency Speculators TOKYO – With Japan’s economy struggling to escape its deflationary torpor, the economic-revitalization plan that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe launched in 2012 has come under growing scrutiny. But Japan’s current travails, which have brought a concomitant decline in Japan’s stock market, stem from the yen’s appreciation – 24% over the last year – against major currencies. “Abenomics” – which included substantial monetary and fiscal expansion – has nothing to do with it. Since Abenomics was introduced, Japan’s labor market has improved considerably: 1.5 million new jobs have been created, and the unemployment rate has fallen to just over 3%. Moreover, corporate profits have soared, and tax revenues have increased by more than ‎¥20 trillion ($188 billion). To build on these gains, Japan has promised a large fiscal expansion next month, which some describe as a piecemeal, temporary version of so-called “helicopter drops” (permanent monetization of government debt). But there is concern that it will not be enough, if the yen continues to appreciate. To be sure, expansionary policies, particularly monetary policies – a pillar of Abenomics – could contribute to currency depreciation. But the US Federal Reserve’s dovish approach to exiting its own quantitative-easing program, together with expansionary policies in other major economies, has weakened their impact on the exchange rate. More recently, the United Kingdom’s vote to “Brexit” the European Union, together with the introduction of negative rates by multiple central banks, including the Bank of Japan (BOJ), shook markets. Taking advantage of this nervousness, hedge-fund managers and other speculators have increasingly been betting on the yen’s appreciation; indeed, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange shows substantial interest in the yen futures market. In a flexible exchange-rate system, each country conducts monetary policy independently, based on domestic objectives, and accepts the resulting exchange rate. But when exchange-rate movements become sharp or erratic, monetary authorities have the authority – even the obligation – to intervene to smooth them out. The Japanese authorities seem to recognize this, in theory. On August 18, officials from the Ministry of Finance (MOF), the Financial Services Agency, and the BOJ gathered to discuss what can be done to stem the yen’s appreciation. After the meeting, Masatsugu Asakawa, the deputy minister of finance for international affairs, declared that the MOF would act swiftly against exchange-rate movements deemed to be speculative. The announcement was supposed to cause speculators to shake in their boots. Yet markets moved only slightly, within a range of a couple of yen to the dollar. After all, the MOF has made such threats before – for example, just after the introduction of the BOJ’s negative interest-rate policy, and again after the Brexit decision – but never followed through. Like Aesop’s boy who cried wolf, the MOF has lost credibility, at least when it comes to the threat of intervention in currency markets. So speculators remain convinced that they are making a one-way bet – win big or break even – and continue to push the yen higher. At this point, the MOF’s words will not be enough to deter speculation. But the MOF remains hesitant to back its tough talk with action, not least because of American disapproval of supposed “currency manipulation.” High-level officials at the US Treasury and Federal Reserve actively try to dissuade advocacy of direct intervention, including by me. An American scholar reacted angrily when I merely mentioned the word, as if it were an obscenity. American officials, for their part, emphasize that if Japan can be accused of manipulating currency markets, the US Congress will not approve the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). It is possible that the MOF will choose to keep the US on its side, and continue to offer only empty threats to speculators. Or it may simply vacillate until it is too late to take real action. Either approach may well produce the same disastrous result: allowing the yen to appreciate to damaging levels and causing Abenomics to fail. What the MOF should do is intervene courageously in currency markets to stem the yen’s appreciation. Speculators will learn a tough lesson, and Japan’s economy could get back on track. Though Japan may become a scapegoat for the failure of the TPP, it seems unlikely that the deal would be ratified in any case, given the current political climate in the United States. An alternative would be for the BOJ to purchase foreign securities. Many hedge-fund managers, along with some economists, claim that the key to saving Japan’s economy from deflation is a more direct helicopter drop, with newly printed cash delivered directly to consumers. Yet these same people are impeding effective macroeconomic policy, by betting on the yen’s appreciation. Only when the speculators are brought to heel should such a bold – and highly risky – monetary policy even be up for discussion.",
            "日本 vs. 货币投机者 东京—日本经济正在竭力摆脱通缩麻木，首相安倍晋三在2012年推出的经济振兴计划也受到越来越多的审视。 但日本当前的艰苦来自日元兑其他主要货币的升值 — — 去年升值幅度达到了24 % ， 并导致日本股市也随之下跌。 包括大规模货币和财政扩张的“安倍经济学”与此毫无干系。 自安倍经济学实施以来，日本劳动力市场显著改善：新创150万工作岗位，失业率下跌至略高于3 % 。 此外，公司利润大幅增长，税收收入增加了20万亿多日元。 为了在此基础上更进一步，日本承诺下个月开始大规模财政扩张，有人称之为零散性、暂时性“直升机撒钱 ” （ 政府债务永久货币化 ） 。 但有人担心这还不够，如果日元继续升值的话。 诚然，扩张性政策，个别是货币政策 — — 安倍经济学的一大支柱 — — 可以带来货币贬值。 但美联储对于退出量化宽松的鸽派立场，以及其他主要经济体的扩张性政策，削弱了其对汇率的影响。 最近，英国投票“脱离”欧盟，在加上多家央行（包括日本银行）引入了负利率，对市场形成了冲击。 利用这一紧张情绪，对冲基金经理和其他投机者越来越多地下注于日元升值；事实上，芝加哥商业交易所（CME）对日元期货市场持仓量巨大。 在浮动汇率制度中，一国基于国内目标独立制定货币政策，并接受汇率结果。 但当汇率波动变得剧烈或反覆时，货币当局有权 — — 甚至有义务 — — 出手干预，平息波动。 日本当局似乎认识到了这一点 — — 在理论上。 8月18日，日本财务省、金融厅和日本银行开会讨论如何阻止日元升值。 会后，负责国际事务的副财务大臣浅川雅嗣（Masatsugu Asakawa）宣布财务省将在认定出现投机性汇率波动时迅速出手阻止。 此番宣告是为了敲山震虎。 但市场对此反应平淡，日元兑美元只波动了几个点位。 毕竟，财务省此前也发布过此类威胁 — — 比如在日本央行引入负利率政策之后，以及英国退出之后 — — 但从未执行。 就像“狼来了”的故事，财务省信誉尽失，至少在干预货币市场的威胁方面是如此。 因此，投机者仍然心安理得地单边押注 — — 要么大赚，要么打平手 — — 继续推高日元。 眼下，财务省的话已不足以震慑投机。 但财务省仍然犹犹豫豫，不兑现严厉的威胁，因为美国反对所谓的“货币操纵 ” 。 美国财政部和美联储高官积极地试图劝阻直接干预的支持者，包括我。 我只是提到了这个词，就遭到一位美国学者的愤怒反驳，好像我在说什么淫词秽语似的。 而美国官员强调，如果日本涉嫌操纵货币市场，美国国会就不会批准跨太平洋合作伙伴关系（TPP ） 。 有可能财务省将选择站在美国一边，继续对投机者进行空头威胁。 或者它将继续摇摆，直到错失动真格的时机。 不论哪种方法，都将导致同样的灾难：日元升值到危险水平，使安倍经济学失败。 财务省应该做的是勇敢地干预货币市场，阻止日元升值。 投机者将得到痛苦的教训，日本经济也可以重回正轨。 尽管日本可能因此成为TPP失败的替罪羊，但从当前美国政治气候看，该协议本来获得批准的希望就十分渺茫。 一个替代方案是日本银行购买外国证券。 许多对冲基金经理，以及以及一些经济学家，认为拯救日本经济于通缩的关键是更直接的直升机撒钱，将新印出来的现金直接给消费者。 但正是这批人通过押注日元升值阻止宏观经济政策生效。 唯有将投机者“斩于马下 ” ， 这一大胆 — — 并且高风险 — — 的货币政策才值得讨论。"

            "Asia’s Military Revolution SEOUL – A vast revolution in military affairs is taking place across East Asia. The latest signs are Chinese President Xi Jinping’s purge of General Xu Caihou, an ex-Politburo member and former vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission, on charges of corruption, and Japan’s “reinterpretation” of Article 9 of its constitution to permit the country to provide military aid to its allies. Despite the rising regional tensions that inspired these moves, China’s relations with its neighbors and the United States are not fated to lead to direct confrontation. But the relentless march of new initiatives to meet the perceived “China threat” will require the region’s political leaders, including the Chinese, to address their disputes in new and more creative ways if that outcome is to be avoided. In general, there are three ways to foster international peace: deepening economic interdependence, promoting democracy, and building international institutions. Unfortunately, because East Asia’s political leaders have failed to pursue the latter objective, they now find themselves playing dangerous balance-of-power games reminiscent of Europe a century ago. Deepening economic interdependence in the wake of Asia’s 1997 financial crisis has not generated political momentum for peace and cooperation. The region’s business leaders have been unable to prevent deteriorating foreign relations from harming their interests. By contrast, military lobbying now deeply influences foreign and defense policies – witness China’s double-digit increase in defense spending and rising US arms sales in the region. What explains this failure? International-relations theorists since Immanuel Kant have held that democracies rarely (if ever) fight one another; as a result, political leaders, such as US President Woodrow Wilson, have tried to promote democracy as a means to spread peace. Until recently, the US seemed to have assumed that China’s engagement with Western democracies would bolster peaceful ties. But, since the 2008 financial crisis, China’s confidence in its authoritarian development model has grown stronger. Its leaders now increasingly appear to believe that a new “Beijing Consensus” of mercantilism and state intervention has replaced the old “Washington Consensus” of free trade and deregulation. China’s ideological incompatibility with the US thus is making the shift in their relative power difficult to achieve peacefully. In the late nineteenth century, a rising US was able to cooperate with a declining Britain, owing to their shared culture and values. China’s leaders, however, tend to suspect that the US is deliberately trying to undermine their country’s political stability by questioning its record on human rights and political freedoms. Meanwhile, Xi’s domestic policies seem to be taking the country ever further from Western norms. It is this ideological divide that is undermining the development in East Asia of institutions that establish principles, rules, and decision-making procedures for the region. While much of the West is bound together by institutions like the Organization for Security Cooperation in Europe and NATO, East Asia’s main body, the ASEAN Regional Forum, is too weak to play an analogous role, leaving the region beset with unregulated rivalries. So far, US and East Asian leaders have done little beyond offering rhetorical support for the creation of multilateral security institutions. With the exception of the almost defunct six-party talks aimed at eliminating the nuclear threat posed by North Korea, Asia’s powers refuse to be constrained by international rules or norms. Instead, East Asia’s leaders resort to realpolitik. Unfortunately, unlike Europe’s nineteenth-century political masterminds – figures like Talleyrand, Metternich, Bismarck, and Disraeli – who crafted durable international alliances, Asia lacks leaders willing and able to look beyond their narrow national interests. For example, China’s leaders seem to believe that the 2008 economic crisis and the high costs of two foreign wars have left the US in no position to exercise international leadership. That may explain China’s recent foreign-policy assertiveness, particularly in its dispute with Japan over control of the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands, which could be intended to probe the strength of the US-Japan alliance. Testing US power in this way could prove to be a dangerous miscalculation. Though weakened economically, the US remains a military superpower. Its interests in East Asia date back to the late nineteenth century. Just as Britain refused to concede naval supremacy to Germany a century ago, the US will not easily accept any Chinese challenge to its strategic position in the western Pacific, especially given that so many East Asian states are pleading for US protection. China and the US need to talk. Despite their economic interdependence and some 90 inter-governmental channels for bilateral dialogue, the two superpowers are caught in a perilous tug-of-war over interests in the East and South China Seas and the western Pacific. Sino-Japanese relations are particularly fraught, with two decades of economic stagnation in Japan and rapid growth in China fueling nationalist overreaction on both sides. Having become accustomed to outsourcing its security to the US, and despite having the world’s third-largest economy, Japan neglected to develop its own constructive diplomatic vision. It remains to be seen whether Abe’s constitutional reinterpretation, cloaked in the language of regional cooperation, advances such a new vision. It does not help that the US wants Japan to shoulder more of the burden of maintaining Asia’s security, a position that may make sense strategically and financially, but that betrays a lack of understanding of the political context. The US seems to underestimate regional concerns over Japan’s potential remilitarization. By providing Japan with a diplomatic carte blanche, the US may find itself hostage to Japanese interests, with the result that Japan becomes part of Asia’s security problem, not part of its solution. Asia-Pacific leaders must shake off their complacency. Serious efforts and far-reaching compromises are needed to begin the process of building institutions for regional security cooperation. Otherwise, the much-heralded “Asian century,” far from bringing economic prosperity and peace, will be an age of suspicion and peril.",
            "亚洲军事革命 首尔—一场军事事务大革命正在东亚展开。 最新信号包括中国国家主席习近平以腐败罪名清洗前政治局委员、中央军委副主席徐才厚上将，以及日本“重新解释”其宪法第九条，允许日本为盟国提供军事援助。 尽管升级的地区紧张局势刺激了这些动作，但中国与邻国和美国的关系并未恶化到产生直接冲突的程度。 但不断地采取新措施以至于产生“中国威胁”论需要地区政治领导人（包括中国）用更新、更有创造力的方式解决争端，否则难以避免直接冲突。 总体而言，有三种方式构建国际和平：深化经济相互依存、推进民主，以及建立国际机构。 不幸的是，由于东亚政治领导人在最后一个目标上已经失败，因此现在已经陷入了与一个世界前的欧洲十分相似的危险的实力平衡博弈。 1997年亚洲金融危机所带来的经济相互依存深化并未产生和平与合作的政治动力。 东亚商业领袖一直无法避免外交关系恶化影响自身利益。 相反，军事游说目前深刻地影响着外交和国防政策 — — 中国以两位数增长的国防支出和节节攀升的美国东亚地区军售就是明证。 这一失败的原因何在？ 自康德以来的国际关系理论家都认为，民主国家间很少互相开战；因此，政治领导人，如美国总统威尔逊，试图通过推进民主作为扩大和平的途径。 直到最近，美国似乎一直都认为中国加入西方民主阵营能推动和平关系。 但是，自2008年金融危机以来，中国对其集权发展模式的信心日益高涨。 中国领导人现在日益相信，强调重商主义和国家干预的新的“北京共识”已经取代了强调自由贸易和去监管的旧的“华盛顿共识 ” 。 因此，中国与美国的意识形态不相容决定了它们相对实力的变化难以以和平方式实现。 19世纪末，崛起的美国能够与衰落的英国合作，这是因为它们有共同的文化和价值。 但是，中国领导人向来怀疑美国在通过质疑中国人权和政治自由状况处心积虑破坏中国的政治稳定。 与此同时，习近平的国内政策也让中国与西方范式渐行渐远。 这一意识形态分歧破坏了东亚的机构建设，导致没有形成制定原则、规则和决策流程的地区机构。 大部分西方国家通过欧安组织和北约等机构而联系在一起，但东亚的主要机构 — — 东盟地区论坛太软弱，无法起到类似的作用，这使得东亚陷入了不受约束的对峙状态。 目前，美国和东亚领导人采取的措施无非是口头支持建立多边安全机构。 除了濒死的六方会谈（旨在消除朝鲜带来的核威胁 ） ， 亚洲大国拒绝受到国际规则或范式的约束。 相反，东亚领导人转向了现实政治。 ��幸的是，与塔列朗（Talleyrand ） 、 梅特涅（Metternich ） 、 俾斯麦（Bismarck）和迪斯累利（Disraeli）等创造了持久国际联盟的19世纪欧洲政治家不同，亚洲缺少愿意也能够让目光超越狭隘国家利益的领导人。 比如，中国领导人似乎认为2008年经济危机和两场海外战争的巨大代价意味着美国已不再能够行使国际领导力。 这或许能够解释中国最近的激进外交政策，特别是在钓鱼岛控制权问题上与日本的争端，这也许是意在探测美日同盟的坚固程度。 以这种方式试探美国的实力或许是危险的误判。 尽管经济颓势尽露，美国仍是军事超级大国。 其对东亚的兴趣可以追溯到19世纪末。 正如一个世纪前英国拒绝将海军霸权拱手让给德国，美国也不会轻易接受中国对其西太平洋战略地位的挑战，特别是考虑到大量东亚国家都要仰仗美国的保护。 中国和美国需要谈判。 尽管两国经济需要互相依存，并且两国间存在大约90条政府双边对话渠道，但这两个超级大国在东海和南海以及西太平洋利益上陷入了危险的角力。 中日关系尤其令人担心，日本二十年的经济停滞和中国二十年的快速增长加剧了双方民族主义热情高企。 日本早已习惯将安全外包给美国，尽管其经济规模位居世界第三，但仍没有发展出其自身的建设性外交愿景。 安倍披着地区合作外衣的修宪是否标志着日本有了新外教愿景还有待观察。 日本希望日本承担更多的维持亚洲安全的责任，这无济于事，让日本扮演这一角色或许在战略和金融上有意义，但也暴露出缺少对政治环境的理解。 美国似乎低估了东亚地区对日本军国主义死灰复燃的担忧。 美国可能最终会发现，向日本发放外交委任状让自己站在了日本利益的对立面，其后果将是日本成为亚洲安全问题而不是解决办法的一部分。 亚太领导人必须摆脱自满情绪。 要想开启地区安全合作机构的建设，就需要严肃动作和深刻妥协。 否则，近期大热的“亚洲世纪”带来的将绝非经济繁荣与和平，而是怀疑和冒险的时代。"

            "Are the Kids Leaning Right? NEW YORK – For decades, young people’s leftward leanings were considered an iron law of politics. “If people are not conservative at 40, they have no head,” Winston Churchill probably never said, “but if they are not liberal at 20, they have no heart.” From John F. Kennedy, Bill Clinton, and Tony Blair to Barack Obama and Jacinda Ardern, the leading lights of the left have regularly built political careers on the promise of youthful progressivism. This pattern is so culturally ingrained that it is largely taken for granted. But electoral outcomes in many Western democracies have begun to suggest a very different dynamic. In the first round of the French presidential elections this month, Emmanuel Macron achieved only a narrow victory (27.85%) over the right-wing populist Marine le Pen (23.15%). His success was based not so much on the fervor of the young as on the caution – and alarm – of older voters. Post-election studies show that Macron carried only one age group comfortably: voters aged 65 and older. Le Pen outperformed him among those aged 25-49. And while the far-left candidate, Jean-Luc Mélenchon, gained slightly more than one-third of the youth vote, Le Pen and the other far-right candidate, Éric Zemmour, received the combined support of an unprecedented 22% of first-time voters. Among voters between the ages of 25 and 34, the far right’s support increased to more than 35%. In France, it seems, the kids are not d’accord. A similar trend appears to be unfolding across southern Europe, with young voters in Italy and Spain also tilting dramatically to the right. Vox, the Spanish right-wing populist party, has quickly emerged as the country’s third-largest political force, owing to the support it has received not so much from stereotypical stick-in-the-mud septuagenarians as from disgruntled, predominantly male, and less educated younger voters. In Italy, more than half of young voters currently support right-wing parties such as Fratelli d’Italia, former Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini’s party, Lega, and former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi’s party, Forza Italia. Even in affluent Sweden and Germany, young voters’ natural alignment with progressive parties seems to be ending. Recent polls in Sweden show “no clear differences in terms of age” among those supporting the far-right Sweden Democrats, meaning that younger voters are as likely as older ones to cast a ballot for the party. While the Sweden Democrats have always had their share of mainly young male voters, their support among voters aged 18-24 increased from 7% in 2014 to 11.8% in November 2021. Similarly, in Germany’s federal elections last year, the pro-business Free Democratic Party was the surprising top choice for first-time voters, even beating out the Greens. And in recent state elections in eastern Germany, the far-right Alternative für Deutschland gained unparalleled support from young people. In Saxony-Anhalt, the party gained the largest share of votes among the under-30s, as well as among those aged 30-44. The question now is whether a similar trend will continue in Germany’s most populous state, North Rhine-Westphalia, when it holds elections in May. To be sure, this pattern of young people turning away from the left is not universal – yet. In the United Kingdom and the United States, younger voters remain committed to progressive parties overall. The Democrats are expected to keep a firm hold on younger voters in the US midterm elections this fall. Whereas half of voters aged 65 and older support the Republican candidate in their respective district, this level drops to a mere 29% among voters under 30. Younger American voters’ enduring alliance with the Democrats may be due in part to policies specifically tailored to their economic interests. Leading Democratic politicians have run on proposals to cancel student debt and pursue more robust forms of redistribution to reduce economic inequality. But while progressive parties around the world should take note of this achievement, that doesn’t mean they can ignore the lessons from recent elections elsewhere. Although progressives still generally outperform the right in many Western democracies, the momentum is shifting. Current trends are a stark reminder that success at the polls is not demographically predetermined. Like their older counterparts, young voters will ultimately support the candidates who offer convincing solutions to the problems that are most pressing in their own lives. If progressive political movements fail to meet this basic condition, they may well lose their longstanding advantage among this electoral cohort. The notion that young people will always go for progressives will become a myth, rather than a reliable model.",
            "孩子们是否正在右倾？ 纽约—数十年来，年轻人的左倾倾向被视为政治铁律。 “如果人到40岁还不保守，那他就没有头脑 ， ” 温斯顿·丘吉尔很有可能从未说过 ， “ 但如果他们在20岁时不崇尚自由，他们就没有心 。 ” 从约翰·F·肯尼迪、比尔·克林顿、 托尼·布莱尔到巴拉克·奥巴马和杰辛达·阿德恩，左翼领军人物的政治生涯经常以年轻人的进步主义思想为基础。 这种模式在文化上如此根深蒂固，以至于在很大程度上被人们视为理所当然。 但许多西方民主国家的选举结果已经开始表现出截然不同的趋势。 在本月首轮法国总统大选中，伊曼纽尔·马克龙仅以微弱优势（27.85 % ） 击败了右翼民粹主义者玛琳·勒庞（23.15 % ） 。 与其说是年轻人的热情造就了他的成功，还不如说是年龄较长选民的警惕和谨慎。 后选举研究结果表明，马克龙仅轻松赢得了一个年龄组：那就是65岁及以上的选民。 在25~49岁年龄组的选民中，勒庞的表现优于马克龙。 虽然极左翼候选人让-吕克·梅朗雄获得了略多于1/3的青年选票，但勒庞和另一位极右翼候选人埃里克·泽穆尔加在一起却前所未有地获得了22%的首次投票选民的支持。 极右翼在25~34岁年龄组选民投票中，支持率增加到35%以上。 在法国，年轻人似乎并不和谐。 类似的趋势似乎也正在席卷整个南欧，意大利和西班牙的年轻选民也正在急剧右倾。 西班牙右翼民粹主义政党声音党（VOX）迅速崛起为该国第三大政治力量，与其说支持他们的是老派、迟钝且年逾古稀选民，还不如说是以男性为主、心怀不满且教育程度不高的年轻选民。 在意大利，目前有超过半数的年轻选民支持右翼党派，如意大利兄弟会、前副总理马泰奥·萨尔维尼的北方联盟党（Lega）和前总理西尔维奥·贝卢斯科尼的意大利力量党。 即使是在富裕的瑞典和德国，年轻选民与进步政党的天然联盟似乎也正走向终结。 瑞典最近的民调结果显示，极右翼瑞典民主党的支持“在年龄方面并没有明显差异 ， ” 也就是说，年轻选民为该党投票的几率并不比年长选民更低。 尽管瑞典民主党的支持者一直以男性选民为主，但其在18~24岁选民中的支持率于2021年11月增加到11.8 % ， 而该数据在2014年则仅有7 % 。 同样，在德国去年举行的联盟选举中，亲商界的自由民主党甚至击败绿党，出人意料地成为首次投票选民的首选。 而在德国东部不久前进行的州选举中，极右翼的德国另类选择党赢得了年轻人的空前支持 。 在萨克森-安哈尔特州，30岁以下选民、以及30~44岁年龄组选民为该党提供了最大份额的支持。 现在的问题是，今年5月，当德国人口最多的北莱茵-威斯特法伦州进行选举时，类似的趋势是否将会持续。 可以肯定，这种年轻人背离左派的模式目前仍尚不普及。 在英国和美国，就总体而言，进步政党仍然拥有年轻选民的支持。 人们预期民主党将在今年秋天进行的美国中期选举中牢牢控制住年轻选民。 尽管65岁及以上选民中半数支持各自选区的共和党候选人，但30岁以下选民仅有29%支持共和党候选人。 为满足美国年轻选民经济利益而量身定制的政策可能部分解释了他们与共和党人的长期联盟。 领先的民主党政治家已经提出了取消学生债和采用更强有力的再分配形式以减轻经济不平等的参选提议。 尽管世界各地的进步政党均应注意到上述成就，但这并不意味着，他们可以忽视其他地方近期选举的教训。 尽管进步党派在许多西方民主国家的表现仍普遍优于右翼政党，但趋势正在逆转之中。 当前的趋势明确提醒人们，人口统计数据并不能预先决定民调是否成功。 与年长选民一样，年轻选民最终将支持那些能为自身生活中最紧迫问题提供令人信服解决方案的候选人。 如果进一步政治运动满足不了这个基本条件，他们在相关选举群体中所享有的长期优势很有可能会丧失。 年轻人永远追求进步的观点将会成为一种神话，而不是一种可靠的模式。"

            "Mobilizing Young People Against Anti-Vaxxers BRUSSELS – Measles is back. Reported cases of the disease – which had virtually disappeared for decades – have spiked in Europe and the United States, with 110,000 deaths worldwide in 2017. Deliberately unvaccinated children are the main victims of this epidemic – and the primary cause. Anti-vaccine activism has been around as long as vaccination itself. But it has surged since 1998, when, in a landmark case of medical “fake news,” Andrew Wakefield and his co-authors published a paper in The Lancet, a leading medical journal,asserting that they had found a link between the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine and autism. A thorough investigation subsequently revealed that the paper was entirely bogus. Unfortunately, by the time The Lancet retracted the paper in 2010, it had breathed new life into the anti-vaccine movement, fueling rising mistrust of the MMR vaccine and declining vaccine uptake. The backlash was not limited to the MMR vaccine. Unsubstantiated claims about the supposedly malign effects of other vaccines began to circulate on websites, blogs, and social networks. For many, those claims carried more weight than scientific evidence, medical experts’ advice, or public-health authorities’ recommendations, which anti-vaccine activists insist are distorted by conflicts of interest, despite strict rules on the subject. The gaps in vaccine coverage that have resulted are taking a serious toll. Vaccine coverage is now insufficient in the US and many European countries to support so-called herd immunity, which is achieved when a large enough share of the population is vaccinated – over 90% in the case of the measles virus – to disrupt the chain of transmission. Herd immunity protects those who are not yet vaccinated or cannot be immunized for sound medical reasons – say, because they are immunocompromised. In this sense, vaccination is about more than individual welfare; it is an act of social solidarity. That is why a growing number of governments are devising ways to induce parents to vaccinate their children. Already, several US states and European countries – including, most recently, Italy and France – have enacted laws making several vaccines compulsory and prohibiting unvaccinated children from being enrolled in preschool and childcare centers. Australia has taken this a step further. On top of its “no jab, no play” policy of keeping unvaccinated kids out of preschool and childcare, it has implemented a “no jab, no pay” policy of withholding child benefits from parents who do not vaccinate their kids. The policy is strictly enforced; there are no exemptions for families who object to vaccination on philosophical or religious grounds. The financial incentive has boosted vaccination rates but only modestly. From December 2015 (after the policy was introduced) to March 2017, the immunization rate for one-year-olds increased by around one percentage point. But with thousands of children remaining unvaccinated, even as their parents have had their government benefits reduced, it seems clear that mandatory vaccination will not be enough to restore and maintain vaccine coverage in the long term. The key lies in education, particularly of young people. Education programs on the benefits of immunization typically target parents and health professionals. But young people can play a pivotal role in reversing the shift away from vaccination. Discussions about the uptake of the vaccine for human papillomavirus (HPV) – the most prevalent sexually transmitted disease – may provide an important opportunity. Usually acquired during adolescence or early adulthood, HPV is responsible for most cervical tumors in women and many oropharyngeal tumors in men. But, since 2006, there has been safe and efficient HPV vaccines that could avert more than 300,000 cancer deaths each year. HPV vaccines are currently recommended for administration in preadolescent girls and boys. But the global HPV immunization rate is insufficient to ensure herd immunity, owing to resistance among parents. That is why education should also target young adolescents, who can thus be empowered to become vaccine advocates. Young adolescents are well able to understand the importance of the HPV vaccination for themselves, their sexual partners, and their community. In fact, this is the period of a person’s life when beliefs and attitudes toward health issues are formed. They just need accurate information delivered effectively, through educational programs that go beyond school-based teaching methods to take advantage of comics, game-based learning tools, social media, and other digital technologies. In order to be credible and efficient, these initiatives must be kept independent from vaccine manufacturers and lobbies. Giving young people incentives to make informed decisions and discuss the HPV vaccine with their parents could lead to broader acceptance of other life-saving immunizations. Because the effectiveness of immunization programs is a key determinant of health, such a shift would be a public-health coup. In the fight for climate action or, in the US, gun control, youth movements are already changing mindsets and shaping political agendas. Now is the time to mobilize youth to overcome resistance to vaccination as well, so that we can leave diseases like measles in the past, where they belong.",
            "动员年轻人反对反疫苗运动 布鲁塞尔 — — 麻疹再度回归。 据报，在欧洲和美国几乎已经消失数十年的麻疹病例激增，仅2017年全球就有高达110，000死亡病例。 故意不接种疫苗的儿童是此次流行病的主要受害者 — — 同时也是造成麻疹流行的主要原因。 反疫苗主义的历史就像疫苗本身一样悠久。 但自1998年来，反疫苗情绪迅速上升，当时，在一次颇具里程碑意义的医学“假新闻”案件中，安德鲁·维克菲尔德及其合著者在著名医学期刊柳叶刀杂志上发布了一篇论文，声称他们发现了麻疹、腮腺炎和风疹疫苗（MMR）有可能诱发自闭症。 随后一项全面调查显示，上述论文纯属伪造。 但不幸的是，截止2010年柳叶刀杂志撤回该论文时，它已经为反疫苗运动注入了新的活力，助长了人们对麻疹、腮腺炎和风疹疫苗日益加深的不信任，从而导致疫苗注射量显著降低。 人们不仅反对麻疹、腮腺炎和风疹疫苗。 有关其他疫苗可能产生不良影响的未经证实的说法开始在网站、博客和社交网络上流行。 对许多人而言，这些说法比科学证据、医学专家建议或公共卫生当局的推荐更为重要，因为反疫苗活动人士坚持认为，尽管在此问题上存在严格立法，但上述机构的观点已经被利益冲突所扭曲。 由此所导致的疫苗覆盖缺口后果非常严重。 目前美国和许多欧洲国家的疫苗覆盖已经不足以支持所谓的群体免疫，而群体免疫只有在足够大比例的人口 — — 以麻疹病毒为例要达到90%以上 — — 均接种疫苗，从而破坏病毒的传播链时才能成为可能。 群体免疫能够保护那些尚未接种疫苗者，也可以保护那些因为合理的医疗原因 — — 比如因为免疫功能受到损害 — — 而不能接种疫苗的人。 从这个意义上讲，疫苗接种不仅限于个人福利；而是一种社会团结行为。 这解释了为什么越来越多的政府正在想方设法促使父母为子女进行疫苗接种。 若干美国州和欧洲国家 — — 包括最新加入的法国和意大利 — — 已经颁布法律，强制接种若干疫苗，并且禁止未接种儿童进入学前班和儿童保育中心。 澳大利亚已经采取了更进一步的措施。 除去禁止未接种儿童进入学前班和儿童保育中心的“不注射，不入园”政策外，该国还实施了一项“不注射，不付款”政策，禁止不为子女注射疫苗的父母领取儿童福利。 这项政策得到了严格的执行；这项政策并不豁免那些因哲学或宗教原因而反对疫苗接种的家庭。 这项财政政策仅仅是温和地提高了疫苗接种率。 从2015年12月（该政策出台后）到2017年3月，一岁儿童的免疫率提高了近1 % 。 但因为即使在削减其父母政府福利的情况下仍有数千名儿童尚未接种，显然强制疫苗接种举措并不足以恢复并维持长期的疫苗覆盖率。 教育才是真正的关键，尤其是对年轻人的教育。 有关免疫益处的教育计划通常针对家长和卫生专业人士。 但年轻人可以在逆转抗拒免疫接种的潮流中发挥关键作用。 有关人类乳头瘤病毒（HPV ） — —也就是最常见的性传播疾病 — — 接种的讨论活动可能代表着一个重要的机会。 通常在青春期或成年初期感染的人类乳头瘤病毒是诱发女性宫颈癌和男性口咽癌的主要原因。 但自2006年来，已经出现了安全和有效的人类乳头瘤病毒疫苗，每年可避免超过300，000人死于癌症。 人类乳头瘤病毒疫苗目前被推荐给青春期前的女孩和男孩接种。 但由于家长的抵制，全球人类乳头瘤病毒免疫率并不足以保障群体免疫。 这解释了为什么教育同样应当针对青年一代，接受过疫苗教育的年轻人可以承担起宣传疫苗接种的重任。 花季青少年能够很好地理解人类乳头瘤病毒免疫接种对其自身、性伴侣及群体的重要性。 事实上，人一生中针对健康问题的信念和态度恰恰在此期间形成。 他们仅仅需要通过教育计划有效传递准确的信息，上述教育计划不能仅仅限于学校教学的方法，还必须利用漫画、以游戏为基础的工具、社交媒体和其他数字技术等各式工具。 为确保可信度和效率，上述举措必须独立于疫苗生产厂商和游说团体。 鼓励年轻人与父母探讨人类乳头瘤病毒疫苗并作出明智的决定可能会导致更多人接受其他能挽救生命的疫苗接种。 因为免疫计划有效性是健康的关键决定要素，这样一种转变可能成就一次对公共卫生的冲击。 在针对气候变化，或者在美国，针对枪支管控的斗争中，青少年运动已经在改变人们的思维和政治议程。 现在是时候动员年轻人克服对疫苗接种的抵制，这样我们才能将麻疹等疾病留在它们本应属于的过去。"

            "The Politics of Young and Old PARIS – If one considers some of today’s main challenges – including climate change, pensions, public debt, and the labor market – an obvious conclusion emerges: It is relatively much worse to be young today than it was a quarter-century ago. Yet in most countries, the generational dimension is remarkably absent from the political debate. Fifty years ago, people spoke often, and loudly, of a “generation gap.” Today, that gap has become invisible. This is bad for the young, for democracy, and for social justice. Start with climate change. Its containment requires changing habits and investing in emission reductions so that future generations will have a habitable planet. The alarm bell was first rung in 1992 at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro; but over the last generation, little was done to contain emissions. And progress following the landmark agreement achieved in Paris in December is unlikely to be fast, because the accord is premised on postponing major efforts. Universal assent was made possible only by further delaying. Given the massive inertia inherent in the greenhouse effect, the gap between responsible and irresponsible behavior will start resulting in different temperatures only in a quarter-century, and major consequences will follow only in 50 years. Anyone older than 60 today will hardly notice the difference between the two scenarios. But the fate of most citizens currently younger than 30 will be fundamentally affected. In due course, the respite gained by the older generations will have to be paid for by the younger ones. Now consider debt. Since 1990, public debt has increased by about 40 percentage points of GDP in the European Union and the United States (and much more in Japan). Given near-zero interest rates, the corresponding drag on income is currently low; but, because inflation is virtually inexistent and growth is anemic, the debt ratios have only stabilized. So debt reduction will take longer than expected in the aftermath of the global crisis, which will deprive the coming generations of the fiscal space they might need to invest in climate action or in the containment of security threats. Future pensions represent another form of debt. The pay-as-you-go (PAYG) systems in place in many countries are giant intergenerational transfer schemes. True, everyone is expected to contribute while they work, before becoming a recipient in retirement. In an ideal steady state, pension regimes would not redistribute income across cohorts born at different points in time. As specialists say, they would be generationally neutral. But the baby boomers (those born from the mid-1940s to the mid-1960s) paid little into the PAYG schemes because economic growth, population size, and their parents’ low life expectancy made financing pensions easy. All these factors have now gone into reverse: Growth has slowed, the baby boomers are a demographic bulge weighing on their children, and they are expected to live long. Countries where pension reforms were introduced early have been able to limit the resulting burden on the young and keep the balance between generations approximately fair. But countries where reforms were delayed have allowed that balance to place the young at a disadvantage. Finally, consider the labor market. Over the last decade, conditions for new entrants have worsened markedly in many countries. The number of young people categorized as NEET (neither in employment nor in education or training) currently stands at 10.2 million in the US and 14 million in the EU. Furthermore, many of those who have recently entered the labor market have suffered from job insecurity and repeated spells of unemployment. In continental Europe, especially, young workers are the first to suffer from economic downturns. On all of these issues – climate, debt, pensions, and jobs – the younger generations have been made relatively worse off by developments over the last quarter-century. A telling symbol is that there is often more poverty among the young than among the elderly. This ought to be a major political issue, with significant implications for public finances, social protection, tax policy, and labor market regulation. And it reinforces the imperative of reviving growth through productivity-boosting policies. Yet the new generation gap has had little direct political effect. It hardly arises in electoral debate and has generally not led to the emergence of new parties or movements. Instead, the generational divide shows up in electoral participation. In the latest US mid-term elections, the turnout rate among younger citizens was less than 20%, compared to more than 50% for senior voters. Similar trends are observable in other countries. Despite the increased uncertainty they face, younger citizens are much more disengaged from electoral politics than their parents and grandparents were at the same age. This generational gap in electoral participation explains why politicians care more about the elderly than about the young. But in aging societies, the more the young abstain from voting, the more decisions by parliaments and governments will be biased against their interests. True, parents are generally not selfish. They help their children through private transfers and grants. But only those with income and wealth can provide meaningful support. The result of neglecting young people collectively while supporting them privately is social inequality on a massive scale. How to redress generational biases in the political system is a key question for all democracies. Solutions do exist: mandatory voting, term limits for elected officials, and youth parliaments or special bodies to examine intergenerational issues, for example. But such measures are either difficult to implement or only moderately effective in view of the magnitude of the challenges. Current trends are clearly unsustainable politically and socially. What is unclear is when and how young people will recognize that and make themselves heard.",
            "青年和老人的政治 巴黎 — — 如果深入思考气候变化、养老金、公共债务和劳动力市场等当今世界某些主要挑战，人们可以显而易见地得出结论：今天年轻人的处境远逊于四分之一世纪以前。 但在多数国家，代际问题却在政治辩论中踪影不见。 50年前，人们往往公开谈论“代沟 ” 。 而今天，人们对代沟问题的讨论却已十分罕见。 这对年轻人、民主政体和社会公平而言都不是好现象。 先来说气候变化。 遏制气候变化需要改变习惯、投资减排，以便留给后代一个可以居住的星球。 1992年召开的里约热内卢地球峰会首次敲响了警钟；但过去这代人却鲜有减排的举措。 而且因为以推迟重大努力为前提，12月巴黎协议达成后也不太可能很快取得进展。 达成普遍一致仅仅是因为进一步的拖延。 鉴于温室效应所固有的巨大惯性，负责和不负责行为所导致的温差将在25年后才得以显现，而产生重大后果则需要50年。 今天60岁以上的人很可能不会注意到两者之间的差距。 但多数目前还在30岁以下的民众其命运将会遭到根本性的改变。 总有一天，年轻一代将为老一代的喘息之机付出代价。 再来说说债务问题。 自20世纪90年代以来，欧盟和美国（其实日本更甚）的公共债务占GDP之比提高了约40个百分点。 鉴于利率接近于零，债务增加目前对收入造成的拖累不大；但因为通胀近乎为零且增长萎靡不振，造成负债率基本稳定下来。 因此全球危机后需要更长的时间来削减债务，从而剥夺了子孙后代投资气候行动或遏制安全威胁所需的财政空间。 未来养老金支出其实是另一种形式的债务。 很多国家实行的现收现付制度都是规模巨大的代际转移方案。 诚然，在成为养老金的领取者之前，每个人在工作期间都会为之做出贡献。 在理想的稳定状态下，养老金制度不会在不同时间出生的群体间造成收入再分配。 正如专家所言，养老制度的代际影响基本为中性。 但（20世纪40到60年代中期出生的）婴儿潮一代对现收现付制度所做的贡献有限，因为经济增长、人口规模及其父母较低的预期寿命降低了养老金的筹措难度。 现在一切因素都已经出现了逆转：增长开始放缓、绝对数量庞大的婴儿潮一代为子女造成了沉重的负担，而且他们拥有相当长的预期寿命。 那些较早推行养老金改革的国家勉强能够限制年轻人所承受的���担，从而实现代际负担的相对平衡。 但那些推迟改革的国家却已坐视年轻人陷入到相当不利的境地。 最后，再来看劳动力市场。 过去十年，很多国家新进劳动力面临的条件显著恶化。 被称之为NEET（即既未就业也未接受教育或培训）的年轻一族在美国有1020万 、欧盟则有1400万。 此外，很多新进劳力动都面临着缺乏就业安全和反复失业的境况。 在欧洲大陆，也是年轻劳动者最先尝到经济衰退之苦。 在气候、债务、养老金和就业等所有问题上，过去四分之一世纪的发展只是让年轻人的处境进一步恶化。 一个生动的标志是年轻人中的贫困人数比老年人更多。 这本来应该成为重大政治问题，对公共财政、社会保障、税收政策和劳动力市场监管都产生显著的影响，并且刻不容缓地促使领导人推进通过提高生产率恢复经济的举措。 但新生代差异却几乎没有造成任何直接的政治影响。 它几乎没有在选举辩论中出现，总体而言也没有导致产生新的运动和政党。 相反，在选举参与度方面却明显体现出两代人的不同。 在最新的美国中期选举中，年轻民众的投票率低于20 % ， 而老年公民却在50%以上。 类似的趋势也能在其他国家观察到。 尽管所面临的不确定性增加，但年轻人较之其父辈和祖父辈同龄时参与选举政治的意愿却显著下降。 选举参与度方面的代沟解释了政治家为什么关心老年人比年轻人更多。 但是在老龄化社会，年轻人越不愿投票，议会和政府的决策对其利益的考虑也就越少。 诚然，父母一般都非常无私。 他们会通过私人转移和赠与等方式来帮助自己的子女。 但只有那些拥有收入和财富者才能提供有意义的支持。 忽视年轻人群体利益而私下为其提供支持必然导致大规模社会不平等。 如何纠正代际偏见是所有民主国家政治体系的关键问题。 的确存在解决方案：比方说强制投票、当选官员任期限制、青年议会或研究代际问题的专门机构。 但这些举措要么难以实施、要么考虑到挑战的规模其效果非常有限。 目前的趋势显然在政治和社会方面是不可持续的。 但我们尚不清楚年轻人会在何时以及以何种方式认识到这个问题，并让自己的意见被全社会听到。"

            "Your Genes or Mine, How Different Are We? For some time, scientists have believed that individual human beings were 99.9% genetically identical. The 0.1% of the genome that was different (approximately 3,000,000 bases of DNA) was comprised of “single nucleotide polymorphisms” (SNPs are alterations of the individual bases of DNA) scattered throughout the genome. It was thought that some of these DNA alterations may in part explain some of the physical differences that exist between two different, but otherwise normal individuals. In the summer of 2004, two groups of scientists working independently (one led by researchers at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston and the other led by researchers at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories) called this scientific dogma into question. Their research identified hundreds of regions of the human genome where the number of copies of a particular DNA segment varied from individual to individual. With only a few exceptions, all DNA segments were thought to exist in two copies (one copy inherited from your mother and one copy inherited from your father). Both studies showed that there are hundreds of regions of the genome that could have more or less than the expected two copies. This alerted scientists to the existence of a larger source of genetic variation than was previously understood, and forced us to speculate on the implications of this discovery. This discovery was made recently because until now, the technology was not available to comprehensively assess genomic imbalances in a genome-wide fashion. That has changed over the last five or six years, with the development of a technique known as “array-based comparative genomic hybridization” (array-CGH), revolutionizing genetic research and diagnostics. About three years ago at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, when we were seeking a potential tool for high-resolution diagnostics, array-CGH offered the hope of providing a reliable and efficient genome-wide test that could detect gains or losses in an unbiased and non-subjective fashion. When validation experiments were performed that compared the DNA from one “normal, healthy” individual with the DNA from another “normal, healthy” individual, we were astonished to find an average of 12 DNA fragments that showed copy number differences between the two individuals being compared. These became known as copy number variants, or CNVs. Combining the data from our study and the study from Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories, over 300 regions of the genome were found to exhibit CNVs among normal individuals. Since these two initial studies, many other groups, including ours, have confirmed and documented many more CNVs in other individuals studied. This is the goal of the Structural Genomic Variation Consortium’s Copy Number Variation Project, which aims at providing researchers the most comprehensive list and characterization of CNVs in humans. The Consortium recently assessed 270 individuals from four populations with ancestry in Africa, Asia or Europe (known as the HapMap collection) to construct a new map of the human genome. Using two complementary genome-wide technologies, with subsequent validation studies, a total of 1,447 CNVs were identified. The data clearly demonstrate that individuals are not as genetically similar as once thought. Many of the regions in which the CNVs were identified overlapped known disease genes. Since they are being identified in normal individuals, CNVs may not necessarily be a direct cause of human disease, but many may confer susceptibility to certain diseases, serve as disease markers, and/or indicate potential regions of genomic instability. Some CNVs are also associated with genes involved in immune response and detoxification-related metabolism (some of the human body’s reactions to the environment that we live in). Indeed, some CNVs may turn out to explain why some people react differently to specific medications. Hopefully, a more comprehensive understanding of human genetic variation (i.e. single base pair changes and structural genomic variation, such as CNVs) will ultimately help physicians to prescribe medication in a more individualized manner, that would result in maximum therapeutic effects to each patient, with minimal side effects. Overall, we anticipate that many of these CNVs will provide explanations to how we adapt and interact with our ever-changing environment. Indeed, as studies continue to identify and characterize CNVs, we anticipate achieving a better understanding of the relationship between these genetic variations, complex diseases, and human adaptability.",
            "你我的基因，我们有何不同？ 曾经有一段时间，科学家们认为人类单个个体99.9%的基因都是相同的。 另外不同的0.1 % （ 大约为3, 000,000个碱基）是由散布于基因组的 “单核苷酸多态性”组成的（单核苷酸多态性即SNPs，为DNA单个碱基的改变 ） 。 这些DNA的改变被认为可以或多或少地解释两个不同的、普通个体之间存在的身体差异。 2004年的夏令时节，两个独立开展研究的科学家团体对这一科学教条提出了疑问。 （其中一个团体由哈佛医学院、伯明翰大学以及波士顿女子医院的研究者负责，另一个团体由冷泉港实验室的研究者负责 ） 。 他们的研究涉及到成百上千的人类基因区域，在这些区域，特殊DNA片断的组数因个体而不同。 除了少数几个例外，所有的DNA片断都被认为存在于两个基因组中（一个遗传于母亲，另一个遗传于父亲 ） 。 两份研究都显示在成百上千的基因区域中都有可能多于所认为的两个基因组。 这些科学家提出的存在更多基因差异来源的想法使我们对其相关性展开了想象。 这些探索是最近才开展的，原因是到目前为止，以整组基因的方式进行基因不平衡性全面评定的技术还达不到要求。 随着被称为“微矩阵列比较型基因杂交法 ” （ array-CGH）技术的开发，这种情况在过去的五到六年得到了改变。 该技术使得基因研究和诊断被彻底变革。 大致三年前在伯明翰大学和女子医院，在寻求高精诊断的有利工具时，array-CGH提供了可靠、有效的整组基因测试的希望，该测试可公正地找到得失。 在对两个“正常的、健康的”个体之间的DNA进行比较的有效试验时，我们惊奇地发现在所比较的两个个体中，平均存在12个显示组数差异的DNA片断。 这被称为组数差异（或CNVs ） 。 结合我方以及冷泉谷实验室的研究数据，我们发现在正常个体中，有超过300个基因区域存在CNVs。 伴随着这两份最初研究的开展 ，其它许多团体（包括我们）证实了其他个体中的CNVs现象。 这即是结构基因改变协会的组数改变项目的目标，旨在为研究者提供人类CNVs的最全面信息及说明。 该协会近期对来自四个种群的270个个体开展了评估（这些个体具有非洲、亚洲或欧洲的血统, 被称为抽样图谱集）以构建人类基因的新图谱。 通过使用两种互补的整组基因技术以及随后的有效研究，总计有1,447 份CNVs被识别。 该数据清楚地表明个体基因并不像以往所认为的是类似的。 许多CNVs被交叠识别的区域为疾病基因。 因为CNVs是在正常个体中被识别的，所以它们不是疾病的直接原因，但许多CNVs会造成对某些疾病的易感性，成为疾病的标志，并且/或者表明重要区域的基因不稳定性。 某些CNVs联合了免疫回应和解毒相关代谢（人类对所居住环境的一些反应）中的基因。 事实上，某些CNVs可以解释为什么一些人对某些药品的反应各异。 对人类基因改变（比如单碱基对改变和结构性基因改变，如CNVs）更全面的了解有望帮助医生在开药时考虑到个体差异性，这将带来对病人最好的治疗效果，而使副作用降到最小限度。 总之，我们可以预想CNVs能够解释我们如何适应并与不断改变的环境的互相作用。 基于对CNVs 的识别和特性的更多研究，我们可以预想到更多地了解基因改变、疑难杂症和人类适应性之间的关系。"

            "Unburdening the Facebook Generation LOS ANGELES – Once again, young people have gotten the short end of the political stick. The outcome of the United Kingdom’s Brexit referendum is but another reminder of a yawning generational divide that cuts across political affiliation, income levels, and race. Almost 75% of UK voters aged 18-24 voted to “Remain” in the European Union, only to have “Leave” imposed on them by older voters. And this is just one of several ways in which millennials’ economic future, and that of their children, is being determined by others. I am in my late fifties, and I worry that our generation in the advanced world will be remembered – to our shame and chagrin – as the one that lost the economic plot. In the run-up to the 2008 global financial crisis, we feasted on leverage, feeling increasingly entitled to use credit to live beyond our means and to assume too much speculative financial risk. We stopped investing in genuine engines of growth, letting our infrastructure decay, our education system lag, and our worker training and retooling programs erode. We allowed the budget to be taken hostage by special interests, which has resulted in a fragmentation of the tax system that, no surprise, has imparted yet another unfair anti-growth bias to the economic system. And we witnessed a dramatic worsening in inequality, not just of income and wealth, but also of opportunity. The 2008 crisis should have been our economic wake-up call. It wasn’t. Rather than using the crisis to catalyze change, we essentially rolled over and went back to doing more of the same. Specifically, we simply exchanged private factories of credit and leverage for public ones. We swapped an over-leveraged banking system for experimental liquidity injections by hyperactive monetary authorities. In the process, we overburdened central banks, risking their credibility and political autonomy, as well as future financial stability. Emerging from the crisis, we shifted private liabilities from banks’ balance sheets to taxpayers, including future ones, yet we failed to fix fully the bailed-out financial sector. We let inequality worsen, and stood by as too many young people in Europe languished in joblessness, risking a scary transition from unemployment to unemployability. In short, we didn’t do nearly enough to reinvigorate the engines of sustainable inclusive growth, thereby also weakening potential output and threatening future economic performance. And we are compounding these serial miscarriages with a grand failure to act on longer-term sustainability, particularly when it comes to the planet and social cohesion. Poor economics has naturally spilled over into messy politics, as growing segments of the population have lost trust in the political establishment, business elites, and expert opinion. The resulting political fragmentation, including the rise of fringe and anti-establishment movements, has made it even harder to devise more appropriate economic-policy responses. To add insult to injury, we are now permitting a regulatory backlash against technological innovations that disrupt entrenched and inefficient industries, and that provide people with greater control over their lives and wellbeing. Growing restrictions on companies such as Airbnb and Uber hit the young particularly hard, both as producers and as consumers. If we do not change course soon, subsequent generations will confront self-reinforcing economic, financial, and political tendencies that burden them with too little growth, too much debt, artificially inflated asset prices, and alarming levels of inequality and partisan political polarization. Fortunately, we are aware of the mounting problem, worried about its consequences, and have a good sense of how to bring about the much-needed pivot. Given the role of technological innovation, much of which is youth-led, even a small reorientation of policies could have a meaningful and rapid impact on the economy. Through a more comprehensive policy approach, we could turn a vicious cycle of economic stagnation, social immobility, and market volatility into a virtuous cycle of inclusive growth, genuine financial stability, and greater political coherence. What is needed, in particular, is simultaneous progress on pro-growth structural reforms, better demand management, addressing pockets of excessive indebtedness, and improving regional and global policy frameworks. While highly desirable, such changes will materialize only if greater constructive pressure is placed on politicians. Simply put, few politicians will champion changes that promise longer-term benefits but often come with short-term disruptions. And the older voters who back them will resist any meaningful erosion of their entitlements – even turning, when they perceive a threat to their interests, to populist politicians and dangerously simplistic solutions such as Brexit. Sadly, young people have been overly complacent when it comes to political participation, notably on matters that directly affect their wellbeing and that of their children. Yes, almost three-quarters of young voters backed the UK’s “Remain” campaign. But only a third of them turned out. In contrast, the participation rate for those over 65 was more than 80%. Undoubtedly, the absence of young people at the polls left the decision in the hands of older people, whose preferences and motivations differ, even if innocently. Millennials have impressively gained a greater say in how they communicate, travel, source and disseminate information, pool their resources, interact with businesses, and much else. Now they must seek a greater say in electing their political representatives and in holding them accountable. If they don’t, my generation will – mostly inadvertently – continue to borrow excessively from their future.",
            "不要拖累Facebook一代 洛杉矶 — — 年轻人再一次在政治上遭遇了不公平。 英国脱欧公投的结果仅仅是撕裂政治派别、收入水平和种族关系等不断扩大的代际鸿沟的另一种形式的提醒。 18到24岁的英国选民近75%投票留欧，但结果却是上了年纪的选民将“退欧”的结果强加给他们。 这只是别人决定千禧一代及其子孙经济未来的其中一种方式。 我本人是五零后，我感到羞愧和懊恼的是，我担心我们这代人在发达经济体将作为丧失经济主动权的一代被载入史册。 2008年全球金融危机前，我们享受着杠杆盛宴，越来越习惯于借助信用过超出我们能力的生活并承担过多的投机金融风险。 我们停止了对真正增长引擎的投资，任由我们的基础设施破败、教育体制落后、工人培训及重组计划遭到破坏。 我们坐视特殊利益群体绑架预算，从而导致税收体制碎片化并再次阻碍了经济体系的发展。 我们目睹了不平等大幅恶化，这种不平等不仅涉及到财富和收入，而且也涉及到机会。 2008年危机本应在经济上为我们敲响警钟。 但实际却并未起到这样的效果。 我们不仅没有利用这次危机来促进改革，反而放弃责任，仍然沿用以前旧的方法。 具体来讲，我们只是将私营企业信贷置换成了公共部门杠杆。 我们将杠杆过高的银行体系换成了由极度活跃的货币当局推进流动性注入试验。 在此过程中，我们加重了央行的负担，用央行的信誉、政治主权和金融稳定的未来冒险。 后危机时代，我们将银行资产负债表上的私人债务转换成纳税人债务，甚至包括未来的纳税人，却未能强制接受救助的金融体系进行改革。 我们坐视不平等恶化，面对欧洲众多年轻人陷入失业窘境、又从失业过渡到无能力就业的可怕局面无动于衷。 总之，我们为重振包容性可持续发展引擎所做的工作还远远不够，因此削弱了潜在生产能力，并对未来的经济效益造成威胁。 尤其在涉及到环境保护和社会凝聚力的问题上，我们不仅犯下了一系列错误，更大的问题是未能采取行动保障长期可持续发展。 有贫穷的经济自然就会有纷乱的政治，越来越多人已经对政治体制、商业精英和专家意见失去了信任。 由此造成的政治分裂，包括边缘及反体制运动的兴起，进一步加大了制定恰当经济政策的难度。 雪上加霜的是，我们正在对破坏技术创新的监管反弹置之不理，恰恰是这些技术创新动摇了根深蒂固的无效产业，让人们对自己的生活和福祉有更大的自主权。 对Airbnb和Uber等企业的限制在生产和消费领域对年轻人造成了特别沉重的打击。 如果我们不能迅速改变，我们的后代将被迫面对自我强化的经济、金融和政治趋势，他们将被迫背负低增长、高债务、人为抬高资产价格、惊人不平等及党派政治两极分化所带来的负担。 幸运的是，我们意识到了问题的严重性、对这种情况所带来的后果深感忧虑并完全了解解决问题的关键。 鉴于技术创新主要由年轻人主导，就连细微的政策调整也能对经济产生迅速、积极的影响。 通过全面落实相关政策，我们可以把经济停滞、社会固化和市场波动的恶性循环转化为包容性增长、金融稳定和加强政治协调的良性循环。 具体地讲，我们需要同步推进有利于增长的结构性改革、加强需求管理、解决过度负债问题并改善地区和全球政策框架。 虽然上述改革措施十分可取，但只有对政客施加更多建设性压力这样的改革才能兑现。 简单地讲，没有多少政客愿意推动牺牲短期利益来换取长期利益的改革。 那些支持他们的年长选民会对任何侵蚀自身权利的改革方案产生抵触情绪 — — 甚至在自身利益遭到威胁时求助于民粹主义政客和英国退欧等简单而危险的解决方案。 悲哀的是，在涉及政治参与、尤其是直接影响自身及后代福利的问题上年轻人一直过度自满。 没错，支持英国“留欧”运动的年轻选民占到近3/4。 但只有1/3的人真正参与了投票。 毫无疑问，年轻人缺席投票给了年长选民决定权，而即便没有恶意，但年长者的动机和偏好都不同于年轻人。 千禧一代在沟通、旅行、获取和传播信息、集中资源、与企业互动以及众多其他方面赢得了令人印象深刻的话语权。 现在他们必须在选举自身政治代表并要求他们承担责任方面寻求更大的发言权。 如果他们不这样做，我们这代人将在不经意间继续过度透支他们的未来。"

            "How YouTube Brought Politics Back to Russia MOSCOW – Television has occupied a prominent place in Russian households for generations. Relaxing while watching the news after a long day of work is a time-honored routine for many Russians. You might scream back at the people on the screen, but you remain glued to it nonetheless. In the Soviet era, the broadcasters would shamelessly lie across all six channels; today, they lie even more aggressively, and across even more channels. In fact, twenty-first-century Russia has just one independent liberal TV channel: my employer, Dozhd TV, which has been excluded from main cable packages under pressure from the authorities. As a result, many Russians cannot access us, and tend to resort to whatever is available, knowing full well that they can’t believe a word they hear from the “experts” and officials who appear there. They do so out of force of habit, inertia, and laziness – and may continue to do so for a long time. But even under conditions of widespread censorship and ceaseless propaganda, there are promising developments underway in Russian journalism, thanks to the Internet. The country has increasingly come to be divided between two parallel realities: the familiar post-Soviet one, and a new one delivered by YouTube, where one can watch live broadcasts of rallies and protests, deep investigations into official corruption, and interviews with people who have been blacklisted from state television channels. With serious journalism not only surviving but thriving online, Russian authorities are gradually realizing that they must reckon with the real-world consequences of this new virtual world. Consider the case of Sergei Furgal, who unexpectedly won the 2018 gubernatorial election in the Far Eastern city of Khabarovsk even though he had no connection to the ruling party, United Russia. In the ensuing two years, the Kremlin sought to neutralize this political upstart by charging him for several murders committed in 2004-05. Much to the authorities’ surprise, Furgal’s arrest triggered mass demonstrations in Khabarovsk and many other cities. While the protests received only limited coverage on state TV channels, news about them spread like wildfire across social networks and YouTube, where live broadcasts are targeted to a hipper, younger audience. But unlike in the Soviet era, when the hacks on the screen could not hear you, those reporting from rallies read the comments and are responsive to viewer demand. Though the protesters in Khabarovsk were far from other population centers, they knew they were being watched – and supported – by millions of people across Russia. Back before YouTube transformed Russian politics, many journalists here had started to lose all hope of working in the profession. They understood that the choice was either to produce state propaganda or hazard the risks of pursuing genuine, public-interest journalism. If you chose the latter, the authorities would do whatever they could to ruin you financially. But with YouTube, one can make real money doing genuine journalism. Aleksei Pivovarov, a former star of state television, left that world in the mid-2010s and launched Editorial on YouTube in 2018. The channel now features serious coverage of critical national topics, following all the principles of old-fashioned journalism, with high-quality images, on-the-ground reporting, and interviews with parties on all sides of a given issue. With such content absent from Russian television for so long, these online channels have quickly attracted millions of viewers, which translates into millions of rubles from advertising. Moreover, the popularity of independent media on YouTube explodes the myth that Russians do not care about politics. YouTube figures have quickly adapted in order to reach wider audiences. For example, Yuri Dud, a former sports journalist, has cultivated a large, intellectually curious, passionate following. Initially featuring interviews with rappers and talk-show hosts, he has branched out into coverage of politicians and other figures. Dud has had major successes with what once might have seemed like money-losing stories. For example, his videos on HIV in Russia, repression under Stalin, and the 2004 Beslan school terrorist attack have garnered tens of millions of views. Equally important, Dud’s audience is dominated not by the urban liberal intelligentsia but by schoolchildren and students. Dud knows how to engage young people online, and he has been telling Russia’s supposedly apolitical under-30s what is really happening in their country. Finally, among the greatest success stories associated with the new media is Russia’s main opposition leader, Alexei Navalny, whom Russian state TV did not even mention by name until very recently. In August, Navalny was poisoned with the nerve agent Novichok and then airlifted to Berlin for treatment, whereupon Russian state media finally started acknowledging his existence, referring to him as the “Berlin patient,” “hooligan on the Internet,” and just a “blogger.” Navalny, of course, has long been banned from state TV; but that is no longer a problem. He recently granted Dud an interview from Berlin, and that video received more than 15 million views within days of being released. There is no longer any doubt that YouTube has become Russia’s main platform for political journalism. And unlike on state TV, its leading voices cannot get away with shoddy work or mistakes, lest they lose viewers (and thus their chance at fame and fortune). The big question, of course, is how long these online channels can stay open. As matters stand, post-Soviet factotums still underestimate the power of YouTube or are aware of it and know that an outright ban would bring people into the streets on a scale beyond anything seen in Russia’s modern history. Russia is not North Korea. It is home to a generation of brave, free people who increasingly do not bother with state TV. And a growing number of older Russians have begun to follow this generation’s lead. It doesn’t hurt that most TVs now can be connected to the Internet, where a new, fact-based reality awaits viewers.",
            "YouTube如何将政治带回俄罗斯 莫斯科—几代人以来，电视一直在俄罗斯家庭中占据重要的地位。 对许多俄罗斯人来说，在漫长的一天工作结束后，一边看新闻一边放松已是由来已久的习惯。 你可能会对着屏幕上的人大喊，但你仍然会目不转睛地盯着屏幕。 在苏联时期，电视台会在所有六个频道上厚颜无耻地撒谎。 如今，他们的谎言更加猖狂，并且覆盖了更多的频道。 事实上，21世纪的俄罗斯只有一个独立的自由电视频道，那就是我的雇主Dozhd TV。 在当局的压力下，它被排除在主要的有线电视套餐之外。 因此，许多俄罗斯人无法收看我们的节目。 即使清楚自己无法相信主流频道中“专家”和“官员”所言之词，他们却往往出于习惯、保守和思维惰性直接接受这些信息，并且在今后很长时间内都不会有所改变。 然而多亏了互联网，即使在广泛审查和无休止的主旋律宣传下，俄罗斯新闻业的发展仍令人鼓舞。 俄罗斯日益出现两个平行的现实，即我们熟悉的后苏联现实，以及由YouTube提供的新现实。 在YouTube上，人们可以观看集会和抗议的直播、对官员腐败的深入调查，以及被国家电视台列入黑名单的人的采访。 如今，严肃新闻通过网络不仅生存下来，而且正在蓬勃发展。 因此，俄罗斯当局逐渐意识到，他们必须考虑这个新虚拟世界的现实后果。 以谢尔盖·富尔加尔(Sergei Furgal)为例，尽管他与执政的统一俄罗斯党没有任何关系，却出人意料地赢得了2018年远东城市哈巴罗夫斯克的州长选举。 在接下来的两年里，克里姆林宫试图通过指控这位政治暴发户在2004年至2005年期间犯下的几起谋杀案来打压他。 令当局惊讶的是，富尔加尔被捕一事成为了哈巴罗夫斯克和许多其他城市大规模示威的导火索。 虽然国家电视台对抗议活动的报道有限，但关于抗议活动的新闻在社交网络和YouTube上如野火般传播，并面向更时髦、年轻的观众。 与苏联时期线上黑客听不到观众声音的年代相比，那些从集会现场发来报道的人会阅读评论，并对观众的需求做出回应。 尽管哈巴罗夫斯克的抗议者远离其他人口中心，但他们知道他们受到俄罗斯数百万人的关注和支持。 在YouTube改造俄罗斯的政治之前，这里的许多记者已经开始对从事这个职业失去一切希望。 他们明白自己只有两种选择，要么进行国家宣传，要么冒着风险，追求真正符合公共利益新闻。 然而如果选择了后者，当局会想尽一切办法让你破产。 但是在有了YouTube以后，人们能够把坚持真实新闻转换成真金白银。 前国家电视台明星主持阿列克谢·皮沃瓦罗夫(Aleksei Pivovarov)在2010年代中期离开了国家电视台后，于2018年在YouTube上发布了《社论 》 。 该频道在遵循所有旧式新闻的原则上对关键的国家话题进行严肃报道，并且提供高质量的图像、现场报道以及对特定问题各方的采访。 由于俄罗斯电视长期缺乏这类内容，这些在线频道很快吸引了数百万观众，而这也意味着数百万卢布的广告收入。 况且，独立媒体在YouTube上的流行，打破了关于俄罗斯人不关心政治的迷思。 为了接触到更广泛的受众群体，YouTube上的博主也很快地适应了潮流。 例如，前体育记者尤里·达德(Yuri Dud)吸引了一大批求知欲强且充满激情的追随者。 虽然最初的内容多采访说唱歌手和脱口秀主持人，如今采访对象也扩展到了政治家和其他领域的人物。 达德在曾经看似赔钱的故事上取得了巨大的成功。 例如，他关于俄罗斯的艾滋病病毒、斯大林统治下的镇压、以及2004年别斯兰学校恐怖袭击的视频就获得了数千万次浏览量。 同样值得重视的是，达德的主要观众不是城市自由主义知识分子，而是学童和学生。 达德知道如何在网上吸引年轻人的注意力，并且一直在向俄罗斯所谓政治冷感、处于30岁以下年龄段的年轻人展示国家的真实现状。 最后，俄罗斯主要反对党领袖阿列克谢·纳瓦尔尼（Alexei Navalny)是与新媒体相关的最成功故事之一。 直到最近，俄罗斯国家电视台才提到了他的名字。 8月，纳瓦尔尼神经毒剂诺维乔克中毒，被空运到柏林接受治疗。 随后，俄罗斯官方媒体终于开始承认他的存在，称他为“柏林病人 ” 、 “网络流氓 ” ， 说他只是一个“博客作者 ” 。 当然，纳瓦尔尼早就被禁止出现在国家电视台，但这也不再是一个问题。 他最近在柏林接受了杜德的采访，该视频在发布后几天内就获得了超过1500万的浏览量。 毫无疑问，YouTube已经成为报道俄罗斯政治新闻的主要平台。 与国家电视台不同的是，它的领军人物不能妄想在发表粗制滥造或错误的报道后轻易脱身，否则将失去观众，以及成名和发财的机会。 当然，最大的问题是这些在线渠道能够开放多久。 就目前情况而言，后苏联时期的事务总管仍然低估了YouTube的力量。 又或者，他们已经认识到了这一点，却也知道全面取缔Youtube将使人们走上街头，抗议规模也将在俄罗斯现代历史上绝无仅有。 俄罗斯并不是朝鲜。 这里孕育着一代勇敢、并且追求自由的人，而他们逐渐地不再理会国家电视台。 越来越多老一辈的俄罗斯人也开始跟随这一代人的步伐。 值得欣慰的是，现在大多数电视都可以连接互联网。 在这里，一个新的、基于事实的现实正等待着观众。"

            "A Prisoner’s Reflections on Nelson Mandela KHARKIV – Incarceration is said to leave you with a feeling of helplessness and vulnerability. But the truth of life for a political prisoner, even for one on a hunger strike, is the opposite. As a prisoner, I have been forced to focus on what is essential about myself, my political beliefs, and my country. So I can almost feel the presence of the brave women and men, old and young, who have gathered in Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities to defend their dreams of a democratic and European future. In prison, your hopes and dreams become your reality. I am sure that Nelson Mandela would have understood my feelings and agreed. The South African apartheid regime may have locked him away for almost three decades, but in the great Soweto protests and the other demonstrations for freedom and equality, courageous young South Africans invariably looked to his example and felt his presence. Around the world, most people now rightly celebrate the gentle dignity with which Mandela led South Africa out of the political wilderness. Even here, behind prison bars and 24-hour surveillance of the type that he experienced for so long, I can conjure the warmth of his broad smile, merry eyes, and those colorful Hawaiian-style shirts that he wore with such panache. And I can admire his unyielding – and, yes, sometimes wily – commitment to reconciliation, which saved his country from the race war that those who refused to accept the end of white-minority rule saw as inevitable. How wrong they were, and how miraculous was Mandela’s achievement in making even his most implacable enemies feel at home in post-apartheid South Africa. But here, in this place, it is not Mandela the statesman who touches my soul and fires my imagination. “My” Mandela is the prisoner, the Mandela of Robben Island, who endured 27 years behind bars (18 of them on a rock in the South Atlantic) and yet emerged with his spirit intact, brimming with a vision of a tolerant South Africa, a country liberated even for apartheid’s architects and beneficiaries. No purges marked the end of white rule. There were no witch-hunts, nor was there summary justice. All that Mandela demanded was that the truth about the past be revealed. Through the unique innovation of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, Mandela found the only viable bridge between his country’s racist legacy and its multi-racial present and future – a combination of political genius and humane wisdom that only the greatest of leaders possess. Mandela was able to guide South Africa to freedom, because he was able to see its future more clearly than those who lived through the apartheid years outside of prison. Indeed, he possessed that rare clarity of moral vision that prison – perhaps like no other environment – can nurture. Imprisonment brought Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn this clarity as well. “Gradually it was disclosed to me that the line separating good and evil passes not through states, nor between classes, nor between political parties, either – but right through every human heart – and through all human hearts,” he wrote in The Gulag Archipelago. “This line shifts….And even within hearts overwhelmed by evil, one small bridgehead of good is retained. And even in the best of all hearts, there remains...an un-uprooted small corner of evil.” The ability to begin to see more clearly than most the inner workings of the human soul is one of the few gifts that imprisonment can bestow. Forced to reckon with your own vulnerability, isolation, and losses (and seemingly lost cause), you learn to look more carefully into the human heart – yours and that of your jailers. Mandela epitomized this rare gift. How else could he have personally invited one of his Robben Island jailers to attend his inauguration as South Africa’s first democratically elected president? Of course, behind Mandela’s generous spirit was a character of steel. He bore his imprisonment for the sake of his cause. And he bore the anguish of the suffering imposed on his family. And yet he neither broke nor surrendered to the rage that would have consumed most people. As usual, Mandela’s own words about his day of personal liberation show how well he understood this: “As I walked out the door toward the gate that would lead to my freedom, I knew if I didn’t leave my bitterness and hatred behind, I’d still be in prison.” And just as Mandela knew in his prison cell that apartheid would one day fall, I know in my solitude that Ukraine’s ultimate triumph as a European democracy is certain.",
            "纳尔逊·曼德拉牢狱生活反思 哈尔科夫 — — 监禁据说能令人体会到无助和脆弱。 但政治犯、即使是绝食政治犯的真实生活也恰恰反其道而行之。 身为囚犯的我曾被迫反省我的政治信仰、国家，以及什么对我必不可少。 因此我几乎可以感觉到聚集在基辅和其他乌克兰城市捍卫民主和欧洲未来之梦的勇敢的男男女女、老老少少。 在狱中，希望和梦想与现实是完全重合的。 我相信纳尔逊·曼德拉理解并赞同我的感受。 南非种族隔离政权可能已经囚禁了他近30年，但在大规模索韦托抗议和其他争取自由和平等的示威行动里，勇敢的南非年轻人不约而同地学习他的榜样、感受他的存在。 世界各地多数民众现在理所当然地赞美曼德拉领导南非走出政治旷野的温和与尊严。 即使在监狱铁窗和他长期经历的24小时监控背后，我一样能想象出他灿烂温和的笑容、快乐的眼神和身上五颜六色的夏威夷衬衫。 但我最欣赏他不屈不挠，有时甚至透露出些许狡黠的和解原则，正是这些原则让南非避免陷入种族内战，而在拒绝接受白人少数统治末日的人看来内战是必然的结果。 他们实在错得离谱，因为曼德拉奇迹般地让最不共戴天的敌人也在后种族隔离时代的南非找到了家一般的感觉。 但此时此刻，触动我的灵魂、激发我的想象力的却不是政治家曼德拉。 “我的”曼德拉是罗本岛上忍受了27年铁窗生涯但仍然不改初衷的囚犯（其中18年他被关押在南大西洋岛礁 ） 。 曼德拉眼前充斥着宽容南非的愿景，即使是种族隔离的设计和受益者同样能够享受这里的自由。 白人统治结束没有带来种族清洗。 没有政治迫害，也没有简单执法。 曼德拉只要求公布过去的真相。 通过真相与和解委员会的独特创造，曼德拉找到了南非种族主义传统和多种族现在与未来间唯一的桥梁 — — 他的所作所为融会了最伟大领袖才具备的人文智慧和政治天才。 曼德拉能引导南非走向自由，因为他比狱外渡过种族隔离年代的人更能清楚预见到南非的未来。 在他身上，监狱比其他任何环境更能勾画出清晰的道德目标。 亚历山大·索尔仁尼琴眼中的清晰愿景同样源自于监禁生活。 他在《古拉格群岛》中写道 ， “ 我逐渐意识到善恶的分界线不在于国家、不在于阶级、也不在于政党，而在于我们每个人的内心之中。 这条线不断变化…即使已不堪邪恶重负的心灵也保留着小小的善的桥头堡。 而即使是在���善良的内心，仍留有未曾连根拔起的小小的恶的角落 。 ” 监狱生活恰恰可以带来超乎多数人类灵魂的认识清晰度。 被迫对自身的弱点、孤立、损失（以及看似迷失的事业）进行思考，你学会了如何审视人类（你和你的看守）内心的欲望。 曼德拉身上汇聚了这种难得的天赋。 否则他怎么会亲自邀请他在罗本岛上的监狱看守出席他担任南非首任民选总统的就职典礼？ 当然，在曼德拉慷慨精神的背后是他刚强的性格。 他为了自己的事业忍受着监禁生活。 他独自承受着亲人遭受折磨的痛苦。 但他在足以吞噬大部分人的愤怒面前既没有崩溃，也没有投降。 像以往一样，曼德拉对个人解放日的话语显示出他深刻的理解 ： “ 当我走向通往自由的大门时，我知道如果我不放下过去的仇恨和痛苦，我就仍然是一名囚徒 。 ” 正如监狱里的曼德拉知道种族隔离终有一天会土崩瓦解，我在孤独的牢狱生涯中也知道乌克兰最终必将成为成功的欧洲民主国家。"

            "Sweet Caroline in Tokyo TOKYO – Fifty years have passed since the assassination of US President John F. Kennedy, with official ceremonies held in Washington, DC, and Dallas to commemorate the anniversary. But JFK’s eldest daughter, Caroline Kennedy, was not present at either event; she had just taken up her post in Tokyo as the 29th US Ambassador to Japan. On November 19, thousands of people lined the streets to catch a glimpse of Kennedy as she made her way from Tokyo Station to the Imperial Palace, around a kilometer away, by horse-drawn carriage to present her credentials to the emperor. Waving to the onlookers, she looked like Snow White. November 22, 1963, was also the day satellite broadcasting from the United States to Japan began, and many Japanese got up early to watch a speech by JFK in Dallas that began at 5:30 a.m. But, rather than airing the speech, the broadcast brought the shocking news of the assassination. The image of young Caroline – the inspiration for Neil Diamond’s famous song – solemnly standing beside her three-year-old brother as he saluted his father’s coffin is deeply engrained in the hearts of Japan’s people. So there probably is not a single Japanese who would not welcome her as US Ambassador. US ambassadors to Japan have come in three types. There have been academic experts on Japan, like the acclaimed scholar Edwin Reischauer. There have also been political heavyweights, such as Michael Mansfield, a long-time Democratic majority leader of the US Senate, former Vice President Walter Mondale, former Speaker of the House of Representatives Thomas Foley, and Senator Howard Baker, who also served as President Ronald Reagan’s chief of staff. The third type are presidential political appointees, such as Thomas Schieffer, a former business partner of President George W. Bush, and John Roos, a noted Silicon Valley lawyer. Clearly, Caroline Kennedy, an important early supporter of President Barack Obama, is in this category. Indeed, her backing for Obama in the Democratic Party primaries in 2008, when he was still a relatively unknown senator from Illinois, gave his campaign credibility among party insiders who remain loyal to her family’s legacy. Kennedy’s address to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee during her confirmation hearing elicited bipartisan support – a rare occurrence nowadays, given America’s highly polarized national politics – and she received unanimous approval. Although she lacks formal political or diplomatic experience, her personal connections, particularly to Obama, will have great significance for US-Japan relations. And there are pressing issues that need the new ambassador’s attention. For example, there are security questions related to strengthening the alliance between Japan and the US, including the relocation of the Futenma Air Station, the base of operations for the US Marine Corps on Okinawa. There are also issues related to economic cooperation, such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), the proposed mega-regional free-trade treaty covering Pacific Rim economies. Although powerful domestic interest groups, particularly those representing the agricultural sector, have objected to Japanese participation in the TPP negotiations, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s government chose to join the talks late in the day. Instead of banking the political capital that his high approval ratings had given him, he chose to spend some of it on an initiative that his predecessors had rejected, but that will help to transform myriad aspects of Japan’s economy. Of course, given today’s hyper-partisan environment in the US, there is a danger that fast-track negotiating authority – under which Congress binds itself to an up-or-down vote on trade agreements (thereby precluding amendments and filibusters) – will not be given to the president. If this roadblock cannot be overcome and the agreement stalls, the Abe government’s approval ratings will suffer, despite progress in the negotiations. Given the unanimity with which Kennedy was confirmed, she may be able to use her own political capital to help sell fast-track authority in Congress. The Abe government is banking on its high approval rating not only to participate in the TPP, but also to address the need to escape from 15 years of deflation and strengthen Japan’s national-security posture, which has been hamstrung for decades. Given the nexus of issues that tie vital US interests to Japan’s reform process, Kennedy, with her character and skills, could well prove to be an essential link between the countries at a crucial point in their relationship.",
            "亲爱的卡洛琳来到东京 东京—美国总统约翰·肯尼迪遇刺已经过去了五十年，华盛顿和达拉斯都举行了正式的仪式纪念这一时刻。 但肯尼迪的长女卡洛琳·肯尼迪没有现身于这两个场合；她刚刚履新第29任美国驻日本大使。 11月19日，肯尼迪乘坐马车从东京站前往一千米外的日本皇宫，向天皇递交自己的任命状，数千人聚集在街道两侧，争相一睹肯尼迪的风采。 肯尼迪朝群众挥手致意，看起来就像是白雪公主。 1963年11月22日是美国-日本卫星广播开通的日子，许多日本人早早起床，只为收看清晨5:30开始的肯尼迪达拉斯演讲。 但是，广播并没有送出肯尼迪的声音，而是传来了肯尼迪遇刺的惊天噩耗。 年轻的卡洛琳肃穆地站在朝父亲棺椁敬礼三岁的弟弟身边 — — 受尼尔·戴蒙德（Neil Diamond）名曲的启发 — — 这一形象深深地刻在日本人民心头。 因此，恐怕没有一位日本人会不欢迎她成为美国大使。 美国驻日本大使有三种类型。 一种是日本学专家，如广受欢迎的赖肖尔（Edwin Reischauer ） 。 一种是重磅政治人物，如长期担任美国参议院民主党多数领袖的曼斯菲尔德（Michael Mansfield ） 、 前副总统蒙代尔（Walter Mondale ） 、 前众议院发言人弗雷（Thomas Foley）和参议员、罗纳德·里根总统幕僚长贝克尔（Howard Baker ） 。 第三类来自总统的政治任命，如谢佛（Thomas Schieffer）是小布什的前商业伙伴；罗斯（John Roos）是前硅谷律师。 显然，作为奥巴马重要的早期支持者，卡洛琳·肯尼迪也属于这一类。 事实上，她在2008年民主党预选时就支持奥巴马，当时他还只是个相对无名的伊利诺伊州参议员。 卡洛琳使奥巴马的竞选赢得了仍忠于肯尼迪家族的民主党内人物中间的信誉。 在参议院对外关系委员会的任命确认听证会演讲中，肯尼迪获得了来自两党的支持 — — 者在当下美国高度两极分化的国内政坛中时不多见的 — — 赢得了一致通过。 尽管她缺少正式的政治和外交经验，但她的个人关系，特别是与奥巴马的关系，将极大地影响美日关系。 这位新大使需要关注一些紧迫问题。 比如与强化美日安全同盟有关的问题，包括处置普天间空军基地和美国冲绳海军基地。 还有与经济合作有关的问题，比如谈判中的覆盖环太平洋经济体的巨型地区自由贸易协定 — — 跨太平洋合作伙伴关系（TPP ） 。 尽管强大的国内利益集团，特别是代表农业部门的利益集团反对日本加入TPP谈判，但安倍晋三政府最后还是选择加入谈判。 安倍晋三没有选择巩固高支��率给他带来的政治资本，而是选择拿出一些政治资本用于追求被他的前任所拒绝，但有助于日本经济各个方面转型的计划。 当然，考虑当当今美国高度党派化的政治环境，美国总统未必能够获得“快车道”谈判权 — — 国会对贸易协定仍坚持要么否决要么通过的态度（从而排除了修正和拖延的空间 ） 。 如果这一障碍无法克服，TPP谈判陷入僵局，那么安倍政府的支持率将受到影响，即便谈判取得进展。 肯尼迪的任命获得了一致肯定，因此她有望利用其自身政治资本帮助国会授予奥巴马快车道谈判权。 安倍政府不但依赖其高支持率参与TPP，还依赖高支持率解决走出15年通缩、强化日本国家安全姿态（几十年来一直处于瘫痪状态）的需要。 这些问题将美国的关键利益与日本的改革过程捆绑在了一起，而肯尼迪的人格和技能能够让她成为两国关系关键点上的关键连接。"

            "Who Lost Thailand? TOKYO – Thailand, Southeast Asia’s most developed and sophisticated economy, is teetering on the edge of the political abyss. Yet most of the rest of Asia appears to be averting its eyes from the country’s ongoing and increasingly anarchic unrest. That indifference is not only foolish; it is dangerous. Asia’s democracies now risk confronting the same harsh question that the United States faced when Mao Zedong marched into Beijing, and again when Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini ousted the Shah in Iran. Who, they will have to ask, lost Thailand? Much of the world is wondering how such a successful economy could allow its politics to spin out of control. What accounts for the armies of protesters – distinguished, gang-like, by the color of their shirts – whose mutual antipathy often borders on nihilistic rage? The roots of the current unrest extend back more than a decade, to former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra’s first electoral victory in 2001. Thaksin’s triumph did not represent the normal alternation in power that one finds in a democracy. Instead, his victory heralded the political rise of the country’s poor, long-silenced rural majority. Bangkok’s entrenched elite recoiled in alarm. But, instead of learning to compete with Thaksin for the votes of Thailand’s rural poor, the country’s urban elite (including the powerful military) sought to delegitimize his rule. When he was re-elected by an even larger majority, his government was overthrown, his political party was banned by the Supreme Court, and he was forced to flee the country after corruption charges against him led to a criminal conviction. Yet Thaksin’s supporters did not abandon him. When Thailand’s military returned to their barracks, many Thai citizens voted for Thaksin at one remove, with his sister – Yingluck Shinawatra, a long-time executive at Thaksin’s communications firm – becoming Prime Minister, supported by a powerful parliamentary majority. For much of her term in office, Yingluck garnered praise for her pragmatism, and for seeking to ameliorate the antagonism of her opponents. But that praise and success appears to have bred a form of hubris. She proposed an amnesty law that would have not only pardoned opposition leaders, including Abhisit Vejjajiva, her predecessor as prime minister (who faces murder charges), but allowed her brother to return to the country. And, in defiance of a Supreme Court ruling, she sought a constitutional amendment that would make the Senate, whose members are appointed, an elected body. The opposition, sensing that its moment had arrived, launched a wave of street protests. Yingluck, in an effort to defuse the situation, called for a parliamentary election in February. But the opposition has rejected this and says that it will boycott the vote. It fears – rightly, most people suspect – that the Thaksin camp will be returned to power in any free and fair vote. So, in essence, what is happening in Thailand is an attempted nullification of democracy by the opposition and the country’s entrenched elite. Unable to compete successfully with Thaksin for votes, they now want to dilute Thai democracy in order to prevent the electorate from ever again choosing a government that goes against their will. If Thailand were an insignificant country with little geostrategic weight, its problems might not matter as much as they do to the rest of Asia. But Thailand is Southeast Asia’s lynchpin economy. It is a key partner for Myanmar (Burma) as it makes its own political and economic transition, and it is a hub for trade with neighboring Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam. But the biggest reason that Thailand matters for Asia’s democracies is fierce competition for influence between a rising China and the democratic world. Until now, Thailand has been a firm member of the democratic camp. Its military is mostly trained by the United States; indeed, it was the key staging point for the US during the Vietnam War. Likewise, Japan and India have long regarded Thailand as a democratic bulwark in a neighborhood where some regimes – Cambodia and Laos – are firmly under China’s hegemonic sway. Indeed, its government has proved to be a strong supporter of Myanmar’s president, Thein Sein, as he seeks to free his country from China’s tight embrace. By standing aside as Thailand’s opposition and traditional elite seek to undermine the country’s democracy in the name of a permanent right to rule, Asia’s democracies risk driving some elements of the Thaksin camp into the arms of China, which would happily accept the role of patron to so potent a political force. But this need not happen. Thailand’s military has long and respectful ties not only with the US military, but with officers in Japan as well. Thailand’s opposition politicians, many of whom were educated at top Western universities, may also be open to quiet advice that they are pushing things too far, not only putting Thailand’s stability at risk, but also jeopardizing regional security. Just as, a decade ago, the West objected to the efforts of Turkey’s entrenched secular elite to rob Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s mildly Islamist AKP party of its democratic victory, it needs to speak clearly today in defense of Thai democracy. The opposition’s claim that it is acting in the interests of the world’s democracies needs to be rebutted. Thaksin may be no saint, and some constitutional reform will be needed if political reconciliation is to come about. But Thaksin’s governments, like that of his sister, have kept China at one remove from influence. That is the key strategic interest that is now at stake. Should Yingluck be ousted in a coup, or should the country’s democracy be hollowed out to preclude her return to power, the Shinawatras may be left with no choice but to seek support from Thailand’s giant neighbor to the north. If that happens, we will all know who lost Thailand. We did.",
            "谁输掉了泰国？ 东京—泰国，东南亚最发达、最成熟的经济体，正在政治悬崖边沿徘徊。 但亚洲大部分国家并没有把目光放在泰国日益高涨的无政府主义骚乱上。 如此冷漠不但愚蠢，更十分危险。 亚洲民主国家现在面临着美国在毛泽东入主北京和霍梅尼推翻伊朗国王时相同的紧迫问题。 他们必须问一问，谁输掉了泰国？ 世界上很多国家奇怪于为何如此成功的经济体会让政治失控。 是什么让衣服颜色显著易辨、如黑帮般的游行大军上了街？ 而他们所表达的共同愤怒又往往是虚无的？ 当前乱象的根源可以追溯到十多年前。 2001年，前首相他信第一次在选举中获胜。 他信的胜利并没有带来民主国家常见的权力更迭。 相反，他的胜利标志着泰国长期处于分割状态的贫穷农村大众的政治崛起。 曼谷的老牌精英成了杯弓蛇影。 但是，泰国城市精英（包括强大的军方）并没有通过选票和泰国困苦农民竞争，而是选择推翻他信的合法执政地位。 在他信以更大的优势获得连任后，他的政府遭到了颠覆，他的政党被最高法院取缔，他也被迫在因为腐败指控被判有罪后逃亡。 但他信的支持者并没有抛弃他。 当泰国军方回归军营后，许多泰国公民坚定地支持他信，因此其妹、长期担任他信的通信公司首席执行官的英拉在议会压倒多数的支持下成为总理。 在执政的大部分时间里，英拉凭借其实用主义作风以及试图缓解反对派反应而赢得赞誉。 但她获得的赞誉和成功也催生了自大。 她所提出的的大赦法不但将原宥她的前任、面临谋杀指控的阿披实（Abhisit Vejjajiva）等反对派领袖，也将允许她的兄长他信回国。 此外，她无视最高法院的裁决，寻求通过修宪让参议院议员由制定变为选举产生。 反对派认为时机已到，发动了一系列街头游行。 为了平息事态，英拉宣布在2月举行议会选举。 但反对派拒绝了这一方案，表示将抵制选举。 反对派担心 — — 大部分人认为确实需要担心 — — 自由公平的选举会让他信阵营重新掌权。 因此，从本质上说，泰国发生的其实是反对派和老牌精英试图推翻民主。 他们无力在选举中与他信一决雌雄，因此希望推翻泰国的民主制度，以防止当选者选择与他们的意愿作对的政府。 如果泰国是一个在地缘战略上无关紧要的小国，那���它的问题对亚洲其他国家或许并没有什么大不了的。 但泰国是东南亚至关重要的经济体。 它是缅甸在其自身政治和经济过渡阶段的重要伙伴，也是邻国柬埔寨、老挝和越南的贸易枢纽。 但泰国对亚洲民主国家之所以重要，最大的原因是崛起的中国和民主世界之间正在进行激烈的竞争。 到目前为止，泰国一直坚定地站在民主阵营。 泰国军队大多由美国训练；事实上，泰国也是越南战争期间美国在的重要驻军地点。 类似地，日本和印度也一直视为周边国家中的民主堡垒，在它们的邻国中，柬埔寨和老挝等国家一直被中国的霸权主义牢牢地控制着。 泰国政府是缅甸总统吴登盛的强大支持者，而吴登盛正在寻求让缅甸摆脱中国的牢牢控制。 泰国反对派和传统精英正在打着永久执政权利的名号破坏泰国的民主，如果亚洲民主国家袖手旁观，将有可能让他信阵营中的一些部分倒向中国的怀抱，而中国也将乐于接受为强如他信阵营的政治势力提供保护。 但这并非不可避免。 长期以来，泰国军方不但与美国军方有着良好关系，与日本军官关系也不错。 不少泰国反对派政客在顶尖西方大学受过教育，他们能够接受安静的建议 — — 行动有些过火，不但威胁了泰国的稳定，也影响了地区安全。 正如十年前西方拒绝土耳其老牌精英推翻埃尔多安温和派AKP党的民主胜利的图谋，如今西方也需要旗帜鲜明地捍卫泰国民主。 必须剥去反对派所宣称的他们是在为全世界民主需要而奋斗的说法的画皮。 他信不是圣人，要形成政治妥协也需要做出一些宪政改革。 但他信政府和英拉政府都一致地抵制着中国的影响力。 这才是如今最重要的战略利益。 如果英拉被政变推翻，或泰国民主因为阻止她重新掌权而被架空，那么他信和英拉所属的西那瓦（Shinawatra）家族将别无选择，只能向中国寻求支持。 果真如此的话，我们所有人都将知道谁输掉了泰国。 我们。"

            "Equality or Estrangement TOKYO – Those whom the gods would destroy, they grant their wishes. Will that bit of ancient wisdom now hold for the United States and Japan? For a half-century, the US, which wrote Japan’s postwar “peace” constitution, has pressed the Japanese to play a greater role in maintaining Asian and global stability. But now that Japan finally has a leader who agrees, the US is getting nervous, with Secretary of State John Kerry supposedly calling Japan under Prime Minister Shinzo Abe “unpredictable.” These strains in the US-Japan relationship – surely the foundation stone of Asian stability – first became noticeable in December, when Abe visited the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo, which houses the “souls” of (among others) Class A war criminals from the Pacific War. The US has always criticized Japanese officials’ visits to the shrine, but through diplomatic channels. This time, America voiced its displeasure openly. The US is rightly concerned about the negative impact of such pilgrimages on Japan’s relations with its neighbors, particularly China and South Korea. But the harsh tone publicly adopted by President Barack Obama’s administration raised serious concerns among some in Abe’s government who question Obama’s commitment to the alliance and suspect that he was using the Yasukuni issue as a pretext to signal a weakening of America’s defense commitment. Such suspicions were sharpened after China declared its new Air Defense Identification Zone, which overlaps Japanese sovereign territory. The US tried to have it both ways: though the Obama administration sent US bombers through the new ADIZ to demonstrate its refusal to recognize China’s move, it also told US commercial airliners to acknowledge the zone and report their flight plans to the Chinese authorities. Likewise, US acquiescence in China’s de facto ouster of the Philippines from the Scarborough Shoal (a disputed outcropping in the South China Sea) raised questions in Japan about the two countries’ supposed harmony of interests. In fact, although the US extols the virtues of its partnership with Japan, successive American presidents have been vague about the details. Ultimately, the idea always seemed to be that Japan would pay more for defense, but the US would set the partnership’s objectives. Abe’s conception of the US-Japan partnership presupposes much greater equality. After all, a society like Japan, trying to escape two decades of economic malaise, cannot feel completely comfortable outsourcing its national-security strategy, even to an ally that is as respected and reliable as the US. Far from being based on chest-thumping nationalism, Abe’s national-security strategy reflects, above all, a deep awareness of how a lost generation of economic growth has affected the Japanese. His bravura diplomatic performances sometimes give the impression that a self-confident Japan has been a normal feature of the global landscape. Strangely, it is all but forgotten – particularly by the Chinese – that for two decades Japan has watched China’s rise quietly from the sidelines (even supportively, to the extent that Japanese investors have poured in billions of dollars in the three decades since Deng Xiaoping opened the economy). Indeed, Abe has succeeded so well in returning Japan to the world stage that his US and Asian critics act as if the only problem now is to moderate Japanese self-confidence – a notion that would have been laughable just two years ago. But the fact remains that one of Abe’s primary worries is the spiritual malaise that accompanied Japan’s long economic stagnation. Those who see in his patriotic rhetoric a desire to whitewash history miss his real concern: economic revival is meaningless if it does not secure Japan’s position as a leading Asian power. The US, however, regards Abe’s worries about Japan’s spirit as peripheral to its efforts to forge a lasting relationship with China and overhaul its strategic presence in the Pacific. For example, the US views the Trans-Pacific Partnership – the huge trade agreement involving it, Japan, and 10 other leading Pacific Rim countries – as a technical scheme that will bring economic benefits through greater trade. But, for Abe, the TPP’s value for Japan’s sense of identity – that it is now a more outward-looking nation – is just as important. In Abe’s view, Japan needs to regain, wherever possible, the right of independent decision-making if it is to manage successfully the challenge posed to it by China. This does not mean that Abe’s Japan will become an ally like France under Jacques Chirac, spurning US leadership for the sake of it; instead, Abe seeks a policy of cooperation with the US that reflects the alliance's voluntary nature. He believes that, given the new balance of power in Asia, the alliance will be meaningful only if each partner has a real choice, and the wherewithal, to act autonomously or with regional allies. Fortunately, Japanese and American analyses of Chinese trends are not very different. Both generally view China as having embarked on a probing strategy in search of weak spots where it can expand its geopolitical reach. And both believe that only when China is convinced that such probes will yield no lasting benefit can serious negotiations about a comprehensive security structure for Asia take place. But even here, there is a difference. The US, convinced of the importance of intentions in the conduct of foreign policy, believes that once China recognizes the limits to its power, a structure of peace will follow naturally. Abe, by contrast, believes that only a favorable balance of power can be relied upon, and he is determined that Japan play its part in constructing that balance. Although Abe has lifted Japan’s sights and self-confidence, he recognizes that Japan faces real limits. The US, too, should recognize that there are limits to the extent of the subordination that it can ask of an ally. Some wishes really are better left unfulfilled.",
            "平等还是隔阂 东京—神要毁灭一个人，就会给他希望。 这一古老智慧对现在的美国和日本成立吗？ 半个世纪以来，替日本制定了战后“和平”宪法的美国一直要求日本在维持亚洲和全球稳定方面扮演更重要的角色。 但如今日本终于有了一位愿意这样做的领导人，而美国却开始紧张了，据说其国务卿约翰·克里称首相安倍晋三治下的日本“难以预测 ” 。 美日关系 — — 毫无疑问，这一关系是亚洲稳定的基石 — — 的这些掣肘首次进入公众视线是去年12月，当时安倍晋三访问了供奉太平洋战争甲级战犯（及其他 ） “ 灵位”的东京靖国神社。 美国一直对日本官员拜访靖国神社持批评态度，但都是通过外交渠道表达的。 而这一回美国公开表示了不满之情。 美国担心惨败靖国神社会妨碍日本与邻国（特别是中国和韩国）的关系，这是正确的。 但美国总统奥巴马政府公开的强硬语调让安倍政府中的不少人产生了审慎的忧虑，质疑奥巴马关于美日同盟的承诺，并怀疑他准备把靖国神社问题作为弱化美国防务承诺的借口。 中国宣布其新的防空识别区的举动加深了这一质疑。 中国的防空识别区与部分日本领土重叠。 美国试图持两端：尽管奥巴马政府派遣美国轰炸机进入防空识别区以表明拒绝接受中国的举动，但它同时又通知美国商业航空公司承认防空识别区，向中国当局报告飞行计划。 类似地，美国对中国将菲律宾人驱逐出黄岩岛（位于南海的争议岛礁）的事实举动采取了默许态度。 ，这让日本怀疑这两个国家有利益协调。 事实上，尽管美国大肆赞颂与日本的合作伙伴关系，但历届美国总统从来不对此做详细阐述。 说到底，这一思想永远是日本为防务出钱，而美国则为其合作伙伴制定目标。 安倍晋三的美日合作伙伴关系概念以更大的平等为前提。 毕竟，对于日本这样的正在试图摆脱二十年经济低迷的社会，不可能心安理得地将其国家安全战略外包给他国，哪怕这个“他国”是最令人尊敬、最可靠的美国。 安倍晋三的国家安全战略决非民族主义空头许诺，而是首先植根于深刻地理解失去的二十年对日本人的影响。 他的大胆的外交举措有时会给人造成一种印象，认为自信的日本已经成为全球图景中的常规元素。 奇怪的是，人们 — — 特别是中国人 — — 似乎都忘了二十年来日本一直静静地旁观着中国的崛起（甚至起着支持作用，自邓小平采取改革开放政策以来，三十年里日本投资者向中国投资了数十亿美元 ） 。 事实上，安倍晋三在让日本回归世界舞台方面做得十分成功，就连他的美国和亚洲批评者似乎也认为现在唯一的问题是如何抑制日本的自信心 — — 换做两年前，这样的观点还显得颇为可笑。 但事实依然是安倍晋三首先要担心伴随日本长期经济停滞而生的精神不振。 认为安倍晋三的爱国言论是为了洗白历史是错判了他的关注点：如果不能保证日本作为亚洲���先国家的地位，那么经济即使复苏了也没有意义。 但是，美国将安倍晋三对日本精神的担忧视为次要因素，而把构建它和中国的持续关系以及改观其在太平洋的战略面貌作为首要目标。 比如，美国把跨太平洋合作伙伴关系（Trans-Pacific Partnership，TPP，包括美国、日本和其他十个环太平洋国家在内的大型贸易协定）视为一项通过贸易给经济带来好处的技术安排。 但是，对安倍晋三来说，TPP对日本作为一个更加外向的国家的身份感的价值也同样重要。 在安倍晋三看来，日本需要尽一切可能重新实现独立决策，这样才能成功地应对中国带来的挑战。 这并不意味着安倍晋三的日本会变成像希拉克治下的法国那样的盟友并敦促美国为了它而担起领导之责；相反，安倍晋三寻求反映自愿原则的与美国合作的政策。 他认为，在亚洲新实力平衡的环境下，美国和日本都必须拥有自主或与地区盟友联合行动的真正的选择权和手段，惟其如此，联盟才会有意义。 幸运的是，日本和美国对中国趋势的分析并无多少不同。 总体而言，两国都认为中国采取的是试探战略，寻找其可以扩张地缘政治影响的薄弱点。 两国也都认为，只有中国相信这样的试探战略起不了持续性的效果，亚洲才有可能展开全面安全结构的严肃谈判。 但即使在这方面也仍然存在一个不同点。 美国认为在外交政策中，意图是一个很重要的因素，它相信，只要中国认识到其实力的极限在哪里，就会自然而然地产生和平结构。 相反，安倍晋三相信，只有有利的实力平衡才是可靠的，他决心要让日本在构建这一平衡上起作用。 尽管安倍晋三提升了日本的视界和自信，但他也承认日本面临现实的局限。 美国也明白，其盟友对其的屈从是有限度的。 一些愿望还是不要实现的好。"

            "Securing Japan TOKYO – Shinzo Abe’s second term as Japan’s prime minister began with a laser-like focus on economic revitalization. That policy, almost instantly dubbed “Abenomics,” comprises what have been called the three “arrows”: bold monetary policy, an expansionary fiscal stance, and structural reforms to stimulate private investment. Hosting the Olympic Games in Tokyo in 2020 has added a fourth arrow to this quiver in the form of increased infrastructure investment and tourism revenue in the years leading up to the Games. To be sure, after 15 years of deflationary recession, revitalization of the Japanese economy remains far from complete. Nonetheless, the effects of Abe’s reforms are becoming visible in areas such as equity prices and exchange rates. But Abe also confronts a security environment in Asia that is every bit as brittle as Japan’s economy was before his government took office last December. Indeed, he confronted many of the same issues during his first administration seven years ago. His efforts back then were halted by his own resignation, and he is now making a second attempt to establish a national-security governance system to meet Japan’s needs – and those of its allies – in twenty-first-century Asia. In a speech to a plenary session of the lower house of Japan’s Diet on October 25, Abe emphasized that, given the current security situation in Asia, “It is essential to strengthen command functions for implementing the prime minister’s national security policy.” Now that split control of the Diet’s upper and lower houses has been resolved, with Abe’s Liberal Democrats in strong control of both chambers, a bill to modernize Japan’s national-security governance is certain to pass. The bill that Abe has submitted aims to establish a Japanese National Security Council, based on lessons from the successes and failures of similar institutions in other countries, such as the NSC in the United States. The Security Council of Japan – something of a stopgap measure created to provide advice from relevant cabinet members to the prime minister in times of crisis – will now be reorganized as a formal institution. The new NSC’s membership will be limited to the prime minister, the cabinet secretary, and the foreign and defense ministers, with relevant ministers added on an ad hoc basis. A permanent National Security Secretariat, headed by a person with abundant diplomatic experience, will be established in the prime minister’s office, with 60 security specialists from various fields laying the policy groundwork for medium- and long-term national security strategy. This strategy will then be reflected in guidelines issued to Japan’s defense bodies and diplomats. Japan, like other countries, has faced jurisdictional disputes among foreign-policy, defense, and police agencies that have hindered the aggregation and analysis of intelligence information. But, with the creation of the NSC, each ministry and agency will report important national-security information to the new secretariat, which will then carry out integrated analysis and issue reports to the prime minister and others. Of course, as in other countries, bureaucracies are creatures of habit. As we can already see, it will not be easy to overcome the obstacles posed by vertically integrated ministries and agencies. Institutionalization will take time – and the importance of its success cannot be understated. For example, the new NSC will be responsible for sharing intelligence with other countries, including the US, Japan’s most important ally. As a result, ensuring the protection of information will be a key issue, particularly given the old habit of leaking security information to the press. That is why the Diet is also considering a bill on the protection of classified information that would impose harsher punishment on government officials who leak secrets, particularly those concerning national security. The trauma of gag laws that were imposed on the press before and during World War II resulted in the elimination of all restraints afterwards, which had the effect of making Japan a spy’s paradise, with insufficient counterintelligence measures and poor secrecy. Moreover, the long decades of peace since 1945 have served to lower awareness among politicians of the need for confidentiality. For example, Japanese newspapers always report when, where, and with whom the Prime Minister met for dinner in the following day’s editions. In contrast to the US system of presidential government, Japan has a parliamentary form of government. Yet the goals of national security and crisis management are the same in both systems – indeed, one of British Prime Minister David Cameron’s first acts when he came to power was to establish an NSC to improve coordination of policymaking. Although the establishment of the Japanese NSC is long overdue, it is not too late for Japan to benefit from the improvement in policy direction and coherence that it seems certain to bring.",
            "保护日本 东京—安倍晋三的第二次日本首相生涯以激光式地聚焦于经济复兴开始。 这一几乎从一开始就被称之为“安倍经济学”的政策由所谓的三 “支箭”组成：积极的货币政策、扩张的财政立场以及刺激私人投资的结构性改革。 东京举办2020年奥运会又在其上增加了第四支箭 — — 奥运会之前的基础设施投资和旅游收入增长。 坦白说，在经历了15年的通缩性衰退后，日本经济的复苏仍有很长的路要走。 尽管如此，安倍改革的效果已经在股市和汇率等领域开始显现。 但安倍还面临着亚洲安全环境问题，这一问题之棘手一点都不亚于安倍去年12月成为首相时面临的经济问题。 事实上，他面临着诸多与七年前首次出任首相时相同的问题。 当时，他的措施因为他自身的辞职而夭折，而如今他要第二次试图建立能满足日本（以及盟友）在21世纪亚洲所需要的国家安全治理体系。 在10月25日日本下议院全体会议讲话中，安倍晋三强调，考虑到目前亚洲安全局势 ， “ 加强指挥功能对于落实首相国家安全政策至关重要 。 ” 如今，对日本国会上下议院控制权分裂的情况已不复存在，安倍的自民党牢牢控制着两院，因此现代化日本国家安全治理的法案肯定将获得通过。 安倍晋三所提交的法案旨在成立日本国家安全委员会（Japanese National Security Council，NSC ） ， 该委员会将综合参考其他国家类似机构（如美国的国家安全委员会）的成败经验组建。 日本安全委员会（Security Council of Japan，在危机期间由相关内阁成员向首相提供建议的权宜性设置）将被重组为正式机构。 新的NSC成员将限制在首相、内阁官房长官、外相和防相，必要时还将纳入相关大臣。 首相办公室将常设一个国家安全秘书处，由外交经验丰富的人员充当首脑，并包括60名各个领域安全专家，他们将制定中长期国家安全战略的政策框架。 接着，该战略将被制作成指导原则发给日本防务和外交机构。 与其他国家一样，日本也面临着外交政策、防务和政策机构之间的管辖权限范围之争，妨碍了情报的汇总和分析。 但是，随着NSC的组建，各省和各机构将向新的秘书处报告重要国家安全情报，由后者进行综合分析，写成报告呈送首相和各部门。 当然，与其他国家一样，官僚主义是一种痼疾。 正如我们已经看到的，克服垂直整合的省和机构所带来的障碍绝非易事。 制度化需要时间，并且决不能低估其成功的重要性。 比如，新的NSC将负责与其他国家（包括日本最重要盟友美国）共享情报。 因此，确保情报得到保护将是关键问题，特别是在考虑到有将安全情报泄漏给媒体的陋习的情况下。 这就是国会同时也在考虑保密情报保护法的原因。 该法将对泄漏机密、特别是事关国家安全的机密的政府官员课以更加严厉的惩罚。 在二战之前和之间所实施的限制言论自由的法律所造成的创伤使得战后取消了所有的言论约束，这让日本成了间谍的天堂，反间谍手段和保密性严重不足。 此外，自1945年以来，和平已经持续了好几十年，这降低了政客的保密意识。 比如，日本报纸总是在第二天就报��首相在几点钟、哪里和谁共进了一次晚餐。 与美国政府的总统制相反，日本政府是议会制。 但这两套制度的国家安全和危机管理目标是一致的 — — 事实上，英国首相卡梅伦在当选后的第一批动作之一便是成立NSC以改进决策协调。 尽管日本NSC长期缺位，但对日本来说，现在成立NSC、获得它几乎必将带来的政策方向和一致性改进为时未晚。"

            "How to End an Insurgency TOKYO – When the Moro Islamic Liberation Front guerrilla movement took up arms in the Philippines in the 1960’s, Ferdinand Marcos had yet to become the country's president – let alone dictator. Despite the country’s many political transformations in the last half-century, the MILF’s campaign to achieve independence for the Bangsamoro nation – whose territory, they claim, covers the islands of Mindanao, Palawan, Sulu, and Sabah – remained constant, until President Benigno Aquino III resolved to change it. The MILF was not deterred by the popular overthrow of Marcos’s 20-year dictatorship in 1986, following the assassination of the opposition leader Benigno Aquino, Jr. Nor did the establishment of democracy – now deeply entrenched – inspire the group’s leaders to reconsider their approach. The MILF remained engaged in a brutal campaign of beheadings, assassination, kidnappings, and indiscriminate butchery. Then, last January, Aquino managed to achieve a landmark deal that finally ended Mindanao’s agony. This is one of the most remarkable feats of peacemaking in Asia since World War II, and at least as worthy of international recognition as former Finnish President and 2008 Nobel Peace Prize laureate Marti Ahtissari’s role in brokering peace in Aceh, Indonesia, in 2005. In fact, given the myriad security and political risks that Aquino ran in concluding a peace deal with the MILF, he may be an even worthier Nobel laureate. Aquino’s approach to the negotiations reflected his recognition that the MILF had twice used peace talks – once brokered by Libya’s Colonel Muammar el-Qaddafi – as a cynical ploy to buy time to regroup and raise funds (including from Al Qaeda). With freshly restocked arsenals, they would relaunch their campaign to seize Mindanao by force. Against this background, it is no surprise that, when Aquino relaunched stalled peace talks in 2012, the Filipino people were highly skeptical. But, over time, the effort gained credibility. Though questions about the peace agreement’s durability remain, with full disarmament yet to take place, the political autonomy granted to the country’s Muslim areas seems to have persuaded most MILF fighters that the time has come to end the carnage. For the people of Mindanao, this is a life-changing development. In the few short months since the peace deal was reached, Filipino and foreign investment has been flowing into the island. With nearly half of Mindanao’s population living below the poverty line, these funds could not be more critical. But the benefits of Aquino’s leadership are not limited to Mindanao. His entire presidency, which began in 2010, has been characterized by the creativity and doggedness that made peace with the MILF possible. Whereas other Filipino leaders – including Aquino’s mother, Corazon Aquino, who was elected president after Marcos’s overthrow – spoke out against corruption, Aquino has attacked it at its roots. He has brought to justice not only small-time wrongdoers – or “flies,” as Chinese President Xi Jinping’s calls such people – but also “tigers” like Senator Juan Ponce Enrile, who helped overthrow Marcos and bring Corazon Aquino to power two decades ago. As a result, the Philippines has dramatically improved its ranking in Transparency International’s annual corruption index, rising from a 134th-place tie with Nigeria in 2010, to 94th place, alongside India, last year. Aquino’s efforts to fight corruption and rebuild his country’s economic foundations has enabled the Philippines – at long last – to become Southeast Asia’s fastest-growing economy, with annual GDP growth of 7.2% last year. While growth is expected to slow slightly this year, to 6.5%, the Philippines can now be counted among Asia’s “tiger” economies. Of course, the country still has a long way to go. Some ten million Filipinos – one-quarter of the workforce ­– ­are compelled to seek employment overseas, owing to inadequate opportunities at home. If the Philippines is to attract enough investment to achieve living standards comparable to Malaysia and Thailand, Aquino must remain persistent in his efforts to open the economy and curtail corruption. Fortunately, he seems determined to do so. Aquino’s foreign policy has also been characterized by the same resoluteness. Nowhere is this more apparent than in his willingness to stand up to China’s territorial claims in the South China Sea. Indeed, the Philippines is challenging China’s claims in the International Court of Arbitration, using provisions from the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. Aquino’s stern criticism of China’s expansionist policies has certainly not endeared him to the Chinese. But regional powers like the United States and Japan have supported his stance, with Japan promising to deliver enhanced equipment for the Philippine Coast Guard. And the Filipino people undoubtedly appreciate his tenacity in protecting their interests. Aquino’s success in bringing the decades-old MILF rebellion to a peaceful end highlights a courage and tenacity that will enable him to play a key role in reining in China’s regional ambitions. Just as David’s ingenuity enabled him, against all odds, to defeat Goliath, Aquino’s bold and calculated leadership can succeed in bolstering stability and security throughout Asia by bringing China, perhaps against its will, into a rules-based regional order.",
            "怎样结束起义 东京—20世纪60年代，当莫洛伊斯兰解放阵线（Moro Islamic Liberation Front，简称MILF）游击队在菲律宾揭竿而起时，费迪南德·马科斯（Ferdinand Marcos）还没有成为总统，更不用说变成独裁者了。 尽管在过去五十年中，菲律宾发生了许多政治变化，但追求邦萨摩洛（Bangsamoro）国家独立的MILF运动一直在继续进行 — — 其领土主张包括苏禄、棉兰老、巴拉望和沙巴诸岛 — — 直到总统阿基诺三世决心改变这一情况。 MILF并没有因为1986年继反对派领袖小贝尼诺·阿基诺（Benigno Aquino, Jr . ） 遇刺而起的群众推翻马科斯20年独裁统治事件而有所退缩。 现已深入民心的民主制度的建立也没有促使MILF领导人反思其方针。 MILF仍然保持斩首、刺杀、绑架和无差别屠杀的野蛮政策。 接着，在去年1月，阿基诺三世成功地实现了终结棉兰老岛痛苦局面的里程碑式的协议。 这是自第二次世界大战以来亚洲所取得的最令人瞩目的和平协议，其价值绝不亚于前芬兰总统、2008年诺贝尔和平奖获得者马提·阿赫蒂萨里（Marti Ahtissari）在2005年印尼亚齐省和平中的调停作用。 事实上，考虑到阿基诺三世在与MILF达成和平协议中所需要面临的安全和政治风险，他更有资格获得诺贝尔奖。 阿基诺三世在谈判中所采取的方针反映出他对MILF的清醒认识 — — MILF两次利用和平谈判的机会 — — 其中一次是由利比亚的卡扎菲撮合的 — — 获得喘息，重新组织人手和筹集资金（包括来自基地组织的资金 ） ， 接着再凭借重新获得的武装重新试图武力夺取棉兰老岛。 在这样的背景下，毫不奇怪，当2012年阿基诺三世重启陷入停滞的和平谈判时，菲律宾人对此十分怀疑。 但是，随着时间的推移，阿基诺三世的努力取得了信誉。 尽管和平协议能维持多久仍然存疑，MILF也没有完全放弃武装，但授予菲律宾穆斯林地区政治自治权似乎已经让大部分MILF战士认为是时候结束杀戮了。 对棉兰老人民来说，这是一个改变生命的变局。 自和平协议达成以来的几个月里，菲律宾和外国投资持续流入棉兰老岛。 棉兰老岛人口有近一半生活在贫困线以下，因此这笔流入可谓无比重要。 但获得阿基诺三世领导力好处的并不只有棉兰老岛。 在2010年开始的总统生涯中，他以创新和顽强使得与MILF的和平成为可能。 其他菲律宾领导人 — — 包括阿基诺三世之母、在推翻马科斯后当选为总统的柯拉蓉·阿基诺（Corazon Aquino）在内 — — 只是口头反腐，而阿基诺三世直击腐败的根源。 他不但将位卑权小的犯错者 — — 即中国国家主席习近平所谓的“苍蝇”送上法庭，也没有放过参议员胡安·旁斯·恩里莱（Juan Ponce Enrile）这样的“老虎 ” 。 二十年前，恩里莱在推翻马科斯和柯丽蓉·阿基诺问鼎权力过程中立下过汗马功劳。 而菲律宾也得以大大提高了其在透明国际（Transparency International）年度腐败排行榜上的排名，从 2010年的134名（与尼日利亚相当）上升到去年的第94名（与印度并列 ） 。 阿基诺三世打击腐败、重建国家经济基础的努力让菲律宾在多年后终于成为东南亚增长最快的经济体，去年GDP增长率达到了7.2 % 。 尽管今年增长率预计将略有放缓（6.5%左右）但仍可以名列亚洲“小龙”行列。 当然，菲律宾仍有很长的路要走。 一千万菲律宾人 — — 相当于劳动力的四分之一 — — 被迫远赴海外寻找工作，因为国内机会太少。 如果菲律宾想要吸引足够的投资以实现与马来西亚和泰国相当的生活水平，阿基诺三世就必须在任期内继续开放经济和打���腐败的政策。 幸运的是，他似乎也决心要这样做。 阿基诺三世的外交政策也带有同样的决心。 最能说明这一点的莫过于他坚定抵制中国在南海的领土助长。 事实上，菲律宾正在援引联合国海洋法公约（Convention on the Law of the Sea）向国际仲裁法院起诉中国。 阿基诺三世对中国扩张主义政策的严厉批评当然让中国人十分不欢迎。 但美国和日本等地区大国都支持他的立场，日本还承诺为菲律宾海岸警卫队提供加强装备。 菲律宾人民毫无疑问也很欣赏他在捍卫国家利益上的坚定。 阿基诺三世成功地将维持了几十年的MILF起义引向和平结束，这充分表现出令他能够在遏制中国地区野心中扮演关键角色的勇气和韧性。 正如大卫（David）的巧思让他能够破除万难战胜歌利亚（Goliath ） ， 阿基诺三世有勇有谋的领导也能够对中国敲山震虎，从而促进整个亚洲的稳定与安全。"

            "Japan’s Russian Dilemma TOKYO – For Japanese leaders and citizens, President Vladimir Putin’s brutal annexation of Crimea was an unsurprising return to the normal paradigm of Russian history. Indeed, most Japanese regard the move as having been determined by some expansionist gene in Russia’s political DNA, rather than by Putin himself or the specifics of the Ukraine crisis. Japan is particularly concerned with Russian expansionism, because it is the only G-7 country that currently has a territorial dispute with Russia, which has occupied its Northern Territories since the waning days of World War II. That occupation began between August 28 and September 5, 1945, when the Soviet Union hurriedly nullified the existing Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Treaty and invaded not only Japanese-occupied Manchuria, but also southern Sakhalin Island and the ancient Japanese territories of Etorofu Island, Kunashiri Island, Shikotan Island, and the Habomai Islands. Concerned that America’s development and use of atomic weapons against Japan would deprive the Soviet Union of any territorial gains in the east, Stalin ordered the Red Army to invade. But Japan, having already endured the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, had accepted the Potsdam Declaration on August 14, meaning that the war was already over when the Red Army marched in. Since then, these islands have been controlled by either the Soviet Union or its successor state, Russia. And, as elsewhere in Russia, their residents have been impoverished by consistently incompetent and corrupt government, whether run by Communists or today’s crony capitalists. In a strange historical twist, given the Crimean annexation, after the Japanese citizens native to the Northern Territories were killed or expelled, many Ukrainians were brought to the islands during the Soviet years, and still live there. If an independence referendum were to be held on Etorofu Island, where some 60% of the inhabitants have roots in Ukraine, I wonder whether Putin would accept the result as readily as he did the ballot in Crimea, undertaken at the barrel of a gun? After coming to power at the end of 2012, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe had sought to improve relations with Putin in the hope of beginning serious talks on the Northern Territories. But now that Putin has made his project of imperial restoration crystal clear, those hopes are stillborn. Recognizing this, Abe condemned the annexation of Crimea, calling it “a violation of Ukraine’s integrity and the integrity of its sovereignty and territory.” Abe added that “attempts to change the status quo by force cannot be overlooked,” and that Japan would consider further economic sanctions against Russia in cooperation with the G-7. Needless to say, these remarks underscored the fact that Japanese territory and territorial waters are being threatened “by force” in the East China Sea by China. The lesson now being drawn is that, where territorial disputes are concerned, Japan must not kowtow to “attempts to change the status quo backed by force.” China’s response to the crisis in Ukraine was particularly revealing. For three decades, China has proclaimed “non-interference” in the internal affairs of sovereign states as the most important rule governing international relations. But when Putin invaded Ukraine, China showed the hollowness of its adherence to this principle. Instead of condemning Russia for invading and annexing Crimea, it abstained at the United Nations Security Council, and has offered more criticism of Ukraine’s new popular government than it has of Putin’s thuggish behavior. Every country in Asia is bound to draw only one conclusion from China’s tacit approval of Putin’s Crimean land grab: China, too, thinks that might makes right, and if it believes that it can get away with invading disputed territories, whether in the South China Sea or in the Indian Himalayas, it will do so. As a result, effective deterrence will require Asian countries to strengthen their defenses and unite to demand adherence to international law, so that China understands that any Putin-style land grabs will cost its economy dearly. In the immediate future, Japan will work with the G-7 to ensure that Putin’s reckless ambitions do not endanger other parts of Ukraine. Already, Japan has decided to provide ¥150 billion ($1.5 billion) in economic aid for Ukraine, the largest pledge by any individual country, including the US, thus far. Before the Crimea invasion, territorial negotiations between Japan and Russia showed signs of progress. Moreover, several bilateral economic cooperation efforts, such as projects involving liquefied natural gas, were moving forward. But it is now clear not only that Putin is returning Russia to the stagnation of the late-Soviet era, but also that he subscribes to former Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev’s dictum that “what we have, we hold.” So Putin’s talk about reaching an agreement with Japan on the Northern Territories was likely as mendacious as his claims that Russians in Crimea were in peril, and thus in need of protection by Russian troops. More important, Japan understands that business as usual with an aggressive Russia that undermines the international order could embolden others closer to home to embrace Putin’s lawless tactics. The days of an inward looking Japan are over. Japan now sees threats elsewhere in the world in the context of its own security, and will react appropriately.",
            "日本的俄罗斯困境 东京—对日本领导人和日本人民来说，普京总统的悍然吞并克里米亚只不过是对俄罗斯历史常规范式的正常回归。 事实上，大部分日本人这一举动是由存在于俄罗斯政治DNA中的扩张主义基因决定的，而不是由普京本人或乌克兰危机的具体环境决定的。 日本特别担心俄罗斯的扩展主义，因为日本是七国集团中唯一目前与俄罗斯存在领土纠纷的国家，自二战末期以来，北方四岛便一直由俄罗斯占领。 其占领史始于1945年8月28日至9月5日期间，当时苏联匆忙撕毁苏日中立条约，不但入侵了日占满洲，还攻占了库页岛南部和日本固有领土择捉岛、国后岛、色丹岛和齿舞群岛。 由于担心美国开发和对日本动用原子弹将导致苏联在东线获得领土尽失，斯大林下令红军入侵。 但已在广岛和长崎经历了两次原子弹轰炸的日本在8月14日接受了波茨坦公告，这意味着在红军开进时，战争已经结束了。 至此以后，这些岛屿一直被苏联及其继承国俄罗斯控制。 和俄罗斯的其他地区一样，这些岛屿上的居民因为无能和腐败的政府而遭受着贫穷，不管统治者是以前的共产党还是今天的权贵资本家。 这是一个奇怪的历史扭曲。 在日本北方四岛被占领后，岛上的日本原住民或者被杀，或者被逐，而许多乌克兰人在苏联时代移民到这些岛上，至今仍生活在那里。 而现在，克里米亚也被吞并了。 如果在乌克兰裔居民占60%的择捉岛举行独立公投，我怀疑普京还能不能像接受拿枪顶着的克里米亚公投结果那样踌躇满志。 自2012年底执政以来，日本首相安倍晋三一直在寻求改善与普京的关系，希望开启关于北方四岛的严肃谈判。 但如今普京的重建帝国工程已是人所共知，安倍的希望也已胎死腹中。 认识到这一点，安倍谴责了对克里米亚的吞并，称之“破坏了乌克兰统一和主权和领土完整 ” 。 安倍还说 ， “ 用武力改变现状的企图决不可忽视 ” ， 日本将考虑与七国集团合作进一步对俄罗斯实施经济制裁。 不消说，这一评论遥相呼应了一个事实：日本在东海的领土和领海正在被中国“武力”威胁。 现在的教训是，在领土纠纷问题上，日本决不可屈服于“用武力改变现状的企图 ” 。 中国对乌克兰危机的反应很能说明问题。 三十年来，中国一直强调“不干预”主权国家内部事务是最重要的国际关系准则。 但中国并没有谴责俄罗斯入侵并吞并克里米亚，而是在联合国安理会投了弃权票，更多地批评乌克兰新选出的政府而不是普京的暴行。 每一个亚洲国家从中国对普京吞并克里米亚领土的默认中只能得出一个结论：中国也认为这是正确的，并且如果它认为可以侥幸成功地入侵纠纷领土时 — — 不管是南海还是印度喜马拉雅地区 — — 它也会这么做。 因此，有效的威慑要求亚洲国家加强防务，并团结起来要求遵守国际法，从而让中国明白，普京使的领土掠夺将付出沉重的经济代价。 眼下，日本将继续与七国集团合作，确保普京的野蛮野心不会威胁到乌克兰的其他部分。 日本已经决定向乌克兰提供1,500亿日元的经济援助，这是到目前为止包括美国在内的最大一笔单国援助承诺。 在入侵克里米亚前，日本和俄罗斯的领土谈判表现出进展信号。 此外，一些双边经济合作计划，如与��化天然气有关的项目也在推进。 但如今，显然不仅普京让俄罗斯回到了苏联末期的停滞时期，并且他还在按照前苏联领导人勃列日涅夫的“我们有的就要捍卫”的格言行事。 因此，普金所谓的与日本就北方四岛达成协议完全是个谎言，一如他宣称克里米亚的俄罗斯族面临着危险因此需要派遣俄罗斯军队予以保护。 更重要的是，日本明白，像什么都没发生过一样继续正常与破坏了国际秩序的俄罗斯打交道将让更近的近邻效仿普京目无法律的做法。 对日本来说，向内看的时期已经结束了。 现在，日本在其自身安全环境中看到了来自世界其他地方的威胁，并将采取相应行动。"

            "Abenomics’ Women Problem TOKYO – When Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe addressed the United Nations General Assembly last week, he emphasized his determination to build a society in which women shine. Indeed, creating opportunities for women in the workforce is an essential pillar of the government’s reform program, so-called “Abenomics.” Abe is clearly on the right track. According to an analysis by researchers at Goldman Sachs, closing the gender gap could boost GDP by 9% in the United States and nearly 13% in Japan. During his stay in New York, Abe also discussed “womenomics” with Hillary Clinton, who had made empowering women in the economy a key policy goal during her tenure as US Secretary of State. Abe, strange to say, is the first Japanese leader to grasp that the underutilization of women’s skills has been holding back Japan’s economy. Japan ranked 105th out of 136 countries in the World Economic Forum’s “Global Gender Gap Report 2013,” down from 101st place in 2012. The problem begins in Abe’s own domain – politics. In his cabinet reshuffle earlier this month, five female ministers were appointed, but in the face of strong opposition from male MPs. More important, the appointments amounted to painting over the cracks: Only 39 of the 480 members of the Japanese Diet’s lower house, or 7.9%, are women. The Inter-Parliamentary Union ranks Japan 158th out of 189 countries in terms of its ratio of female MPs. Things are just as bad at lower levels of government, where women account for a mere 13.1% of representatives in local parliaments, more than 40% of which have no female members at all. As the leader of the Liberal Democratic Party, Abe should instruct local party branches to choose more female candidates to run in next April’s local elections. But, at least so far, Abe seems to lack the will to do so (though he may choose to work with local party bosses behind the scenes to bring in more women). It is also worrying that some of the women Abe has selected for his cabinet and for key party posts are arch-conservatives who advocate that women stay at home and take care of children. Given this, one cannot help feeling uncertain about the credibility of his womenomics initiatives. That is especially true when one considers the lack of women in corporate management positions. Everyone at the meeting of the Keidanren, the Federation of Economic Organizations, to welcome US Ambassador Caroline Kennedy were men in dark suits. In 2003, Norway revised its corporation law to state that companies that failed to place women in 40% of management positions could face delisting. If the same law were applied to Japan today, every company would be delisted. Women currently hold an estimated 9% of senior management positions in Japan, compared to 40% in the Philippines, 24% in France, and 22% in the United States. One reason that Japan’s consumer electronics manufacturers are no longer world-beaters is that they have not fully used their female employees in managerial positions, despite their varied experiences. The exceptions are instructive. When Akira Matsumoto became CEO of the Japanese snack manufacturer Calbee, he began appointing both female executives and foreigners to the company’s leadership. Revenues and earnings have increased, and net sales have grown threefold. Though there is no proof that the former caused the latter, Matsumoto’s commitment to lead in this area suggests that corporate dynamism may well increase with a more prominent role for women. Likewise, Daiwa Securities CEO Shigeharu Suzuki has appointed women as executive officers to improve sales capabilities, with promising results. Although the employment rate of women in Japan reached 69.5% in 2013, more than 60% of women leave the workplace prematurely, mostly owing to childbirth. This pattern results from institutional impediments to achieving a viable work-family balance – impediments that embody the harsh view of male superiors and colleagues toward working mothers. Changing this view is not easy, because the Confucian belief that women belong in the home remains embedded in Japanese and some other Asian societies. Moreover, most of the people participating in forums or workshops focused on womenomics are women; too often, these events simply turn into platforms for women to complain among themselves. Abe’s womenomics will not work unless and until Japanese men change their thinking. If Abenomics is now stalling, as many fear, the reason may be found in a lack of capacity to implement the policies put forward, particularly with respect to women. Indeed, the key to Abenomics’ success or failure may turn out to be whether the Japanese people are convinced that women are essential to their country’s economic revival, and are willing to support an earnest effort to establish institutions that support working women.",
            "安倍经济学的妇女问题 东京—在上周的联合国大会演讲中，日本首相安倍晋三强调了建设让妇女放出光芒的社会的决心。 事实上，为参与劳动力大军的妇女创造机会是日本政府的改革方案，即所谓的“安倍经济学 ” （ Abenomics）的重要支柱。 显然，安倍的方向是正确的。 根据高盛（Goldman Sacks）研究人员的分析，缩小性别差异将给美国带来9%的GDP提振，给日本则能带来13 % 。 在纽约之行期间，安倍也与希拉里·克林顿讨论了“妇女经济学 ” 。 在担任美国国务卿期间，希拉里·克林顿将加强妇女在经济中的地位作为一项重要政策目标。 说来令人奇怪，安倍是第一个认识到妇女技能利用不足一直在拖累日本经济的日本领导人。 在世界经济论坛（World Economic Forum）的《2013年全球性别差异报告 》 （ Global Gender Gap Report 2013）中，日本名列136个国家的第150位，较2012年的第101位有所下降。 问题起始于安倍自己的领域 — — 政治。 在其本月重新改组的内阁中，有五名女性大臣被任命，但这一决定受到了男性国会议员的强烈反对。 更重要的是，此次任命有欲盖弥彰的嫌疑：在日本众议院的480个议席中，只有39个（或7.9 % ） 为妇女。 从妇女占议员总数比例看，日本名列国际议会联盟（Inter-Parliamentary Union）189个国家的第158位。 低级别政府的情况也一样糟糕，妇女只占地方议会代表的13.1 % ， 有40%的选区一名妇女议员都没有。 作为自民党领袖，安倍应该要求地方党分支选择更多妇女候选人参加明年4月的地方选举。 但是，至少到目前为止，安倍似乎没有这样做的意愿（尽管他可能与地方党组织领导人达成幕后交易，提拔更多女性 ） 。 另一个令人担心之处是一些被安倍选为内阁成员和党内重要职务人选的妇女是极端保守派，认为妇女应该呆在家里带孩子。 基于此，我们无法不对其妇女经济学计划的可信性产生疑问。 考虑到妇女在公司管理职位上的劣势，这一点更加明显了。 出席经团联会议欢迎美国大使卡洛琳·肯尼迪（Caroline Kennedy）的清一色都是男性。 2003年，挪威修改了其公司法，管理岗位妇女比例不到40%的公司将可能面临摘牌下市的风险。 如果今天日本也采取相同的法律，那么所有公司都得摘牌下市。 据估计，目前妇女只占日本高级管理职位的9 % ， 而菲律宾为40 % ， 法国为24 % ， 美国为22 % 。 日本消费电子产品制造商不再能够执世界之牛耳的一个原因就在于它们没有充分利用管理岗位上的妇女员工，尽管她们拥有丰富的经验。 例外最具有说明性。 松本彰（Akira Matsumoto）成为日本快餐公司卡鲁比（Calbee）CEO后，任命女性高管和外国人担任公司领导层。 此后，收入和利润都有所上升，净销售额翻了三倍。 尽管不能证明是前者带来了后者，但松本在这方面的敢为天下先先表明，让女性扮演更加主要角色可能让公司活力大增。 类似地，大和证券（Akira Matsumoto）CEO铃木茂晴（Shigeharu Suzuki）任命女性为公私高管以改善销售能力，结果令人欣喜。 尽管2013年日本妇女就业率达到了69.5 % ， 但60%多的妇女过早退出了劳动力大军，主要原因是为了照顾孩子。 这一模式的根源在于阻碍视线工作-家庭平衡的制度障碍 — — 男性上司和同事对生了孩子还上班的母亲十分反感。 改变这一观念绝不容易，因为妇女应该持家的儒家思想仍深深地植根于日本也其他一下亚洲国家。 此外，大部分参加妇女经济学论坛和讨论组的人都是妇女；这些最后往往沦为妇女之间彼此抱怨的平台。 在日本男性改变思想之前，安倍的妇女经济学不会奏效。 如果现在安倍经济学如同很多人所担心的那样停滞下来，其原因或许可以从缺乏推行政策特别是妇女政策的能力。 事实上，安倍经济学成败的关键也许是日本民族是否相信妇女对这个国家的经济复兴至关重要，并愿意支持建设支持职业妇女的制度的努力。"

            "Tipping Points to Asia’s Future TOKYO – A week, it is said, is a long time in politics. But events in Asia over the past week may define the region for decades to come. Thailand, one of Asia’s most prosperous countries, seems determined to render itself a basket case. A military coup, imposed following the Thai constitutional court’s ouster of an elected government on spurious legal grounds, can lead only to an artificial peace. Unless Thailand’s military is prepared to serve as a truly honest broker between deposed Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra (and her supporters) and the anti-democratic Bangkok elite, which has sought a right to permanent minority rule, today’s calm may give way to a new and more dangerous storm. To Thailand’s east, Vietnam is the latest Asian country to feel pinched by China’s policy of creating facts on the ground, or in this case at sea, to enhance its sovereignty claims on disputed territory. Vietnam’s government reacted vigorously to China’s placement of a huge, exploratory oilrig near the disputed Paracel Islands in the South China Sea. Ordinary Vietnamese, taking matters into their own hands, reacted even more vigorously, by rioting and targeting Chinese industrial investments for attack. China’s unilateral behavior has exposed a strain of virulent anti-Chinese sentiment bubbling beneath the surface in many Asian countries. Renewed protests over China’s mining investments in Myanmar this week confirmed this trend, one that China’s leaders seem either to dismiss as trivial, or to regard as somehow unrelated to their bullying. Indeed, like Russian President Vladimir Putin, who faces widespread public antipathy in Ukraine, China’s leaders appear to believe that popular protests against them can only be the product of an American plot. Yet, despite their shared contempt for expressions of the popular will, China’s President Xi Jinping and Putin struggled, during Putin’s two-day visit to Shanghai, to agree on a new gas deal that the Kremlin desperately needs. Putin had viewed China as his backup option should the West seek to isolate Russia following its annexation of Crimea. Putin’s idea was that he could pivot Russia’s economy into a partnership with China. But Xi balked, signing the gas agreement only after Putin offered a steep, long-term discount. Xi’s self-confidence reflected not only the Chinese leadership’s contempt for Putin’s mismanagement of the Russian economy, but also the fact that China’s energy worries have lessened considerably of late. Successful deployment of hydraulic fracturing (“fracking”) technology in Xinjiang suggests that China, like America, will soon be able to draw on its own reserves of shale energy. Moreover, plentiful gas supplies from Myanmar and Central Asia will provide China with sufficient supplies of energy for at least a decade. China’s hard bargaining with Russia has exposed the limits of the two countries’ bilateral cooperation, which has important geo-strategic consequences for Asia and the world. China, it now seems, is happy to see Putin poke his finger in the West’s eye and challenge America’s global leadership. But it is not willing to underwrite with hard cash Russian pretensions to world power status. Instead, China appears interested in turning Russia into the sort of vassal state that Putin is seeking to create in Ukraine. But the most epochal events of the last week took place in two of Asia’s great democracies: India and Japan. Narendra Modi’s landslide victory in India’s general election was not only a huge personal triumph for the son of a tea seller, but may well mark a decisive break with India’s traditional inward-looking policies. Modi is determined to reform India’s economy and lead the country into the front rank of world powers. Here, Modi will find no stauncher ally than Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who was among the first Asian leaders to embrace him in his bid to lead India. Given that both countries have almost perfectly aligned regional security interests, there should be plenty of scope for the two to act in tandem to improve regional security and mutual prosperity. Thailand’s crisis might well mark a good early test of their ability to work together, because both countries have strong interests in Thailand’s rapid return to democracy and the credibility needed to act as an honest broker in ending the country’s crisis. In the past week, Abe created for himself considerably more political space to act as a strategic partner, not only to India, but also to Japan’s other allies, particularly the United States. Quietly, a panel appointed by Abe’s government this week offered a reinterpretation of a key element of Article 9 of Japan’s constitution. For the first time since the Pacific War’s end in 1945, Japan’s Self-Defense Forces would be able to participate in “collective self-defense” – meaning that Japan could come to the aid of its allies should they come under attack. Of course, China and others in Asia have tried to muddy this change with the alarmist charge of a return to Japanese militarism. But the new interpretation of Article 9 augurs just the opposite: it embeds Japan’s military within an alliance system that has been, and will remain, the backbone of Asia’s prevailing structure of peace. Abe will make this clear when he delivers the keynote address in Singapore at this year’s Shangri La Dialogue, the annual meeting of Asian military and civilian military leaders. Modi’s victory and Abe’s increased ability to stand by Japan’s allies can help to forge deeper bilateral ties and, if properly understood by China, foster a greater strategic equilibrium in the region. It is now possible for Asia’s greatest powers – China, India, Japan, and the US – to form something akin to the concert system that gave Europe a century of almost complete peace in the nineteenth century. Of course, such a system would require China to set aside its goal of regional hegemony. Clear-sighted Chinese must already see that, short of a victorious war, such dominance is impossible. Now is the moment for China to anchor its rise within a stable and mutually acceptable Asian regional order. Indeed, for China, this may be the ultimate tipping point in its modernization.",
            "亚洲未来的关键点 东京—据说一周的时间在政治界已经算得上长期了。 但过去一周在亚洲发生的事件可能决定着该地区的未来几十年。 亚洲最繁荣的国家之一泰国似乎铁了心要自断手脚。 在泰国宪法法院以可疑法律依据驱逐民选政府后，军事政变只能带来人为的平衡。 除非泰国军方准备充当被推翻的总理英拉（及其支持者）和反民主的曼谷精英（正在追求永久的少数派统治）之间的真诚的牵线人，否则今天的平静将让位给新的危险风暴。 泰国以东，越南是中国捏造土地事实 — — 对越南来说是海洋事实 — — 推行其在争议领土主权主张的最新的不堪忍受者。 越南政府对中国在存在争议的南海西沙群岛设置巨型钻井平台的反应非常强烈，而自力更生的普通越南人民的反应甚至更加强烈，掀起了针对中国产业投资的暴乱。 中国的单方面行为将掩盖在许多亚洲国家平静表面下的汹涌的反中情绪揭开了一丝。 本周在缅甸发生的新一轮针对中国矿业投资的示威确认了这一趋势，而中国领导要么认为这一无关紧要，要么认为这与其恃强凌弱的行为没有什么关系。 事实上，与在乌克兰饱受千夫所指的俄罗斯总统普京一样，中国领导人似乎认为针对他们的群众示威只不过是美国人煽动的产物。 但是，尽管都对汹涌的群情嗤之以鼻，但中国国家主席习近平和普京仍在普京的两日上海之行中就克里姆林宫所急需的天然气合同展开了一番明争暗斗。 普京将中国视为西方在其吞并克里米亚后寻求孤立俄罗斯时的备选项。 普京的算盘是他可以将俄罗斯经济的支点放在与中国的伙伴关系上。 但习近平并不买账，在普京给出了很大的长期折扣后才签署了天然气协议。 习近平的自信不但反映出中国领导层对普京治理俄罗斯经济不力的不屑，也体现了中国能源顾虑最近已大为缓解的事实。 液压致裂法在新疆的成功应用意味着中国与美国一样，很快就将能够利用其自身的页岩能源储备。 此外，来自缅甸和中亚的充足的天然气供应至少在十年内可以让中国没有供应短缺之忧。 中国的强势还价暴露出两国双边合作的局限性，而这对亚洲和世界具有重要的地缘战略影响。 中国似乎乐于见到普京与西方顶牛、挑战美国的全球领导。 但它不愿拿出真金白银支持俄罗斯的全球霸权之争。 相反，中国似乎更愿意让俄罗斯成为附庸国，一如普京对乌克兰的算盘。 但上周最具划时代意义的事件发生在亚洲的两个民主大国：印度和日本。 纳兰德拉·莫迪在印度大选中获得压倒性胜利，这不仅是这位茶商之子个人的辉煌胜利，也标志着印度传统内向政策的决定性突破。 莫迪决心改革印度经济，让印度走向世界强国前列。 在这方面，莫迪最坚定的盟友莫过于日本首相安倍晋三。 安倍晋三是最早支持莫迪领导印度的亚洲领导人之一。 两国拥有几乎完美一致的安全利益，因此有充分的空间携手并进改善地区安全、增进共同繁荣。 泰国危机或许是很好的共事能力早期测试，因为泰国迅速回归民主十分符合两国的利益，并且两国也拥有作为终结泰国危机的真诚牵线人所必须具备的信誉。 在过去一周里，安倍为自己创造很大的以战略合作伙伴身份施展的政治空间 — — 不仅是对印度，也包括日本的其他盟国，特别是美国。 本周，安倍政府悄然任命的小组对日本宪法第九条的一项关键要素做出了重新解释。 自1945年太平洋战争以来，日本自卫队将首次能够参与“集体自卫 ” — —这意味着日本可以在盟国受到袭击是给予支援。 当然，中国和其他亚洲国家试图阻止这一变化，它们认��这是日本回归军国主义的危险信号。 但对宪法第九条的新解释的意义与此正好相反：它将日本的军力嵌入了一个联盟体系，这一体系一直是、将来也会是亚洲和平结构的基石。 安倍将在今年新加坡香格里拉对话（Shangri La Dialogue）的政策演说中阐释这一点。 香格里拉对话是亚洲军事和文职领导人年会。 莫迪的胜利以及安倍与日本盟友携手能力的日增有助于深化双边关系，如果中国能够恰当地理解这一点，更有助于形成更大的地区战略均衡。 如今，亚洲地区最大的国家 — — 中国、印度、日本和美国 — — 有望形成堪与给十九世纪给欧洲带来近一百年和平的体系相媲美的合作体系。 当然，这样一套体系需要中国放下其地区霸权目标。 头脑清醒的中国人必须看到，不通过大胜仗获得这一主导权是不可能的。 如今，中国应该将其崛起的基础定在稳定的、可互相接受的亚洲地区秩序上。 事实上，对中国来说，这将是其现代化进程中的终极关键点。"

            "The Road to Slovyansk TOKYO – The Ukraine crisis has demonstrated that one person alone can endanger world peace. But that one person might not be Russian President Vladimir Putin, who in reality only leads a large regional power that, owing to his authoritarian rule and muddled economics, is a long-term threat more to itself than to the world. No, the lone actor most responsible for threatening world peace might unwittingly be US President Barack Obama, with his scholarly inertia and apparent disregard for the fate of smaller, faraway countries. Of course, Obama is not responsible for Russia’s invasion and annexation of Crimea, or for Putin’s massing of Russian troops on Ukraine’s eastern border in an effort to intimidate the government in Kyiv. Nor is Obama alone in crafting a Western policy of appeasement by default. German Chancellor Angela Merkel also bears considerable responsibility: Her tough rhetoric masks a largely business-as-usual approach that reflects her country’s dependence on Russian gas supplies. But Obama is responsible for his administration’s apparent indifference to the fate of the American-built order that has governed world affairs since the end of World War II. Unless he toughens his policies, the rules and norms that have guaranteed peace for so many for so long could lose their force. The utter disconnect between America’s diplomatic principles and practice has become so great that it is emboldening the country’s adversaries. That is why, following Russia’s illegal seizure and annexation of Crimea, Putin is now trying to mold Ukraine’s eastern provinces into vassal regions, if not foment irredentism, in order to realize his dream of reconstituting the Russian empire. But it is not only America’s rivals who are taking note of Obama’s passivity. The United States’ closest allies are also watching nervously, and the conclusions they appear to be drawing could harm its national security interests severely in the years and decades to come. Consider the Middle East, where Saudi Arabia is already openly questioning the reliability of the Kingdom’s historic US defense guarantee. And US Secretary of State John Kerry’s “guidance” for a settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which should have been unveiled this month, will now remain under wraps. Speculation abounded that Kerry’s proposal would contain a specific US guarantee of Israel’s borders. But can anyone imagine Israelis taking America at its word after watching the US dither while Russia redrew the map of Ukraine? In the Budapest Memorandum of 1994, the US, together with the United Kingdom and Russia, guaranteed Ukraine’s territorial integrity in exchange for its surrender of the large nuclear arsenal it inherited from the Soviet Union. Now that the US has disregarded its obligation to Ukraine – reportedly unwilling even to share intelligence with its government on Russian troop movements, much less supply the country with the means to defend itself – all bets are off concerning an American guarantee of Israel’s security and territorial integrity. For that matter, why should Iran discontinue its nuclear program when it sees the ease with which Ukraine was dismembered? After all, the Iranians have borne far harsher sanctions than those imposed on Russia so far. By acquiescing in Russia’s seizure of Crimea, the US may also see core alliances begin to unravel. For example, the US has openly stated that it will defend Japan should China forcibly seize the disputed Senkaku Islands. But if America can evade its guarantee of Ukraine’s territorial integrity, why should Japan’s leaders believe that it will do otherwise in the case of a far-flung cluster of uninhabited islands that are scarcely more than rocks inhabited by sheep? US Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel heard an earful of official doubt about the credibility of America’s defense commitment during his recent visit to Japan. Obama is certain to hear more of the same in Tokyo this week. Of course, the US is no longer in a position to “pay any price…to secure the survival and the success of liberty,” as John F. Kennedy put it in his inaugural address – not in Ukraine, and not anywhere else. The huge price of its wars in Afghanistan and Iraq has understandably made the US war-weary. Moreover, no country has the right to expect Americans to fight and die on its territory for its freedom. But has the US become so withdrawn from the world that it is willing to pay only a symbolic price, such as that implied by Russia’s tit-for-tat sanctions, to stop aggression that threatens the international order? Have America’s recent foreign wars so scarred its leaders that they are unable to defend the world order that their predecessors created and for which many Americans have died? The time is growing short for the US to demonstrate anew – to friend and foe alike – that its word remains its bond. Unless Russia honors the accord recently reached in Geneva to defuse the Ukraine crisis, the US must use – and soon – its full arsenal of non-military means to demonstrate to Putin the costs, and folly, of his 1930’s-style revanchism. The soft underbelly of Putin’s imperial ambitions is Russia’s brittle and undiversified economy, and the expectations of ordinary Russians for improved living standards. The US and the European Union need to demonstrate clearly to the Russian people that their president’s policies will mean a likely return to the poverty and tyranny of the Soviet era. Any lesser display of resolve may fatally weaken the bedrock of Western security – and that of the world.",
            "通往斯洛夫扬斯克之路 东京—乌克兰危机表明，一个人就可以威胁到世界和平。 但这个人或许不是俄罗斯总统普京，他其实只不过是一个地区大国的领导人，由于独裁和混乱的经济政策，对他自己的国家的威胁比世界更大。 不，你或许没有感觉到，最能威胁世界和平的个人乃是美国总统奥巴马，以及他的智识保守（scholarly inertia）和对遥远的小国命运的冷漠。 当然，奥巴马不必为俄罗斯入侵和吞并克里米亚负责，也不必为普京在乌克兰东境集结俄军以恐吓基辅政府负责。 奥巴马也无法单枪匹马地决定西方默认的绥靖政策。 德国总理默克尔也需要承担大量责任：她嘴上厉害，实际上实施的却是老方一帖，这体现出德国对俄罗斯天然气供应的依赖。 但奥巴马需要负责的是其政府对美国所建立的秩序的冷漠。 自二战以来，这一秩序便一直决定着国际事务。 除非他收紧政策，否则保障了多年和平的规则和规范可能失去约束力。 美国外交原则与实践之间的严重脱节已经导致美国对手胆子越来越大。 正因如此，在俄罗斯非法掠夺和吞并了克里米亚后，如今普京又在觊觎将乌克兰东部省份揽为俄罗斯的附庸，甚至想煽动民族统一主义，以实现他的重铸俄罗斯帝国之梦。 但并非只有美国的对手在注意奥巴马的消极。 美国最紧密的盟友也在严重关注，而它们可能得到的结论将严重威胁到未来几年到几十年美国的国家安全利益。 以中东为例。 对沙特阿拉伯已经公开质疑长期以来美国对其安全保证的可靠性。 而本应在本月披露的美国国务卿约翰·克里对以色列-巴勒斯坦冲突和解的“指导方针”迟迟无法露面。 人们纷纷猜测克里的方案将包括美国对以色列边界的具体保证。 但以色列人在目睹了美国对俄罗斯吞并乌克兰领土默不作声后还会相信美国的保证吗？ 在1994年的布达佩斯备忘录（Budapest Memorandum）中，美国与英国和俄罗斯一起承诺保证乌克兰的领土完整，以换取后者交出其继承自苏联的庞大核武库。 如今，美国食言了其对乌克兰的义务 — — 据说连与乌克兰政府分享关于俄军动向的情报都不愿意，更不用说为乌克兰提供自我防卫的帮助了 — — 人们为何还要相信美国对以色列安全和领土完整的保证呢。 既然如此，在目睹了乌克兰被轻易肢解后，伊朗为何还要暂停其核计划呢？ 毕竟，伊朗人所承受的制裁比目前的俄罗斯大得多。 默许俄罗斯侵占克里米亚的美国可能还将看到盟友开始与它渐行渐远。 比如，美国公开声明如果中国使用武力侵占争议的钓鱼岛，它将捍卫日本。 但既然美国可以回避保证乌克兰领土完整的义务，日本领导人又为何要相信它会在荒无人烟、只有礁石和绵羊的的边远群岛钓鱼岛问题上区别对待呢？ 在最近的访日之旅中，美国国防部长查克·哈格尔已经听到了对美国防务承诺信誉的严重官方质疑。 本周访问东京的奥巴马必然会听到更多相同的质疑。 当然，美国已不再会如约翰·F·肯尼迪在其就职演说中所说的“不惜一切代价 … … 确保自由的生存和成功 ” — —不管是在乌克兰还是在别的地区。 不难理解，阿富汗和伊拉克战争的巨大代价让美国有了厌战情绪。 此外，没有哪个国家有权利要求美国人在它的领土上为它的自由战斗和牺牲。 但如若美国变得不再热心于世界事务，只愿意付出象��性的代价 — — 俄罗斯的以牙还牙式的制裁就是明证 — — 来阻止威胁到国际社会的入侵会怎样？ 美国最近的对外战争让其领导人如此恐慌，以至于他们无法捍卫前辈所创造的、无数美国人为之献身的世界秩序了吗？ 留给美国重新向它的盟友和敌人证明它言出必行的时间越来越少了。 除非俄罗斯尊重最近在日内瓦达成的乌克兰危机解决方案，否则美国必须使用 — — 并且立刻使用 — — 全面的非军事手段向普京证明他的20世纪30年代式的复仇主义是多么愚蠢、代价多么高昂。 普京的帝国野心的弱点在于俄罗斯经济的脆弱性和单一性，以及普通俄罗斯人改善生活水平的期望。 美国和欧盟需要让俄罗斯人民清楚地证明，他们的总统的政策意味着可能回到苏联时代的贫困和暴政。 如果不表现出坚定的决心，就有可能削弱西方 — — 以及世界 — — 安全的基础。"

            "The Pyongyang Purge TOKYO – During the Cold War, the term “Kremlinology” referred to efforts to understand what was taking place at the commanding heights of the Soviet Union – indeed, behind the entire Iron Curtain. Kremlinologists monitored (in whatever way possible) who was up and who was down among the core Soviet leadership. Great significance was read into who signed an official document, or who stood where atop Lenin’s Tomb in Red Square when reviewing military parades. All of that was grammar-school stuff compared to efforts to decipher the regime in North Korea, where the truth is far more opaque. Consider what happened on December 17. Choe Ryong-hae, Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission of the Korean Workers’ Party, was conspicuously present on stage at the commemoration of the second anniversary of “Dear Leader” Kim Jong-il’s death – the first major ceremony following the purge and execution of Jang Song-thaek, the former vice chairman of the National Defense Commission. Choe’s speech, with its threats against the United States and South Korea, seemed to set the stage for his political elevation. Jang Song-thaek had been seen as a kind of regent to Kim Jong-un, the young successor to the Kim family dynasty, and was thought to be number two in the regime. But he owed his position to his wife, Kim Kyong-hui, the only sister of Kim Jong-il, Kim Jong-un’s deceased father. Jang’s tact, as well as his usefulness as an interlocutor with China, enabled him to keep his position, despite his long-term separation from his wife. But in North Korea, blood is paramount: everything, including ideology and the national interest, is subservient to the maintenance of the Kim dynasty. The “legacy” of the “Great Leader” Kim Il-sung and his son, “Dear Leader” Kim Jong-il, determines all major decisions. I have long believed that the true holder of power since Kim Jong-il’s death has been his sister, Kim Kyong-hui, and no one else. North Korean culture would suggest that women do not take positions of leadership, but it appears that she was the only family member whom Kim Jong-il could trust. When he was incapacitated by illness, it was she who called the shots. Her blood tie to the Kim dynasty is the reason why, even after her husband was purged and executed (and the rest of his family rounded up), she maintained her political position. It has even been suggested that she made the decision to purge her husband. Though it cannot be known whether she also proposed killing him, it is not surprising that she believed that, with her own health failing, she could not leave the family dynasty to her husband’s care. Perhaps the most chilling aspect of Jang’s execution is that it appears to be part of a feeding frenzy that has claimed the lives of a number of senior officials and generals. And the bloodletting has been extremely personal: In August, Kim Jong-un reportedly ordered the execution by firing squad of an ex-girlfriend and other members of her musical ensemble; the killings are said to have been carried out in front of their families. Elsewhere in the communist world, such murderous purges were renounced long ago, first in the Soviet Union by Khrushchev, following his denunciation of Stalin, and then in China by Deng Xiaoping, following his rehabilitation and return to power in the late 1970’s. This “reform” did not make these regimes any more beneficent or efficient, but it did bring a degree of stability and predictability to their behavior. North Korea, always the least predictable of totalitarian communist states, remains in a twilight world. More disturbing is the question of whether China is going down a parallel path under President Xi Jinping. Ever since Deng’s rule, there has been an understanding that members of the Chinese Communist Party’s Politburo are not to be touched, even in retirement. But Xi, under the pretext of his anti-corruption battle, has targeted retired Politburo member Zhou Yongkang, who is now reportedly under house arrest, facing graft charges – and lurid allegations not only that he murdered his first wife but that he tried to assassinate Xi. China’s emphasis since Deng on rule by consensus may not have made the country any more democratic, but it at least prevented the re-emergence of a new cult of personality à la Mao Zedong. The question today is whether Xi’s flouting of this internal party convention is another step in re-creating one-man – and thus completely arbitrary – rule in China. In North Korea, of course, arbitrary rule – no matter how bizarre and inept – is always the norm. And now, with Jang purged, responsibility for economic failure in North Korea has been shifted to Choe. All officials and people related to him now live under the shadow of the executioner, for he is certain to bear the blame when the dynasty needs a scapegoat for its mounting problems. And Jang’s purge may make those problems worse. While China lost a convenient point of contact with the Kim regime, North Korea may have lost the only channel by which to sustain itself. The economy cannot be revived so long as international sanctions are maintained, and the sanctions seem certain to remain in place so long as the regime continues with its nuclear brinkmanship. China, which has been the Kim dynasty’s lifeline, no longer appears willing to offer it a blank check. So the day is fast approaching when Kim Jong-un and his clan will have to take responsibility for the country’s dire condition, and it may come soon after Kim Kyong-hui dies. If so, the Kim dynasty’s last chapter may have begun with the current spasm of executions, though the ending – for the Korean Peninsula and East Asia alike – remains very much in doubt.",
            "平壤清洗 东京—在冷战期间 ， “ 克里姆林学 ” （ Kremlinology）一词用来描述对苏联制高点内部所发生的事情的研究 — — 事实上，这需要穿透整个“铁幕 ” （ Iron Curtain ） 。 克里姆林学家（无所不用其极地）监控苏联核心领导层的人事升降境况。 谁签署了一份官方文件，谁在阅兵时站在红场列宁墓上方，这些东西的微言大义都会被深入解读。 所有这些与解密朝鲜政权比起来都是小儿科。 朝鲜政坛的真相远比苏联更加波诡云谲。 以12月17日发生的事件为例。 朝鲜劳动党中央军事委员会副主席崔龙海在“敬爱的领袖”金正日逝世两周年的纪念仪式上站在了显要位置。 该仪式也是前朝鲜国防委员会副主席张成泽被处决后的首次重大仪式。 崔龙海的演讲，以及他对美国和韩国的威胁，似乎在宣告他政治地位的抬升。 张成泽被视为金氏王朝年轻继承人金正恩的摄政王，朝鲜政权的二号人物。 但他的地位是由其妻、金正恩之父金正日唯一的妹妹金敬姬带来的。 张成泽老谋深算，并且在与中国的交往中作用显著，这让他得以保持自己的地位，尽管他与金敬姬早已分居。 但是，在朝鲜，血缘关系才压倒一切：包括意识形态和国家利益在内的所有东西都没有维持金氏王朝重要。 “伟大领袖”金日成和“敬爱的领袖”金正日的“遗志”决定了所有重要决策。 长期以来，我一直认为金正恩死后的真正掌权者没有其他人，只有他的妹妹金敬姬一人。 朝鲜文化决定了女性不能占据领袖位置，但金敬姬似乎是金正日能够信任的唯一家人。 金正日因病丧失行动能力时，是金敬姬招来了枪手。 血缘关系决定了即便丈夫遭到清洗和处决（其家人也遭到禁锢 ） ， 金敬姬仍能保持政治地位。 甚至有消息说是她决定清洗丈夫。 尽管无法得知她是否还建议除掉张成泽，但健康状况日益恶化的她认为不能让金氏王朝落入其夫之手并不令人奇怪。 或许处决张成泽最令人惊悚之处是这是让众多高官和将军丧命的大清洗的一部分。 这场流血完全是个人主义的：据报道，8月份金正恩下令枪决他的一位前女友和她的乐队；据说处决是当着他们家人的面进行的。 在其他共产主义国家，如此大清洗也早已是遥远的回忆了。 首先是苏联的赫鲁晓夫在批判斯大林进行过清洗，随后，邓小平在20世纪70年代末回到权力中心后写进行了清洗。 这一“改革”并未让这些政权更仁慈、更有效率，但确实给政权行为带来了一定程度和稳定性和可预测性。 而朝鲜依然是哪个隐密王朝，是所有集权主义国家中最难预测的那个。 最令人不安的问题是中国是否会在习近平治下也走上这条路。 自邓小平执政以来，一条不成文的规矩是中共政治局常委不能动，即使是退休常委也是如此。 但习近平以反腐斗争为托辞将目标指向了退休政治局常委周永康。 据报道，目前周永康已被软禁，并将面临贪污指控 — — 甚至谋杀发妻甚至试图刺杀习近平这样骇人听闻的罪行。 自邓小平以来，中国就强调根据共识治国，这或许并没有让中国变得更加民主，但至少防止了毛泽东式个人崇拜的卷土重来。 现在的问题是，习近平打破党内常规的做法是否是在中国重建独夫治国 — — 从而实现彻底独裁的又一步骤。 当然，在朝鲜，独裁统治 — — 不管多么奇怪和拙劣 — — 永远是常规。 现如今，随着张成泽的垮台，朝鲜经济失败的责任落在了崔龙海身上。 与崔龙海有关的官员和人物无不生活在刽子手的阴影下，当金氏王朝需要给日益深重的问题寻找替罪羊时，崔龙海毫无疑问将是不二之选。 张成泽的清洗让这些问题更加糟糕了。 中国失去了与金氏政权联系的方便点，但朝鲜失去的可能是维持生命的仅有渠道。 如果国际制裁维持下去，朝鲜经济就无法维持，而只要金氏政权继续其核边缘政策，国际制裁肯定会维持下去。 而作为金氏王朝生命线的中国也不再愿意向它提供空头支票了。 因此，金正恩及其集团马上就要为朝鲜的惨状付出代价了，这可能会在金敬姬死后不久发生。 果真如此的话，金氏王朝的终章的开始就是最近的一系列处决，尽管其结局 — — 对朝鲜半岛和东亚来说 — — 仍有诸多疑点。"

            "The New Neutrality TOKYO – Throughout the Cold War, the Soviet Union used every imaginable threat and inducement – including the ultimate prize of reunification – to bring about a neutral Germany. But German leaders of both the left and the right, from Konrad Adenauer to Willy Brandt, spurned every Soviet offer. Will authoritarian mercantilism now succeed where communism failed? Countries join alliances, or entities such as the European Union, because these groups make the benefits and obligations of membership as unambiguous as anything in international relations can be. For Germany and South Korea, however, relationships with historic allies – NATO and the United States, respectively – appear to be changing before our eyes. Through their huge purchases of goods, with promises of even more to come, today’s authoritarian/mercantilist regimes in Russia and China may be about to achieve by commerce what the Soviets could not achieve by bribery and threats. And the scale of that commerce is breathtaking, with German exports to China growing from $25.9 billion a decade ago to $87.6 billion in 2011, while South Korea’s exports have increased from $53 billion to $133 billion during the same period of time. A form of stealth neutralism, indeed, appears to be entering both countries’ diplomacy. Witness Chinese President Xi Jinping’s recent trip to South Korea, German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s unwillingness to impose effective sanctions on Russia for its intervention in Ukraine, and the business-only focus of her just-concluded visit to China. In both Germany and South Korea, the idea that historic alliances may offer fewer tangible benefits than tacit neutrality – particularly in terms of exports – appears to be taking root, especially among business elites. Xi’s visit to Seoul was another bold step in China’s systematic efforts to wean South Korea from its commitment to the US-led international economic order. By offering to permit South Korea to settle its bilateral trade accounts in renminbi, and to launch the first-ever Sino-South Korean initiative toward North Korea, Xi is seeking to convince South Korea’s leaders that the country’s future, including reunification, will be determined in Beijing. China’s invitation to South Korea to participate in a new Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (alongside other countries in Asia and the Arab world, but excluding Japan and India) furthers Xi’s efforts to create an alternative financial system, with the AIIB mimicking the Asia Development Bank’s work. China’s embrace of South Korea is part of a long-term strategy to turn it into a subordinate state in terms of foreign and national security policy (much as Finland kowtowed to the Soviet Union throughout the Cold War). And yet, though courted by all sides in the struggle to maintain stability in Northeast Asia, South Korea now runs the risk of becoming isolated. Every gesture by the South toward one of the protagonists – China, the US, Japan, and North Korea – elicits so much pressure by the others that its government must then somehow devise a compensatory policy. For example, following President Park Geun-hye’s request that Xi honor the Korean assassin of a Japanese prime minister, to which Xi readily agreed, she began to discuss joining the US-led Trans-Pacific Partnership free-trade negotiations, in order to assuage the US. As China continued to pursue an anti-Japanese propaganda campaign throughout 2013, Park felt obliged to make some effort to revive ties with Japan by sending a private envoy to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to seek talks on reconciling their disputes. Given its insecurity, a by-product of the Korean Peninsula’s long division, South Korea requires, above all, calm and steady partners. But frequent changes in US policy toward Northeast Asia in recent years have disoriented South Korean policymakers, while Chinese policy, though consistent, confronts South Korea’s leaders with choices that they appear unprepared to make. As a result, South Korea’s elite appears to be splitting into pro-Chinese and pro-American factions that transcend party lines. Over a period of time, the only beneficiaries are likely to be those who call for “Finlandization” of the Korean peninsula. Meanwhile, the impact on German foreign policy of the country’s deepening economic ties with Russia has been evident throughout the Ukraine crisis. Though Merkel frequently admonished the Kremlin about its intervention in Ukraine, German public opinion – particularly that of the country’s business leaders – tied her hands. Indeed, German big businesses have been the main obstacle to imposing the type of systemic sanctions that might have dissuaded Russian President Vladimir Putin from annexing Crimea and continuing to back the insurgency (which Russia itself incited) in eastern Ukraine. This is not the only recent case in which Germany has distanced itself from its allies and partners. In Libya in 2011, Germany refused to offer even rudimentary material support to the military intervention staged by its British and French allies. Germany has also continuously failed to meet its commitment to spend 2% of its GDP on defense, at the same time that it has insisted that troubled EU economies stick to austerity budgets that limit their deficits to a fixed proportion of their economic output. Indeed, throughout the eurozone crisis, Germany did the absolute minimum – and always at the last possible moment – to assist its EU partners. And German leaders’ obsession with maintaining their country’s “golden decade” of exports appears to have gagged them on topics like China’s human rights abuses and its aggressive behavior toward its Asian neighbors. That silence is being rewarded with the first-ever joint cabinet sessions between a democracy and a communist dictatorship, which will take place in Berlin this autumn. In both Germany and South Korea, economic strength seems to have produced an illusion of policy independence that is opening a chasm between the two countries and their allies – a chasm that revelations of US spying, on Merkel in particular, have deepened. Germany and South Korea, however, will gain little, and risk much, if they downgrade their alliance ties in favor of commercially motivated, if unofficial, neutrality. Whatever short-term benefits they receive will be more than offset by their strategic vulnerabilities vis-à-vis Russia and China.",
            "新中立 东京—在整个冷战期间，苏联用一切可以想象的手段 — — 包括重新统一这一终极诱惑 — — 威逼利诱中立的德国。 但不论是东德还是西德领导人，从阿登纳到勃兰特，都不为所动。 在共产主义已经失败的地方，今天的极权重商主义能成功吗？ 国家加入联盟或欧盟这样的实体，因为组成这样的集团能让成员获得明确的好处和义务，这是任何国际关系都无法与之媲美的。 但是，对德国和韩国来说，与其历史盟友 — — 分别是北约和美国 — — 的关系似乎正在我们眼皮底下发生改变。 今天的俄罗斯和中国极权/重商主义政权大量购买商品，并承诺在未来还会继续加码，大有以商业手段完成苏联靠贿赂和威胁无法完成的任务。 通商的规模令人咋舌，德国对华出口从十年前的259亿美元增长到2011年的876亿美元，而同期韩国出口从530亿美元增至1,330亿美元。 事实上，一种隐中立形式正在进入两国外交。 如国国家主席习近平最近的韩国之行、德国总理默克尔不愿就俄罗斯干预乌克兰对后者实施有效制裁以及她在最近的访华过程中只侧重商业。 在德国和韩国，历史盟友比沉默中立带来的有形好处更少（特别是用出口衡量 ） ， 这一思想已经站稳了脚跟，特别是在商业精英中间。 习近平对首尔的访问是中国系统性诱导韩国抛弃美国领导的国际经济秩序的新的重大举措。 习近平开出的条件包括允许韩国用人民币结算双边贸易账户以及开战史上首次中韩联合对朝行动，目的是让韩国领导人相信韩国的未来（包括重新统一）取决于北京。 中国邀请韩国参与新的亚洲基础设施投资银行（Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank，简称AIIB其他参与方包括亚洲和阿拉伯世界，但不包括日本和印度 ） ， 这是习近平建立替代金融体系的新步骤 — — AIIB功能与亚洲开发银行相仿。 中国拉拢韩国是其长期战略的一部分 — — 让韩国沦为外交和国家安全政策的附庸国（正如冷战期间芬兰对苏联的俯首帖耳 ） 。 但是，尽管在保持东北亚稳定的斗争中，韩国是各方争取的对象，但如今它却面临被孤立的危险。 只要韩国向相关国家 — — 中国、美国、日本和朝鲜 — — 做出姿态，都会引起其他国家的施压，迫使韩国政府随后做出补偿性政策。 比如，韩国总统朴槿惠要求习近平颂扬刺杀日本首相的韩国人（习近平早已准备好欣然接受 ） ， 随后又开始准备讨论加入美国领导的跨太平洋合作伙伴（Trans-Pacific Partnership）自由贸易谈判，以此讨好美国。 2013年，中国一直在进行反日宣传，与此同时，朴槿惠感到有必要采取行动修复与日本的关系，派遣个人特使与首相安倍晋三会晤，寻求谈判调和两国争端。 朝鲜半岛的长期分裂让韩国得不到安全，因此对韩国来说，最重要的莫过于时刻准备着的冷静伙伴。 但近几年来，美国东北亚政策变化频繁，这令韩国决策者无所适从；而中国政策尽管具有一致性，却让韩国领导人不得不面对尚未做好准备的选择。 结果，韩国精英在亲中和亲美之间分裂为两个跨越党派的阵营。 在相当长的一段时间里，唯一的受益者或许只有呼吁朝鲜半岛“芬兰化”的人。 与此同时，德国外交政策令该国经济与俄罗斯结成深刻关系的影响在乌克兰危机中尽显无疑。 尽管默克尔频繁劝诫克里姆林宫不要干预乌克兰，但德国公众观点 — — 特别是其商业领袖 — — 令默克尔大受掣肘。 事实上，德国大企业正是对俄罗斯实施系统性制裁的主要阻挠力量。 系统性制裁本或许可以让俄罗斯总统普京三思其吞并克里米亚并继续支持俄罗斯自身也牵涉其中的东乌克兰叛乱。 这并非最近得多与其盟友和伙伴拉开距离的唯一例子。 在2011年的利比亚事件中，德国甚至拒绝为其英国和法国盟友所实施的军事干预提供基本物质支持。 德国也一直没有满足其将GDP的2%用于防务的承诺，与此同时，德国坚持要求受困欧盟经济体采取将斥资限制在经济产出一定比例之内的紧缩性预算。 事实上，在整个欧元区危机中，德国在援助欧盟伙伴国方面付出的是绝对最小值 — — 并且总是在最后关头才付出。 德国李刚电脑人沉溺于保持德国出口的“黄金十年 ” ， 这令他们在中国侵犯人权以及冒犯亚洲邻国等问题上无从开口。 他们的缄默带来的好处是历史上首个民主国家与共产主义独裁政府间的联合内阁会议 — — 将于今年秋天在柏林举行。 在德国和韩国，经济优势似乎营造出一个政策独立的幻觉，而这一幻觉正在两国与其盟友之间形成裂痕 — — 并因为美国的间谍行为（特别是针对默克尔的行为）而深化。 但是，德国和韩国如果因为采取出于商业动机的中立（尽管不是正式中立）而弱化它们与盟友的关系的话，其风险将远大于利益。 不论它们收获什么短期利益，都无法弥补它们在俄罗斯和中国面前的战略弱势。"

            "Ending East Asia’s History Wars TOKYO – Georges Clemenceau, who, as France’s prime minister, led his country to victory in World War I, famously said that “war is too important to be left to the generals.” Japan is now discovering that history is too important to be left to newspaper editors. In the 1990s, the newspaper Asahi Shimbun caused a firestorm at home and in South Korea by publishing a series of articles, based upon testimony by the former Japanese soldier Seiji Yoshida, on “comfort women” – Koreans forced to provide sexual services to the Japanese Imperial Army during World War II. Asahi has now admitted that the soldier’s confessions were unfounded, and has disavowed the core supporting evidence for the articles. That retraction appears to be causing as much embarrassment – and diplomatic vitriol – in Japan and South Korea today as the original series did. But, at a time when both countries cannot afford to permit partisan or sloppy abuses of history to roil their bilateral relations, Asahi’s careless work has turned out to be more than abysmal journalism; it has introduced a dangerous element into regional diplomacy. Some say that Japan and South Korea should follow the example set by France and Germany. Reconciling in the first two decades following the Nazi Occupation of France, these countries’ leaders understood that their security and economic ties were far too important to their citizens’ wellbeing to allow the old hatreds to fester. They knew that the unimaginable violence of WWII was a direct result of the antagonisms that had festered since the Napoleonic Wars and that were allowed to persist after 1918. In Charles de Gaulle and Konrad Adenauer, France and Germany had two of the twentieth century’s greatest statesmen, leaders who were able to discern the broad sweep of history through the fog of quotidian politics. Their loyalty was not only to the citizens who elected them, but also to the generations of the past that had endured the consequences of Franco-German enmity, and to generations yet to come, which would benefit from reconciliation. Of course, given that Japan and Korea have not fought a series of wars against each other, their relationship is not the same as that between Germany and France. But it is clear that no one will benefit from a new round of heated historical debate. To avoid this, political leaders like de Gaulle and Adenauer are needed. Only when we can discuss the past without endangering the future will the countries of Northeast Asia be able to establish a truly durable structure of peace. As Admiral Dennis C. Blair, a former commander of the US Pacific Fleet, stated at a recent conference, “The history of Asia from the 1930s to about 1955 or so was not pretty in any way….I don’t think any country can have a monopoly on righteousness, or on guilt and shame” for that time. Blair added that “the attempt to hold a ‘we were right’ and ‘you were wrong’ sweepstakes is not going to help our children and grandchildren understand what happened there.” Japan and South Korea need to take responsibility for the future, not obsess about the past. A recent Japanese government white paper called South Korea the country “that shares the closest relationship with Japan historically and in areas such as economy and culture.” No doubt, many, if not most, South Korean foreign-policy experts and strategists share that sentiment. But it will take committed leadership to transcend the history wars and tap the full potential of Japanese-Korean cooperation, something that both countries’ key ally, the United States, strongly desires, as it seeks to draw China into a lasting and peaceful Asian order. For too long, intemperate historical debates – often driven by biased newspaper accounts – have poisoned bilateral relations. Now, as another war of words heats up, Japanese and South Korean leaders need to step back, recognize where the real interests of their people lie, both today and in the future, and calmly begin to take the measures required to ensure durable reconciliation.",
            "结束东亚的历史战争 东京—担任总理带领法国打赢第一次世界大战的克莱蒙梭有一句名言 ： “ 兵者事大，不可付诸将 。 ” 日本现在发现，史者事大，不可付诸新闻编辑。 20世纪90年代 ， 《 朝日新闻》发表了一系列基于前日军士兵吉田清治（Seiji Yoshida）回忆的关于“慰安妇”的文章。 二战期间，许多韩国妇女被迫为大日本帝国皇军提供性服务，被称为慰安妇。 《朝日新闻》现在承认，吉田清治的自白根本是子虚乌有，该系列文章的核心支持证据也是假的。 如此翻供引起了轩然大波，其在今天的日本和韩国的影响不亚于文章发表之时。 但是，如今两国都不能允许狭隘或草率的历史指责破坏双边关系 ， 《 朝日新闻》的鲁莽举动不仅是新闻业的污点；还给地区外交带来了危险元素。 有人说，日本和韩国应该效仿法国和德国的例子。 在纳粹占领法国后的第一个二十年里，两国领导人互相妥协，他们明白，对于公民福祉来说，安全和经济合作远比放任旧恨发酵更重要。 他们知道，二战的难以想象的暴力乃是对抗的直接后果，而对抗的源头是拿破仑战争，并且在1918年后放任其不断壮大。 法国和德国拥有可跻身二十世纪最伟大政治家行列的戴高乐和阿登纳，他们能够拨开琐碎政治的迷雾，认清历史大势。 他们不仅忠诚于选他们做领导人的公民，也忠诚于经受了法德仇恨后果的先人和将从妥协中获益的尚未来到世上的后代。 当然，日本和韩国（朝鲜）之间交战频仍，其关系不同于德法关系。 但显然，掀起新一轮激烈的历史争论不能让任何人受益。 为了避免这一点，日本和韩国需要戴高乐和阿登纳这样的政治领袖。 我们什么时候能够平和地讨论过去、不给未来造成威胁，东北亚各国才能构建真正的持久和平框架。 前美国太平洋舰队司令布莱尔上将（Dennis C. Blair）在最近的会议上指出 ， “ 20世纪30年代到1955年左右的亚洲历史绝对算不上光彩 ， … …我认为没有一个国家占据着全部的正确性，也没有一个国家需要承担所有罪恶和羞耻 。 ” 布莱尔还说 ， “ 一定要争出个对错对于让我们的子孙理解当时发生过什么毫无帮助 。 ” 日本和韩国需要为未来负责，而不能被过去羁绊。 最新的日本政府白皮书称韩国“与日本有着最为紧密的历史关系和经济和文化等领域的联系 。 ” 毫无疑问，许多（甚至绝大部分）韩国外交政策专家和战略家都同意这一论断。 但只有有决心的领导层才能超越历史战争，充分激发日韩合作潜力，两国的关键盟友美国强烈支持日韩合作，以便让中国也加入持续的和平亚洲秩序。 历史争论 — — 往往受有偏见的报纸文章煽动 — — 毒害双边关系已有很长的时间。 如今，又一场口水仗眼看着就要打响，日本和韩国灵动人应该后退一步，认清今天和未来人民的真正利益在哪里，冷静地开始采取必要措施确保持久妥协。"

            "Taming the China Bears BEIJING – The market is always in search of a story, and investors, it seems, think they have found a new one this year in China. The country’s growth slowdown and mounting financial risks have spurred a growing wave of pessimism, with economists worldwide warning of an impending crash. But dire predictions for China have abounded for the last 30 years, and not one has materialized. Are today’s really so different? The short answer is no. Like the predictions of the past, today’s warnings are based on historical precedents and universal indicators against which China, with its unique economic features, simply cannot be judged accurately. The bottom line is that the complexity and distinctiveness of China’s economy mean that assessing its current state and performance requires a detail-oriented analysis that accounts for as many offsetting factors as possible. Predictions are largely pointless, given that the assumptions underpinning them will invariably change. Consider China’s high leverage ratio, which many argue will be a key factor in causing a crisis. After all, they contend, developing countries that have experienced a large-scale credit boom have all ended up facing a credit crisis and a hard economic landing. But several specific factors must be accounted for in assessing whether this is China’s fate. While China’s debt/GDP ratio is very high, the same is true in many successful East Asian economies, such as Taiwan, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, and Malaysia. And China’s saving rate is much higher. Ceteris paribus, the higher the saving rate, the less likely it is that a high debt/GDP ratio will trigger a financial crisis. In fact, China’s high debt/GDP ratio is, to a large extent, a result of its simultaneously high saving and investment rates. And, while the inability to repay loans can contribute to a high debt burden, the nonperforming-loan (NPL) ratio for China’s major banks stands at less than 1%. If, based on these considerations, one concludes that China’s debt/GDP ratio does constitute a substantial threat to its financial stability, there remains the question of whether a crisis is likely to occur. Only when all of the specific linkages between a high debt burden and the onset of a financial crisis have been identified can one draw even a tentative conclusion about that. China’s real-estate price bubble is often named as a likely catalyst for a crisis. But how such a downturn would unfold is far from certain. Let us assume that the real-estate bubble has burst. In China, there are no subprime mortgages, and the down payment on the purchase price required to qualify for financing can exceed 50%. Given that property prices are unlikely to fall by such a large margin, the bubble’s collapse would not bring down China’s banks. Even if real-estate prices fell by more than 50%, commercial banks could survive – not least because mortgages account for only about 20% of banks’ total assets. At the same time, plummeting prices would attract new homebuyers in major cities, causing the market to stabilize. And China’s recently announced urbanization strategy should ensure that cities’ demographic structure supports intrinsic demand. If that were not enough to ward off disaster, the government could purchase unsold properties and use them for social housing. Moreover, if necessary, banks could recover funds by selling collateral. As a last resort, the government could step in, as it did in the late 1990’s and early 2000’s, to remove NPLs from banks’ balance sheets. Indeed, China has a massive war chest of foreign-exchange reserves that it would not hesitate to use to inject capital into commercial banks. That remains a highly unlikely scenario. China’s banking system does face risks stemming from a maturity mismatch between loans and deposits. But the mismatch is less severe than some observers believe. In fact, the average term of deposits in China’s banks is about nine months, while medium- and long-term loans account for just over half of total outstanding credit. A more salient threat would arise if the government pursued too much capital-account liberalization too fast. If China eases restrictions on cross-border capital flows, an unexpected shock could trigger large-scale capital flight, bringing down the entire financial system. Given this, it is vital that China maintains controls over short-term cross-border capital flows in the foreseeable future. Likewise, the Chinese government must address a fundamental contradiction. Monetary interest rates have increased steadily, owing to rampant regulatory arbitrage (whereby banks find loopholes that enable them to avoid unfavorable rules) and the fragmentation of the credit market, while return on capital has fallen rapidly because of overcapacity. If the Chinese government fails to reverse this trend, a financial crisis – in one form or another – will become inevitable. But, given the authorities’ broad scope for policy intervention, the crash will not come anytime soon – if it comes at all.",
            "驳中国崩溃论 北京—市场总是在寻找故事，而投资者似乎认为今年在中国找到了一个新故事。 中国增长减速和金融风险积累让越来越多的人感到悲观，全球经济学家警告可能马上发生崩溃。 但对中国的悲观预测在过去30年来早已见怪不怪，没有一个成为现实。 今天的预测真的会不同吗？ 简单的答案是否定的。 和过去的预测一样，今天的警告基于不利于中国的历史先例和普通指标，而中国的经济特征是独一无二的，因此这样的预测不可能准确。 说到底，中国经济的复杂性和特殊性意味着评估当前状况和表现需要以细节为导向的分析，尽可能多地考虑抵消性因素。 预测大部分毫无意义，因为基本假设总是在变化。 以中国的高杠杆率为例，许多人认为，这将成为引发危机的重大因素。 他们指出，毕竟曾经经历过大规模信用繁荣的发展中国家最终都出现了信用危机和经济硬着陆。 但在评估中国是否会蹈此覆辙时，必须考虑一些具体因素。 中国债务/GDP之比固然很高，但其他许多成功的东亚经济体也是如此，比如中国台湾、新加坡、韩国、泰国和马来西亚。 并且中国的储蓄率要高得多。 给定其他条件不变，储蓄率越高，高债务/GDP比触发金融危机的可能性越小。 事实上，中国的高债务/GDP比在很大程度上是储蓄率和投资率同时高企的结果。 此外，尽管无法偿还贷款让债务负担加重，但中国主要银行的不良贷款率仍低于1 % 。 基于这些考虑，如果你认为中国的债务/GDP比确实构成了金融稳定的巨大威胁，那么还有一个问题：危机是否可能发生。 只有所有高债务负担和金融危机爆发之间的具体联系都存在，你才可以做出假设性的论断。 中国的房地产泡沫经常被认为是危机的一大可能催化因素。 但危机会如何展开谁也说不清。 不妨假设房地产泡沫已经破裂。 中国不存在次贷，要获得按揭，首付比例可能超过50 % 。 给定房地产价格难以出现如此大幅的下跌，则泡沫的破裂拖不垮中资银行。 即使房地产价格下跌超过50 % ， 商业银行也可以存活下来 — — 次贷仅占银行总资产的20%左右。 与此同时，价格剧降会吸引大城市的新买家，让市场企稳。 中国最近宣布的城市化战略应能确保城市人口结构支持内在需求。 如果这还不足以防止灾难，那么政府还可以收购未出售住房用于社会保障房。 此外，如有必要，银行可以拍卖抵押品回收资金。 最后，政府也可以介入，如20世纪90年代末、21世纪初那样将不良贷款从银行帐上剥离。 事实上，中国有巨大的外汇储备，向商业银行注入资本根本不需要犹豫。 这样的情景可能性很低。 中国银行系统确实面临存贷款期限不匹配问题所产生的风险。 但这一不匹配的程度比一些观察者认为的轻。 事实上，中资银行平均存款期限是九个月左右，中长期贷款只是刚刚超出总未偿还信用的一半。 如果政府的资本账户自由化步子迈得太大太快，就会产生更大的风险。 如果中国放松跨境资本流限制，那么意外冲击就可能引发大规模资本外逃，拖垮整个金融体系。 因此，中国，在可预见的未来，中国应该保持对短期跨净资本流的管制。 类似地，中国政府必须纠正一个基本矛盾。 由于监管套利肆虐（银行借此寻找漏洞规避不利规则）和信用市场分裂，货币利率稳步上升，与此同时，产能过剩却让资本回报快速下降。 如果中国政府不能扭转这一趋势，金融危机 — — 不管以何种形式 — — 就将难以避免。 但是，考虑到当局有很大的政策干预余地，即使不能完全排除崩溃的可能，短期也不太可能发生崩溃。"

            "The Long March from the Third Plenum BEIJING – Though China’s leadership succession was completed earlier this year, the policy agenda for the coming decade has only just been revealed. Following Chinese political tradition, the country’s new leadership had to wait for the Third Plenum of the Chinese Communist Party’s 18th Central Committee – held 3-4 quarters after the First Plenum, where the succession was sealed – to unveil its economic-policy priorities. Third Plenums – and perhaps only Third Plenums – can bring about radical transformation. Indeed, it was at the Third Plenum of the CCP’s 11th Central Committee that Deng Xiaoping launched the reforms that opened up the Chinese economy and triggered more than three decades of rapid economic growth. The Third Plenums of the CCP’s 14th and 16th Central Committees – held in 1993 and 2003, respectively – also stand out. At both meetings, CCP leaders put forward comprehensive plans for the creation and perfection of the so-called “socialist market economy” in China. The 60-point “resolution” produced at the most recent Third Plenum covers six areas: the economy, the political system, the environment, culture, society, and Party capacity-building. This represents a significant departure from the agendas produced at previous Third Plenums, which focused exclusively on economic reform. But, when it comes to economic-reform objectives, the resolution is not overwhelmingly innovative. Indeed, most of the goals that it includes – like reform of state-owned enterprises (SOEs), development of private enterprise, reduction of government intervention, protection of property rights, and creation of a modern market system – can be found in the resolution of the Third Plenum of the CCP’s 16th Central Committee. Even the decision to redefine the market’s role in resource allocation as “decisive” was not the breakthrough that many observers have claimed. After all, the 2003 resolution had already defined the market as “fundamental” to resource allocation. Given this, the latest resolution’s most important implication is that it has dispelled any doubt about the new leadership’s commitment to the market-oriented reform that Deng initiated in 1978. In line with tradition, the Third Plenum’s resolution did not discuss problems concerning growth and development, which one hopes the government will address in greater detail in the near future. That said, some of the resolution’s specific provisions for economic reform represent much-needed progress. · SOEs will be required to deliver 30% of their profits to the state, instead of keeping most – or even all – of their profits, as they have done for the last two decades. · Farmers will be granted more property rights, allowing them, for example, to transfer and mortgage land-use rights, though the government understandably continues to exercise caution about rural-land privatization. · A real-estate property tax will be introduced, in order to suppress skyrocketing housing prices and reduce the vacancy rate – a controversial but perhaps necessary move. · The one-child policy will be eased, allowing a couple to have two children if one parent is an only child. (Whether this change will be enough to reverse problematic demographic trends remains a topic of heated debate.) · The government will “accelerate the reform of the household registration system,” in an effort to facilitate urbanization. But emphasis seems to have shifted to encourage coordinated development between urban and rural areas. While rural migrant workers will be encouraged to settle in small and medium-size cities, migration to metropolises will remain tightly controlled – or even be more strictly regulated. But the resolution’s genuinely groundbreaking objectives lie in other areas. For starters, the resolution includes two potentially game-changing legal reforms. First, it emphasizes the government’s commitment to “respect and protect human rights,” prohibiting law-enforcement authorities from extracting confessions “by torture, corporal punishment, or abuse” and abolishing widely criticized programs for “re-education through the labor system.” Second, in order to strengthen judicial independence, the resolution includes a call “to explore the establishment of judicial jurisdiction systems that are suitably separated from administrative areas.” In other words, the courts should be able to make decisions independently of the local governments that finance them. In the political realm, the resolution includes measures to strengthen China’s so-called “consultative democracy.” While the concept of enhancing the role of non-CCP forces in Chinese politics is not new, its prominence in the resolution reflects the Party’s willingness to adopt a more democratic political system – as long as it retains its dominant position, of course. In a one-party system, meritocracy is a prerequisite for good governance, which in turn plays a central role in maintaining social stability. Unfortunately, meritocracy has been eroded by a political culture of sycophancy and cynicism. Designing a screening mechanism to minimize adverse selection in choosing bureaucrats and party officials has become one of the biggest challenges that China’s ruling elites confront. Although the resolution’s general message is encouraging, a shopping list of reform objectives is not a strategic analysis of the contradictions that are undermining China’s development, let alone an action plan for responding to these contradictions. Indeed, for China’s new leadership, the successful completion of the Third Plenum is only the first step in a new long march toward a more stable, prosperous future.",
            "三中全会，长征的起点 北京—尽管中国领导层交接已在今年早些时候完成，但未来十年的政策日程才刚刚揭开。 根据中国政治传统，新领导层必须等到中共十八届三中全会 — — 大约要在交接尘埃落定后3—4个季度召开 — — 才能公布其经济政策顺序。 三中全会 — — 可能也只有三中全会 — — 能够带来彻底的改变。 事实上，邓小平正是在中共十一届三中全会上拉开了改革开放的序幕，开启了三十年的快速经济增长时期。 中共十四届和十六届三中全会（分别于1993年和2003年召开）也相当突出。 在这两次会议上，中共领导人推出了建立和完善“社会主义市场经济”的全面计划。 最近的十八届三中全会所公布的60点《决定》覆盖了六大领域：经济、政治制度、环境、文化、社会和党的能力建设。 这与焦点全部集中在经济改革的前几次三中全会大不相同。 但是，对于经济改革目标，十八届三中全会的《决定》算不上十足的创新。 事实上 ， 《 决定》所包括的大部分目标 — — 如国有企业改革、民营企业发展、减少政府干预、保护产权和建立现代市场制度 — — 都可以在中共十六届三中全会《决定》中找到。 即使是重新定义市场在资源配置中起“决定性”作用的决定，也不像许多观察者所说的那样算得上突破。 毕竟，2003年的《决定》便已定义市场在资源配置中起“基础性”作用。 基于此，最新的《决定》的最大影响在于打消了任何关于新领导层是否会遵循邓小平在1978年开始实施的市场改革的疑虑。 根据传统，此次三中全会《决定》没有讨论关于增长和发展的问题，而人们希望政府尽快给出这方面问题的详细方案。 尽管如此 ， 《 决定》的一些具体经济改革措施直指急需的方向。 · 国有企业将被要求把30%的利润上缴国家，而不是像在过去二十年中那样留存大部分甚至所有利润。 · 农民将获得更多的产权，允许转移和抵押土地使用权，尽管不难理解，政府对于农地私有化仍十分谨慎。 · 将实施房地产税，以抑制高企的房价和降低空置率 — — 这一措施会引起争议，但可能必须实施。 · 独生子女政策将放松，允许一方为独生子女的夫妻生育二孩。 （这一改变是否足以扭转不利的人口趋势仍是个争论激烈的话题。 ） · 政府将“加快户籍制度改革 ” ， 以促进城镇化。 但重点似乎转移到了鼓励城镇和农村地区的协调发展上。 尽管农民工将被鼓励在中小城市定居，但向大城市的转移仍将被高度控制 — — 甚至管理更加严格了。 但《决定》真正的突破性目标在其他领域。 首先 ， 《 决定》包含了两项具有改变局面效果的法律改革。 一是《决定》强调政府要“尊重和保护人权 ” ， 禁止执法当局“刑讯逼供，体罚虐待 ” ， 并废除了饱受批评的“劳动教养”制度。 第二，为了加强司法独立性 ， 《 决定》要求“探索建立与行政区划适当分��的司法管辖制度 ” 。 换句话说，法院应该能够独立于向它们提供资金的地方政府做出决定。 在政治领域 ， 《 决定》中包括了强化中国所谓的“协商民主”的措施。 尽管加强非共产党人士在中国政治中的作用并非新的概念，但期在《决定》中的显赫地位反映出中共准备采取更加民主的政治制度 — — 当然，只要它能继续保持主宰地位。 在一党制度下，精英治国是好治理的前提，而好治理又是维持社会稳定的关键。 不幸的是，精英治国受到了谄媚和犬儒政治文化的侵蚀。 设计监督机制以实现党政官员选拔中的逆向选择的最小化已成为中国执政精英所面临的最大挑战之一。 尽管《决定》的基本信息令人振奋，但改革目标清单算不上对破坏中国发展的矛盾的战略分析，更不用说应对这些矛盾的行动计划了。 事实上，对中国的新领导层来说，成功完成三中全会只是通往更稳定繁荣的未来的长征的第一步。"

            "China’s Trilemma BEIJING – The Nobel laureate economist Robert Mundell showed that an economy can maintain two – but only two – of three key features: monetary-policy independence, a fixed exchange rate, and free cross-border capital flows. But China is currently juggling all three – an act that is becoming increasingly difficult to sustain. At first glance, this may not seem to be the case. Given that the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) has largely maintained its monetary-policy independence over the last three decades, and actively manages the renminbi’s exchange rate, it is natural to conclude that China imposes strict controls on capital flows. In fact, China liberalized inward foreign direct investment more than 20 years ago, and eased controls for much of the capital account thereafter. China’s efforts to regulate cross-border capital flows have never been very effective. During the Asian financial crisis of the 1990s, China had to implement draconian measures to prevent capital flight. In the early 2000s, short-term capital began to flow into China, with investors betting on the renminbi’s appreciation and, from 2004-2006, on rising asset prices. Since renminbi internationalization was launched in 2009, exchange-rate arbitrage and the carry trade have surged. Certainly, China’s capital controls, though porous, increase the transaction costs of moving short-term capital to and from China, thereby reducing upward pressure on the renminbi’s exchange rate; in extreme circumstances, this could play a decisive role in China’s financial security. But capital continues to flow – if not entirely freely – across China’s borders. This raises an obvious question: How has China managed to defy the Mundell trilemma by maintaining all three policy objectives simultaneously? The answer lies in China’s sterilization policy. China has run a capital-account surplus for most of the last 30 years, and a trade surplus every year since 1993. The PBOC keeps the exchange rate stable by intervening heavily in the foreign-exchange market, creating so much liquidity that the authorities must engage in massive sterilization to avoid overshooting the targeted increase in the monetary base. In China, unlike in advanced countries, monetary and sterilization policy are often one in the same. The degree to which monetary policy is expansionary depends on the degree to which the liquidity created by currency-market intervention has been sterilized. The most frequently used monetary instrument in sterilization is open-market operations. Given China’s twin surpluses, the PBOC sold all of the government bonds that it had accumulated in 2003, so it has been selling central-bank bills ever since, with CN¥5 trillion ($812 billion) in such bills currently held by banks. Another important instrument for sterilization is the reserve-requirement ratio, which, when raised, locks a large amount of liquidity in the banking system. The ratio, which the PBOC has changed 42 times since 1998, currently stands at 20% – double the ratio for large banks in the United States. Whatever the mechanism, the costs of sterilization are very high. For starters, by maintaining an undervalued real exchange rate, China has fallen into the so-called “dollar trap,” boosting the US dollar’s international importance at China’s own expense. As time passes, the senselessness of this policy will become increasingly apparent. Sterilization also leads to a serious misallocation of resources, most obviously by functioning as a subsidy to the export sector, at the expense of the rest of the economy. A less noticed form of resource misallocation stems from the fact that only sellers of foreign exchange gain liquidity, but the whole economy feels the effects. As a result, small and medium-size enterprises that produce non-tradable products are denied much-needed funds and suffer from sterilization’s negative externalities. Furthermore, the high reserve ratio and forced purchase of central-bank bills squeezes commercial banks’ profits severely – a phenomenon that will be intensified by interest-rate liberalization. The quest for yield on available funds will drive banks to make riskier investments. There are also quasi-fiscal costs involved. Fortunately, despite the low returns on foreign assets, this is not yet a major problem for China, owing to the low costs of the corresponding PBOC liabilities. Nonetheless, though predictions that China would abandon its exchange-rate controls in order to uphold monetary autonomy have proved wrong over the last decade, this time may be different. With China’s liberalization of interest rates and short-term capital flows making it increasingly difficult for the country to juggle Mundell’s “irreconcilable trinity,” one hopes that Chinese leaders will finally allow the renminbi to float, while keeping in place existing capital controls.",
            "中国的三角困境 发自北京 — — 诺贝尔经济学奖得主罗伯特·蒙代尔指出一个经济体能且只能维持三个关键特性（货币政策独立性，固定汇率和跨境自由流动）中的两个。 而中国当前正奋力同时实现这三者 — — 但这种做法越来越难以掌控。 粗看之下，这种说法似乎不太正确。 考虑到中国人民银行在过去三十年间绝大多数时间都能维持其货币政策独立性，并对人民币的汇率实施积极管理，人们也会自然而然地推断中国队资本流动给予了严格管制。 但事实上，中国早在20多年前已经放开了面向本国的外国直接投资，自那以后也已对大部分资本账户松了绑。 中国试图控制跨境资本流动的努力从来都收效甚微。 在1990年代的亚洲金融危机期间，中国只得采取极为严苛的手段防止资本外流。 在本世纪初那几年，投资者们赌人民币升值，在2004~2006年间又押注资产价格升值，导致短期资本开始流入中国。 自从人民币国际化在2009年启动之后，汇率投机和套利交易也因此大幅增加。 当然，虽然中国的资本管制漏洞百出，但也增加了短期资本进出中国的交易成本，因此也减少了人民币汇率的上行压力；在极端情况下，这甚至可以在中国的金融安全方面扮演重要角色。 但资本依然继续在不断穿越（若非完全自由的话）中国国境。 因此就产生了一个显而易见的问题：中国是如何通过同时维持三大政策目标来逆转蒙代尔三重困境的？ 而答案就在中国的货币冲销政策之中。 中国在过去30年间绝大多数时候都拥有资本帐户顺差，并自1993年以来一直保持着贸易顺差。 中国人民银行大力干预外汇市场以维持汇率稳定，并以此创造了巨额流动性，迫使当局采取大规模冲销措施以避免增量超出货币基础的设定目标。 跟发达国家不同的是，中国的货币与冲销政策经常都是同一套做法。 货币政策扩张的程度取决于有多少货币市场干预下产生的流动性是被冲销掉了。 而冲销中使用最频繁的货币工具则是公开市场操作。 考虑到中国的双顺差状况，人民银行在2003年全部出售了之前积累下来的政府债券，随后则开始出售中央银行票据，估计有价值5万亿元人民币（折合8120亿美元）的这类票据被银行所持有。 另一个重要的冲销工具则是存款准备金率，提升该比率就能锁定银行系统中的一大笔流动性。 在人民银行自1998年以来修改了42次之后，该比率目前维持在20 % — —比美国大型银行高一倍。 不管使用何种机制，冲销的成本都极为高昂。 首先，为了维持一个低估的实际利率，中国陷入了一个所谓的“美元陷阱 ” ， 以牺牲自身为代价提升了美元的国际地位。 随着时间推移，这一政策的不合理性也日益凸显。 冲销政策也导致了资源的严重错配，最明显的就是其异化成为对出口部门的补贴，却让其他经济部门因此受害。 资源错配的另一个不明显形式则源自于只有外汇的卖出者们得到了流动性，但整体经济都感受到了影响。 结果生产非贸易类产品的中小型企业无法得到急需的资金并受到了冲销政策负面外部性的冲击。 此外，高存款贮备金率和强制购买央行票据严重积压了商业银行的利润空间 — — 该情况在利率管制放松之后还将进一步恶化。 为了在已有的资金水平下追求更高利润，各大银行职能涉足更高风险的投资。 这还另外牵涉到准财政成本。 幸运的是，尽管国外资产的回报较低，但由于对应的中国人民银行借贷成本也不高，所以对中国来说还不算是个重大问题。 即便如此，虽然中国将放弃其汇率管制以提升货币自主性的预测在过去十年内都被证伪，但这此情况可能有所不同。 随着中国放宽利率和短期资本流动，该国也日渐难以反抗蒙代尔的“无可调和三角定律 ” ， 希望中国领导人最终能在维持现有资本管制的情况下，允许人民币自由浮动。"

            "Reviving China’s Rebalancing BEIJING – China is at a crossroads. After experiencing three decades of unprecedentedly rapid GDP growth, the country weathered the global economic crisis exceptionally well. But it sustains considerable economic imbalances, which are undermining its ability to achieve high-income status. The question is whether China’s leaders – preoccupied with challenges like financial instability stemming from risky shadow-banking activities and a heavy burden of local-government debt – have the policy space to put the economy on a sounder footing. In the aftermath of the global economic crisis, China appeared to be on track to complete such a rebalancing. Its current-account surplus fell from more than 10% of GDP in 2007 to 2.6% in 2012, and it ran a large capital-account deficit for the first time since 1998. Moreover, China added only $98.7 billion to its foreign-exchange reserves in 2012, compared to an average annual increase of more than $435 billion from 2007 to 2011. That meant diminishing upward pressure on the renminbi’s exchange rate. But, over the last year, China’s imbalances returned with a vengeance. Its 2013 trade surplus likely exceeded $250 billion; its capital-account surplus exceeded $200 billion in the first three quarters of the year; and its foreign-exchange reserves soared by $509.7 billion. Meanwhile, the lower current-account surplus (as a share of GDP) could be a result of its increased investment-income deficit. And, while recovery in the advanced economies boosted exports, persistent overcapacity, combined with slower household-consumption growth than in 2012, caused investment growth, though still rapid, to decline to its lowest rate in the past 11 years. In principle, a country can run a current-account deficit or surplus continuously for decades. But China’s chronic surpluses are problematic. Given that China remains among the world’s poorest countries, with per capita income amounting to less than $7,000, its position as the world’s largest exporter of capital signifies a gross misallocation of resources. In fact, after running twin current- and capital-account surpluses persistently for two decades, China’s foreign-exchange reserves are poised to break the $4 trillion threshold, with the marginal cost of every dollar accrued vastly surpassing its potential benefits. In this context, the continued accumulation of foreign-exchange reserves is clearly counterproductive. Of course, rebalancing China’s economy will take time, and it will entail some risks and sacrifices. But China’s leaders must recognize that the country faces massive welfare losses, and thus should be willing to accept slower growth in the short term in exchange for a more stable long-term growth path. In fact, with a well-designed policy package, the duration and impact of the growth slowdown could be minimized. A critical first step is for the People’s Bank of China to stop intervening in the foreign-exchange market, which would halt the growth of the country’s foreign-exchange reserves. In other words, China should adopt a floating exchange-rate regime as soon as possible. Although this transition would have a negative impact on China’s economic growth, it would not be nearly as dire as many seem to believe. For starters, while it would likely cause the renminbi to strengthen, the consensus in China is that the current exchange rate is not far from the equilibrium level, meaning that the appreciation would likely be moderate. Likewise, although renminbi appreciation would diminish export growth, the slowdown would probably not be dramatic, given that China’s export sector is dominated by the processing trade (specifically, the assembly of intermediate inputs imported from countries like Japan and South Korea). And the accompanying increase in imports is unlikely to damage China’s economic growth significantly; it is more likely to complement, rather than substitute for, domestic demand. In short, China can afford the costs of rebalancing. Given that the liquidity flowing into China over the last several years was increasingly short-term capital aimed at exchange-rate and interest-rate arbitrage (so-called “hot money”), there may be a surge in capital outflows when appreciation expectations have disappeared. To prevent large-scale capital flight from threatening China’s financial stability, cross-border flows must be managed carefully. A flexible exchange rate dictated by market forces would eliminate the opportunities for currency speculators to make one-way bets on renminbi appreciation, thereby diminishing the stock of hot money that currently accounts for the bulk of China’s capital-account surplus. Even if China’s current account remained in surplus for some time, the shift from twin surpluses to a more normal external position would boost the efficiency of resource allocation considerably. For too long, China has delayed the necessary adjustment of its balance-of-payments structure. It is time to make a change, even if it requires bracing for some risks.",
            "重振中国再平衡 北京—中国正站在十字路口. 在经历了三十年的前所未有的快速GDP增长后，中国又无与伦比地抵御了全球经济危机。 但它也维持了严重的经济失衡，并且威胁到了它实现步入高收入行列的能力。 问题在于，面临来自高风险影子银行活动和沉重的地方政府债务负担的金融动荡的挑战，中国领导人是否有政策空间让经济走上更可靠的轨道。 全球经济危机爆发后，中国似乎走上了完成这一再平衡的轨道。 其经常项目盈余从2007年占GDP的10%下降到2012年的2.6 % ， 并且自1998年以来第一次出现了大规模资本账户赤字。 此外，2012年中国外汇储备只增加了987亿美元，而在2007—2011年间平均每年都要增长4350亿美元以上。 这意味着人民币汇率升值压力将减小。 但是，去年中国的失衡又卷土重来。 2013年贸易盈余可能突破2500亿美元；其资本账户盈余在前三季度突破了2000亿美元；其外汇储备激增5097亿美元。 与此同时，经常项目盈余的下降（以占GDP比重衡量）可能是因为投资-收入赤字增加的结果。 此外，尽管发达经济体的复苏提振了出口，但持续的产能过剩加上家庭消费增长较2012年放缓导致投资增长降到了过去11年以来的最低水平（尽管依然算得上强劲 ） 。 理论上，一国可以在几十年的时间里一直存在经常项目赤字或盈余。 但中国的长期盈余是有问题的。 由于中国仍是世界最穷的国家之一，人均收入只有不到7000美元，其作为世界最大资本出口国彰显出资源的严重错配。 事实上，在经历了二十年的经常项目和资本项目双盈余后，中国外汇储备将突破4万亿美元大关，其继续增加的每一美元所带来的边际成本都远远高于潜在收益。 在这样的条件下，继续积累外汇储备毫无疑问不利于生产。 当然，中国经济的再平衡需要时间，并且会带来一些风险和牺牲。 但中国领导人必须认识到，中国面连着大规模福利损失，因此需要拿出接受短期增长放缓以换取更稳定的长期增长路径的意愿。 事实上，只要政策设计合理，增长放缓的时间和影响是可以最小化的。 关键的第一步是中国人民银行要停止干预外汇市场，这将能阻止中国外汇储备的增加。 换句话说，中国应该尽快采取浮动汇率机制。 尽管这一转变会给中国经济增长带来消极影响，但并不会像许多人所担心的那样严重。 首先，虽然它可能造成人民币升值，但中国的共识是当前汇率与均衡水平相差不远，因而升值将是温和的。 类似地，尽管人民币升值会抑制出口增长，但减速可能不会很严重，因为中国的出口部门主要是加工贸易（具体地说，就是组装进口自日本和韩国等国家的中间产品 ） 。 而随之增加的进口也不可能对中国经济增长造成很大伤害；而更有可能起到补充而不是替代内需的作用。 简言之，中国承担得起再平衡的成本。 过去几年中流入中国的流动性是日益短期的旨在进行汇率和利率套利的资本（即所谓的“热钱 ” ） ，因此当升值预期消失时可能会出现资本大量外流。 为了防止大规模资本外逃威胁中国的金融稳定，跨境流必须谨慎地进行管理。 由市场力量决定的弹性汇率将扼杀货币投机者对人民币升值下单边注的机会，从而减少热钱存量。 目前热钱占据了中国资本账户盈余的大头。 即使中国经常项目在一段时间内还将保持盈余，从双盈余转向更加正常的外部处境能大幅改善资源配置的效率。 中国收支结构的必要调整已经拖得太久。 是时候做出改变了，即使这需要冒一些风险。"

            "China’s Investment Addiction BEIJING – China’s economy slowed unexpectedly in the second quarter of this year. Just as unexpectedly, most data released since July suggest that China’s growth has stabilized. Markets, not surprisingly, have breathed a collective sigh of relief. But should investors still be nervous? Currently, the most severe problem confronting Chinese authorities is overcapacity. For example, China’s annual production capacity for crude steel is one billion tons, but its total output in 2012 was 720 million tons – a capacity utilization rate of 72%. More strikingly, the steel industry’s profitability was just 0.04% in 2012. Indeed, the profit on two tons of steel was just about enough to buy a lollipop. So far this year, the average profitability of China’s top 500 companies is 4.34%, down 33 basis points from 2012. Some say that today’s overcapacity is a result of China’s past overinvestment. Others attribute it to a lack of effective demand. The government seems to come down in the middle. On one hand, the authorities have ordered thousands of companies to reduce capacity. On the other hand, the government has introduced some “mini-stimulus” measures, ranging from exemptions for “micro firms” from business and sales taxes to pressure on banks to increase loans to exporters. The authorities’ official line is that China’s growth model requires less investment and more consumption. But not all Chinese economists agree. They argue that capital stock is the key factor for growth, and that China’s per capita capital stock is still low relative to developed countries, which implies considerable scope for further investment. To be sure, capital accumulation is a driving force of economic growth, and catching up with developed-country income levels implies that China must increase its capital stock in the long run. But what is at issue is not the size of the capital stock, or even the level of investment; the problem is the growth rate of investment, which has been significantly higher than that of GDP for decades. According to official statistics, China’s investment rate is approaching 50% of GDP. Given absorption constraints, capital efficiency has been falling steadily amid increasing deadweight. If environmental damage caused by breakneck investment growth were taken into account, China’s capital efficiency would be even lower. Human capital and technological progress are as important to economic growth as physical capital and labor, if not more so. If resource allocation is skewed toward physical capital at the expense of accumulating human capital – for which adequate consumption is indispensable – economic growth would be more likely to slow than rise. So China should reduce the growth rate of investment and increase that of consumption, allowing the investment rate to settle at a more sustainable level. Of course, it is not entirely untrue that China’s overcapacity reflects a shortfall of effective demand. But where can effective demand come from? Again, China’s steel industry provides a telling example. Despite China’s lack of a comparative advantage for steel production, it has built approximately one thousand mills, with output accounting for roughly half of the global total. As early as 2004, China’s government tried to clamp down on overinvestment; and yet output increased dramatically, from 300 million tons that year to a billion tons in 2012, owing to strong demand generated by investment in infrastructure and real-estate development. China’s investment consists of mainly three broad categories: manufacturing industry, infrastructure, and real estate. In late 2008 and 2009, at the height of the global financial crisis, stimulus-fueled infrastructure investment sustained output growth. In 2010, investment in real-estate development replaced infrastructure investment as the main driver of growth. Today, both infrastructure and real estate are important drivers of China’s growth. China does need more infrastructure investment – particularly in power and water utilities, transport, and communications. But the pace of investment must take financial constraints fully into consideration. More important, China can and should invest more in social infrastructure such as schools, hospitals, retirement homes, and so on. However, real-estate investment is another story. It is difficult to judge how serious China’s property bubble is and when it might burst. But one thing is certain: China has invested too much in real-estate development. With per capita income at less than $6,000, homeownership in China is roughly 90%, compared to less than 70% in the United States. Average floor space per capita is 32.9 square meters, while median floor space per family in Hong Kong is just 48 square meters. China has 696 five-star hotels, with another 500 on the way. Five of the ten tallest skyscrapers under construction worldwide are in China. In my view, this is madness. China’s economy is being held hostage by real-estate investment. On one hand, China should not try to eliminate overcapacity by maintaining the high growth rate of real-estate investment. While investment in social housing should be welcomed, real-estate investment, currently running at 10-13% of GDP, is already far too high. On the other hand, if real-estate investment growth falls, overcapacity will be difficult to eliminate. This dilemma highlights the structural-adjustment challenge that China faces – and should give investors reason to hold their breath. That said, there are two caveats. First, unlike other categories of investment, real estate investment does not increase productive capital stock. There is no fundamental difference between a house and an expensive durable consumer good. Second, in China’s statistics, the growth rate of gross fixed-asset investment is much higher than that of gross capital formation. This indicates that data on the growth rate of fixed-asset investment may have exaggerated the pace of capital-stock accumulation. Hence, while the Chinese government should be firm on reducing the dependence of growth on investment, it must exercise utmost care when doing so.",
            "中国的投资依赖 北京—今年二季度，中国经济出人意料地放缓了。 同样出人意料的是，7月以来的大部分公布的大部分数据表明中国的增长已经稳定下来。 毫不奇怪，市场同时大舒一口气。 但投资者应该继续保持紧张吗？ 目前中国当局所面临的最严重的问题是产能过剩。 比如，中国粗钢年产能为十亿吨，但2012年总产量只有7.2亿吨 — — 产能利用率为72 % 。 更引人注目的是2012年钢铁业利润率只有0.04 % 。 事实上，生产量吨钢所获得的利润只能买一根棒棒糖。 今年截至目前中国前500家公司平均利润率为4.34 % ， 比2012年下降33个基点。 有人说今天的产能过剩来自过去的过度投资。 也有人认为产能过剩是因为有效需求不足。 政府的观点似乎是两者的折中。 一方面，当局要求数千家公司削减产能。 另一方面，政府引入了一些“迷你刺激”措施，比如“微型企业”免除营业税和销售税、要求银行增加出口企业贷款等。 当局的官方口径是中国的增长模式需要减少投资、增加消费。 但并非所有中国经济学家都同意这一点。 他们认为资本存量是增长的关键因素，而中国的人均资本存量相对发达国家仍然很低，这意味着未来投资空间很大。 诚然，资本积累是经济增长的一大动力，而赶超发达国家收入水平要求中国必须在长期增加资本存量。 但要紧的不是资本存量的规模，甚至也不是投资水平；要紧的是投资的增长率，几十年来这一数字大大高于GDP增长率。 根据官方统计数字，中国的投资率已接近GDP的50 % 。 拜吸收约束所赐，资本效率随着资本规模的增加而稳步下降。 如果把飞速增长的投资所造成的环境破坏考虑在内，中国的资本效率还会更低。 人力资本和技术进步对经济增长的作用不亚于实体资本和劳动。 如果资源配置向实体资本的倾斜以破坏人力资本积累为代价 — — 而后者又是充分消费的不可或缺的条件 — — 经济增长就更有可能放缓而不是加快。 因此，中国应该降低投资增长率，提高消费增长率，让投资率在更加可持续的水平上稳定下来。 当然，说中国的产能过剩反映的是有效需求的不足也不是完全错误的。 但有效需求来自何处？ 在这方面，中国钢铁业再次提供了很好的例子。 尽管中国在钢生产方面并无比较优势，但仍建设了大约一千家钢铁厂，产出占了全球总产量的半壁江山。 早在2004年，中国政府就试图降温过度投资；但由于基础设施投资和房地产开发所带来的强劲需求，产出仍然增长迅猛，从当年的3亿吨增加到2012年的10亿吨。 中国的投资大体可分为三块：制造业、基础设施和房地产业。 2008年底和2009年全球金融危机顶峰时，经济刺激带来的基础设施投资提升维持了产出增长。 2010年，房地产开发投资取代了基础设施投资成为增长的主要动力。 如今，基础设施和房地产都是中国增长的重要推动力。 中国确实需要更多的基础设施投资 — — 特别是在电力和水电、交通和通信方面。 但投资节奏必须充分考虑金融约束。 更重要的是，中国可以也应该更多地投资学校、医院、养老院等社会基础设施。 但房地产投资则是另一回事。 很难判断中国地产泡沫的严重程度以及破灭时间。 但有一点是肯定的：中国在房地产开发上已经投资得太多了。 中国的人均收入不到6000美元，但中国房屋自有率高达90%左右，而美国还不到70 % 。 人均住房面积为32.9平米，而香港中位家庭住房面积才刚刚达到48平米。 中国有696家五星级饭店，另有500家在建。 在建的十座最高建筑中有五座位于中国。 在我看来这只能用疯狂来形容。 中国经济正在被房地产投资绑架。 一方面，中国不应该通过保持房地产投资的高增长率来解决产能过剩。 社会住房项目投资值得欢迎，但目前占GDP高达10—13%的房地产投资已经显得太高。 另一方面，如果房地产投资增长回落，产能过生就无法消除。 这��两难凸显出中国所面临的结构性调整挑战 — — 也应该让投资者保持谨慎。 总而言之，有两点值得警惕。 首先，与其他投资类型不同，房地产投资并不增加生产性资本存量。 房子和高价耐久消费品之间并无根本不同。 其次，在中国的统计数据中，总固定资产投资增长率显著高于总资本形成增长率。 这表明固定投资的增长率数据可能夸大了资本存量积累的速度。 因此，尽管中国政府应该坚决地减少经济增长对投资的依赖，但动作必须非常谨慎。"

            "China’s Fire Next Time BEIJING – Earlier this year, rumors of China’s impending financial doom – triggered by either a housing-market crash or local-government debt defaults – were rampant. But, in recent months, the economy has stabilized, leaving few doubts about China’s ability to grow by more than 7% this year. Given that the Chinese government had ample scope for policy intervention, this turnaround should come as no surprise. But the moment of financial reckoning has merely been postponed, not averted. The fundamental problems that triggered alarm bells in the first place – including real-estate bubbles, local-government debt, rapid growth in shadow-banking activity, and rising corporate leverage ratios – remain unresolved. Of these, the most immediate threat to China’s economic and financial stability is the combination of high borrowing costs, low profitability for nonfinancial corporations, and very high corporate leverage ratios. According to a study by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, the debt/GDP ratio for China’s nonfinancial corporations was 113% by the end of 2012. Standard & Poor’s found that, a year later, these firms’ total debt amounted to $14.2 trillion, eclipsing the $13.1 trillion of outstanding debt in the United States and making China the world’s largest issuer of corporate debt. There is no indication that the ratio will decline anytime soon, which is particularly worrisome, given the low profitability and high borrowing costs that China’s industrial enterprises face. Indeed, Chinese firms’ profitability amounted to just over 6% last year, with 2012 profits for China’s 500 largest (mostly state-owned) corporations barely exceeding 2%. Meanwhile, interest rates on bank loans to nonfinancial enterprises remain close to 7%, despite having fallen slightly over the last year. And, in the second quarter of this year, the annualized interest rate on loans to small nonfinancial corporations surpassed 25%. With insufficient profits to use for investment, nonfinancial corporations will become increasingly dependent on external finance. As their leverage ratios increase, so will their risk premiums, causing their borrowing costs to rise and undermining their profitability further. This destructive cycle will be difficult to break. For example, if companies reduce investment, they will weaken growth and boost their leverage ratio further. To be sure, China overcame a similar challenge in its public sector from 1998 to 2001. It pursued growth-boosting investment in infrastructure and real-estate development to eliminate deflation, while maintaining artificially low interest rates to contain the rise of public debt. But a lot has changed since then. In fact, the investment-led growth model that facilitated double-digit growth in the decade after 2001 has exacerbated structural weaknesses, which must now be addressed. Indeed, China must stem the pace of real-estate investment, which accounted for more than 13% of GDP in recent years – a move that will undoubtedly lead to slower economic growth and, in turn, reduce the profitability of China’s nonfinancial corporates further. Moreover, ongoing interest-rate liberalization – which has occurred both openly and surreptitiously – means that artificially low borrowing costs have become far more difficult to maintain. Though the People’s Bank of China still officially caps interest rates on deposits, commercial banks – in cooperation with nonbank financial institutions, especially trust companies – are using wealth-management products to attract deposits with de facto free-market interest rates. As a result, the PBOC is losing control over interest rates on corporate loans, and thus has few options for constraining leverage ratios. Despite these risks, it is too early to bet on a corporate-debt crisis in China. For starters, no one knows at what corporate leverage ratio a crisis will be triggered. In 1996, when Japan’s public debt/GDP ratio reached 80%, many Japanese economists and officials worried about a looming crisis. Almost two decades later, the ratio has surpassed 200% – and still no crisis has erupted. Furthermore, China has not yet completed its market-orientated reforms, which could unleash major growth potential in many areas. Given the role that institutional factors play in China’s corporate-debt problem, such reforms could go a long way toward resolving it. China’s leaders should take advantage of this respite from instability and low confidence to redouble their reform efforts. Otherwise, they can expect alarm bells to begin ringing again – and, next time, they may not have the tools they need to silence them.",
            "中国的下一场火 北京—今年早些时候，关于中国马上就要因为房地产市场崩溃或地方政府债务违约而爆发金融崩溃的传闻日嚣尘上。 但是，最近几个月来，中国经济趋向稳定，已无多少人怀疑中国有能力在今年保持GDP增长7%以上。 中国政府有充足的政策干预空间，因此如此转折并不令人奇怪。 但金融清算的时刻只是被暂停了，而没有被消除。 在一开始敲响警钟的根本问题 — — 包括房地产泡沫、地方政府债务、影子银行活动迅速扩张、公司杠杆率高企等 — — 仍没有解决。 在这些问题中，对中国经济和金融稳定最紧迫的威胁是高借贷成本、非金融企业利润低下以及企业杠杆率畸高的组合问题。 根据中国社科院的一项研究，截至2012年末，中国非金融企业债务/GDP之比为113 % 。 标准普尔公司（Standard & Poor’s）认为，一年后，这些企业的总债务将达到14.2万亿美元，超过美国未偿还债务规模（13.1万亿美元 ） ， 使中国成为世界上第一大企业债发行国。 没有迹象表明这一比率会在短时间内下降，而这尤其令人担忧，因为中国工业企业面临着低盈利能力和高借贷成本。 事实上，去年中国企业利润率仅为6 % ， 前500大企业（大部分为国有企业）利润率勉强超过2 % 。 与此同时，尽管叫去年略有下降，非金融企业银行贷款利率仍接近7 % 。 此外，今年二季度，小型非金融企业贷款年化利率超过了25 % 。 非金融企业没有足够多的利润用于投资，因而将日益依赖外部融资。 随着它们的杠杆率的提高，风险溢价也会随之上升，导致他们的借贷成本升高，从而进一步制约利润率。 这一恶性循环很难打破。 比如，如果公司降低投资，就会危及增长，从而进一步增加杠杆率。 诚然，中国在1998—2001年期间曾经克服过公共部门类似的挑战。 当时中国追求提振增长的基础设施投资和房地产开发以消除通缩，同时人为维持低利率以遏制公共债务增加。 但此后形势发生了巨大的变化。 事实上，在2001年后的十年中推动两位数增长的投资拉动型增长模式加剧了结构性弱点，目前已到了必须纠正的地步。 事实上，中国必须遏制近几年已占GDP 13%以上的房地产投资 — — 这样做必然会导致经济增长减速，反过来进一步降低中国非金融企业的利润率。 此外，利率自由化的进行 — — 既有公开的，也有暗地的 — — 意味着人为压低的借贷成本维持难度大大加剧。 尽管中国人民银行仍对存款利率上限实施着官方上限，但商业银行 — — 在非银行金融机构特别是信托公司的合作下 — — 正在利用理财产品以事实上的自由市场利率吸引存款。 结果，中国人民银行正在失去对企业贷款利率的控制，因此也不再能够约束杠杆率。 尽管存在这些风险，但预言中国发生企业债危机仍为时尚早。 首先，没人知道多高的企业杠杆率才会触发危机。 1996年，日本公共债务/GDP之比达到了80 % ， 许多日本经济学家和官员担心危机随时可能爆发。 近二十年过去了，如今日本的这一比率已超过200 % — —但危机仍然没有爆发。 此外，中国尚未完成其市场改革，这意味着它可以在诸多领域释放巨大的增长潜力。 制度因素在中国企业债问题上仍扮演着重要角色，因此这方面的改革可以在解决企业债问题上大放异彩。 中国领导人应该利用动荡和信心不足的间歇期加倍努力实施改革。 否则，警钟将再次敲响 — — 而到那时就不一定有平息警报所必须的工具了。"

            "The Enigma of European Defense PARIS – While Europe’s citizens largely support the establishment of a common security and defense policy, most European leaders have demonstrated a clear lack of interest in creating one – including at last month’s European Council meeting. What accounts for this paradox? One possible explanation is that financially strained European governments lack the means to fulfill their citizens’ expectations. But that is unconvincing, given that the issue was framed in almost identical terms three decades ago, when budgetary constraints were not a problem. In fact, it could be argued that such constraints should spur, not impede, the creation of a European defense structure. After all, member countries would then be able to pool their resources, harmonize programs, and rationalize costs, thereby reducing individual governments’ financial burden. Another, far more credible explanation is that Europeans’ interpretations of “a more active and stronger security policy” differ widely. Indeed, current discussions in Europe concerning the use of force are dominated by three main perspectives, championed by France, the United Kingdom, and Germany. France, which has once again intervened in Africa – this time to restore order in the Central African Republic – is the only European Union country that seems genuinely interested in satisfying popular demand for more robust European security structures. The French consider Europe to be a kind of superpower – a status that implies a corresponding military capacity. While this view probably stems from France’s historical political and military prowess, it also reflects the country’s current interests. As Europe’s greatest military power (despite the UK’s larger defense budget), France would play a key role in any wide-ranging European military operation. The UK, for its part, shares France’s belief that military power is a prerequisite to strategic effectiveness. It claims that its opposition to a European defense structure stems from its belief that NATO – and thus the United States – is critical to European defense. But, given that no other EU country has seriously considered excluding NATO, this argument seems to be little more than an excuse. The truth is that the only kind of defense the British accept is that conducted by a coalition of European states acting under their national flags, as occurred in Libya. In the UK’s view, “European” operations should be limited to humanitarian and peacekeeping objectives. While it supported the fight against piracy off the Horn of Africa, that was more a policing operation than a military one, and it was guided by a shared interest in protecting trade routes from the Middle East and Asia. Germany’s vision of European defense is very different from the French and British perspectives. Unlike the UK, Germany supports a European security and defense policy, proudly highlighting its consistent military budget and major presence in European missions (larger than that of the overstretched French). And, though Germany shares the UK’s belief that NATO bears primary responsibility for protecting Europe, its view of European engagement is even more restrictive. In Germany’s view, European military intervention should be limited to the continent, and should not include combat operations. In fact, a majority of Europe’s citizens prefer that European forces be deployed only for non-combat missions. And, so far, virtually all European military operations have been aimed at evacuating European nationals, delivering humanitarian aid, or maintaining peace in the aftermath of conflict. These differing views explain the uncertainty surrounding France’s recent interventions in Africa. The French have lamented the miniscule support offered by the rest of Europe for its operations in Mali and the Central African Republic – exemplified by Germany’s refusal to create a fund for EU member-state operations. But, given the urgency of the situations in Libya, Mali, and the Central African Republic, this lack of support has not undermined France’s efforts as much as prior consultation with European leaders would have done. Had the Germans been consulted, they probably would have rejected the interventions anyway. This conflict between the need for rapid response and the requirement for deliberation explains why the EU’s much-discussed “battlegroups” are unlikely ever to be deployed. The fact that most Europeans are satisfied with limited political and military involvement outside of Europe makes increased defense cooperation even less likely. A pessimist would say that Europeans are unable – or at least unwilling – to rethink their defense policy, because the US ultimately ensures their security through NATO. According to this view, France’s efforts to encourage both transatlantic integration and autonomous political action are insufficient to change most Europeans’ minds. A more optimistic interpretation is that Europe needs defense structures that account for the role of member states – not just for that of the EU. From this perspective, Europe does have a significant military presence, whether in Afghanistan and Libya or Mali and the Central African Republic. That is a start.",
            "欧洲防务之谜 巴黎 — — 尽管欧洲民众大抵支持制定共同的安全及防务政策，但多数欧洲领导人明显对此兴味索然 — — 上个月召开的欧洲理事会会议就是实例。 是什么造成了这样的悖论？ 可能的解释之一是财政紧张的欧洲政府无力满足民众的愿望。 但这种解释不够有说服力，因为30年前就已经提出过几乎相同的问题，而当时还根本不必考虑预算限制。 事实上，这样的限制甚至应该刺激、而不是阻碍欧洲防御机制的建设。 毕竟，届时成员国就能集中利用资源、协调计划、分摊费用，从而控制个别政府的财政负担。 另外一种更为可信的解释是欧洲人对于“更积极强势安全政策”的看法大相径庭。 事实上，欧洲目前有关武力的讨论主要涉及三种观点，这三种观点分别由法国、英国和德国提出。 真正愿意满足公众强化欧洲安全结构要求的唯一国家似乎是法国，不久前它已再次对非洲进行干预 — — 这次是为实现恢复中非共和国秩序的目标。 法国将欧洲视为某种超级力量 — — 而超级力量需要具备相应的军事实力。 虽然这种观点可能与法国过往的政治和军事实力有关，但也反映了法国目前的利益。 法国是欧洲军事实力最强的国家（虽然英国国防预算的规模更大 ） ， 需要在一系列欧洲军事行动中扮演关键的角色。 英国和法国一样，相信没有军事实力就谈不上战略效率。 英国称之所以反对欧洲防务架构是因为相信北约 — — 还有美国 — — 是欧洲防务的关键要素。 但因为其他欧盟国家并没有真正考虑排斥北约，英国的说法似乎不过是一种借口。 事实是英国唯一接受的防务形式是像在利比亚那样由欧洲国家联盟各自打着本国的旗号独立行动。 英国认为人道主义和维和行动应该是“欧洲”行动的限度。 虽然它支持把海盗从非洲之角赶出去，但那次行动与其说与军方有关还不如说是为了保护从中东到亚洲贸易航线共同利益的警方行动。 德国对欧洲防务目标的看法与英法大相径庭。 和英国不同，德国支持欧洲安全与防务政策，自豪地炫耀自己稳定的军事预算和在欧洲行动中所起的重要作用（德国的作用超过捉襟见肘的法国 ） 。 而且，尽管德国同意英国保卫欧洲责任主要由北约承担的观点，但其欧洲参与观点的限制性更加严格。 德国认为欧洲军事干预应当局限在欧洲大陆，而且不应该参与战斗行动。 事实上，欧洲多数民众倾向于欧洲军队仅限于执行非战斗任务。 而且，迄今为止，欧洲几乎所有军事行动都是为了保障欧洲国民的安全撤离，此外还包括提供人道主义援助或在冲突爆发后进行维和。 这些不同意见解释了法国不久前非洲干预行动的不确定性。 法国人感叹欧洲其他国家对其马里和中非共和国行动给予的支持微乎其微 — — 德国拒绝设立欧盟成员国行动基金就是最好的例子。 但是，鉴于利比亚、马里及中非共和国事态的紧迫性，这种支持的欠缺并没有给法国军事行动带来事先咨询欧洲领导人意见那样的困扰。 如果事先征询德国的意见，他们很可能会拒绝进行干预行动。 这种快速反应和深思熟虑之间的冲突说明了欧盟讨论最多的“战斗群”为什么永远不可能真正部署。 多数欧洲人满足于对欧洲以外事务进行有限政治和军事干预的现实导致增强防务合作的可能性进一步减小。 悲观主义者会说欧洲人不能 — — 或者至少不愿 — — 重新思考其防御政策，因为美国最终通过北约保障了他们的安全需求。 按照这种说法，法国促进跨大西洋一体化和自治政治行动的努力并不足以改变多数欧洲人的想法。 更乐观的解释是欧洲需要其防御机制在明确欧盟作用的同时明确各成员国作用。 从这个角度看，欧洲的确扮演了重要的军事角色，无论在阿富汗、利比亚还是马里和中非共和国。 这不过是个开头。"

            "The GDP-Wellbeing Gap KUALA LUMPUR – The link between economic growth and human wellbeing seems obvious. Indeed, as measured by gross domestic product, economic growth is widely viewed as the ultimate development objective. But it is time to rethink this approach. In fact, there is a rising disconnect between countries’ per capita GDP and their citizens’ wellbeing, as rapid output growth exacerbates health challenges and erodes environmental conditions. Given this, people increasingly value non-material wealth just as highly as monetary wealth, if not more. But persuading policymakers and politicians of GDP’s limitations is no easy feat. After all, it is far simpler to defend a well-understood, long-accepted framework than it is to champion a new worldview. To be sure, GDP provides valuable information about a country’s production, expenditure, and income streams, as well as the flow of goods across borders. Moreover, it has provided crucial guidance to countries, helping them to track economic gains that have improved citizens’ quality of life considerably – in many cases lifting them out of destitution. But GDP fails to account for changes in a country’s stock of assets, making it difficult for policymakers to balance economic, social, and environmental concerns. Without better measures of wellbeing – including health, education, and the state of the natural environment – policymakers cannot gain the insights that they need to ensure the long-term health of the economy and the individuals who comprise it. This imperative underpins the concept of “sustainable development,” which has gradually gained acceptance since its introduction in the mid-1980’s. But, even as countries have recognized the need for a more comprehensive understanding of development, they have largely retained GDP growth as their central objective. This has to change. Even US-based Nobel laureate Simon Kuznets, the depression-era father of GDP, said in 1934 that, “the welfare of a nation can scarcely be inferred from a measure of national income.” The good news is that a robust, simple, and effective framework for measuring sustainability already exists. Developed by a group of leading economists, including the Nobel laureate Kenneth Arrow and Partha Dasgupta of the University of Cambridge, it assesses an economy’s income flows in the context of its stocks of assets, including human and natural capital. In other words, it accounts for the economy’s productive base, rather than just its monetary wealth. Based on this framework, United Nations University and the UN Environment Program unveiled the Inclusive Wealth Report (IWR) at the 2012 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. By providing a long-term comparison between GDP and “inclusive wealth” for 20 countries, the report aimed to motivate policymakers to take a more comprehensive, longer-term view of their economies’ development. This November, a second IWR will be released, with many more countries represented and a stronger focus on human capital in national-account indicators. To this end, collaborating experts will convene in Malaysia this month for a series of meetings, culminating in a public symposium entitled “Beyond Gross Domestic Product – Transitioning into Sustainability.” Transforming the world’s understanding of economic development requires a dynamic approach. Experts in various fields – including economics, sociology, psychology, and the natural sciences – must work together to develop an integrated suite of indicators that provides a comprehensive picture of humanity’s productive base, on which people’s ability to pursue their interpretation of success depends. While final decisions should rest with policymakers and citizens, the process must be guided by the best available science, uncompromised by political demands or vested interests. Moreover, one fundamental truth must be recognized: the planet cannot accommodate high-income status for all seven billion of its inhabitants. For every country to attain per capita GDP of $13,000 (which, according to the World Bank, delineates high-income status), global GDP would need to rise from roughly $72 trillion today to $91 trillion. If, however, we already use the equivalent of 1.5 earths to provide the resources we consume and to absorb our waste, the planet can sustainably support a GDP of only $48-50 trillion. And if the planet already exceeds its sustainable carrying capacity, we should be reducing our demands on it – not adding new ones. Simply put, we can no longer depend on GDP growth, and the limitless wealth accumulation that it implies, to solve our social and economic problems. The world must align its value systems with this reality. We must learn to do more with less, decouple economic growth from resource consumption, and nurture the social and spiritual aspects of our existence. This shift will be impossible without fundamental changes to our education systems, political structures, and institutions. It is a tall order, but our future depends on fulfilling it.",
            "GDP-幸福差异 吉隆坡—经济增长和人类幸福之间的联系似乎是显而易见的。 事实上，用国内生产总值衡量的经济增长被广泛认为是终极发展目标。 应该反思一下这一观点。 事实上，一国人均GDP与其人民幸福之间的联系正在日渐减弱，因为快速增长的产出放大了健康挑战、侵蚀了环境条件。 因此，人们日益向看重货币财富那样看重非物质财富。 但说服决策者和政客接受GDP的局限决非易事。 毕竟，捍卫一个易于理解并且被长期接受的框架比提出一套新的世界观简单得多。 平心而论，GDP提供了关于一国生产、支出和收入流以及跨境商品流的极有价值的信息。 此外，GDP还为各国提供关键指导，有助于它们追踪极大改善公民生活质量 — — 在许多情形里，还帮助他们摆脱了贫困 — — 的经济成果。 但GDP没有考虑一国资本存量的变化，导致决策者难以平衡经济、社会和环境问题。 没有更好的幸福指标 — — 包括健康、教育和自然环境状态等 — — 决策者就无法获得所需的信息确保经济以及组成经济的个体的长期健康。 这一紧迫任务便是“可持续发展”概念的基础。 自20世纪80年代中期引入以来，这一概念逐渐获得了接受。 但是，尽管各国已经认识到需要更全面地理解发展，但大体上它们仍将GDP增长作为核心目标。 这一点必须改变。 就连大萧条时期的GDP之父、美国诺贝尔奖获得者西蒙·库兹涅茨（Simon Kuznets）也曾在1934年说过“一国的福利很难从国民收入指标中推断 。 ” 好消息是一个鲁棒、简单、有效的可持续性衡量框架已经存在了。 由包括诺贝尔奖获得者肯尼斯·阿罗（Kenneth Arrow）和剑桥大学的帕莎·达斯古帕塔（Partha Dasgupta）在内的著名经济学家所开发的这一框架在一国的资产存量（包括人力和自然资本）背景下评估经济的收入流。 换句话说，它计算经济的生产基础，而不仅仅是它的货币财富。 基于这一框架，联合国大学和联合国环境署在2012年里约热内卢地球峰会上发布了包容性财富报告（Inclusive Wealth Report ） 。 报告给出了20个国家的长期GDP和“包容性财富”对比，旨在鼓励决策者采取更全面、更长期的经济发展观。 今年11月将发布第二份包容性财富报告，报告将增加很多国家的数据，并更关注国民账户指标中的人力资本。 在这方面，合作专家将于本月在马来西亚召开系列会议，并出版题为《超越国内生产总值 — — 向可持续性转变 》 （ Beyond Gross Domestic Product – Transitioning into Sustainability）的专题文集。 转变世界对经济发展的理解需要动态方法。 各个领域的专家 — — 包括经济学、社会学、心理学和自然科学 — — 必须合作开发一系列指标，全面勾勒人类生产基础图景，作为人们解释成功的基础。 最终决定应取决于决策者和公民，但过程必须由最有效的科学指导，杜绝政治要求和既得利益的干扰。 此外，一个根本事实必须得到承认：地球无法承受其七十亿居民全部进入高收入水平。 如果每个国家人均GDP都达到13,000美元（世界银行的高收入标准）的国家，全球GDP需要从今天的约72万亿美元增加到91万亿美元。 但是，如果我们用了相当于1.5个地球的资源来满足我们的消费、吸收我们的浪费，那么地球只能可持续地支持48—50万亿美元的GDP。 如果地球已经超出了其可持续运载的能力，我们就应该削减对它的要求 — — 不再增加新要求。 简言之，我们不能再继续依赖GDP增长及其所隐含的无限财富积累来解决我们的社会和经济问题。 世界必须让其价值体系与这一现实协调。 我们必须学会用更少的资源做更多的事，让经济增长与资源消费脱钩，培养存在的社会和精神维度。 如果没有教育体系、政治结构和制度的根本性变革，就不可能造成这一改变。 任务是艰巨的，但我们的未来取决于能否完成这一任务。"

            "A Bright Future for Africa’s Girls LUSAKA – Education gives young people the tools they need – from cognitive and social skills to self-confidence – to succeed throughout their lives. For many African countries, including my home country of Zambia, burgeoning youth populations make delivering high-quality education to all particularly urgent. But success will be possible only with a sharp focus on girls and women. Education plays a central role in determining girls’ and women’s capacity to claim economic, social, and political rights and status in society. That is why it is so important that countries place the education and empowerment of girls and women at the top of their political agendas. For Zambia, that decision is already paying off. Women now occupy powerful positions previously dominated by men, including Chief Justice, Head of the Drug Enforcement Commission, President of the Constitutional Court, Vice President, and Finance Minister. Zambian President Edgar Lungu is experiencing his own “Blair’s babes” moment (British Prime Minister Tony Blair was once photographed surrounded by 96 of the 101 female Labour MPs elected to the House of Commons in 1997) without the patronizing slogan. Of course, promoting gender equality is not just about getting women into the top levels of power. Not everyone wants to or can be a CEO or political leader. Gender equality is fundamentally about choice: giving women the same breadth of opportunities that men enjoy. Education gives girls and women the knowledge they need to make informed choices about the life they want – to become a homemaker or scientific researcher, for example, or a small business owner or the head of a multinational corporation – and the skills they need to achieve it. To support this effort, Zambia’s government has increased its investment in building technical secondary schools for girls. Moreover, to boost education quality, it has been recruiting teachers, with a focus on women. So far, 1,265 female teachers have been hired, compared to 744 male teachers. The Zambian government has also strengthened its “re-entry policy,” focused on helping young mothers return to school after childbirth. And it is buttressing its efforts with legislation, including the Gender Equity and Equality Act and an amendment to the Zambian Constitution Act. A bill to curb sexual and gender-based violence is also in the pipeline. Zambia’s progress challenges outsiders’ assumptions about what it means to be a woman in Africa. It should serve as a model for neighboring countries seeking to bolster development by improving gender equality, and as a source of hope for girls and women everywhere, giving them the confidence to dream big. But our work is far from finished. We not only need more women to be playing decisive roles at all levels of society; we must also close educational-attainment gaps between, say, urban and rural girls. Nevertheless, the future looks bright. For one thing, with the adoption of Sustainable Development Goal 4, United Nations member states have committed to “ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all” by 2030, with a focus on eliminating gender disparities. For another, high-profile figures have thrown their weight behind initiatives promoting education – and, in particular, girls’ education. Notably, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, is now a patron of the Association of Commonwealth Universities, the only accredited organization representing higher education (more than 500 universities) throughout more than 50 Commonwealth countries. Among the ACU’s key areas of work is gender equity. This is an obvious fit for the duchess, a vocal feminist, who has used her platform to encourage the empowerment of young women, including through education. For example, speaking to a group of students at the University of the South Pacific in Fiji last October, she declared, “Everyone should be afforded the opportunity to receive the education they want, but more importantly the education they have the right to receive.” She then underscored the added importance of this objective for “women and girls in developing countries.” The duchess has previously worked with organizations like One World Vision and has been an ambassador for UN Women. Perhaps most important, she has the star quality that captures young people’s attention. With her compelling personal story – in which she found her own success, lived her values, and defied expectations – she is the epitome of the modern woman, and an inspiration to girls and women throughout Africa. The advocacy of figures like the Duchess of Sussex, together with a strong commitment from governments and NGOs, suggests that the future of our young girls is bright. Now more than ever, African women can look forward to lives they choose for themselves.",
            "非洲女童的光明未来 卢萨卡—教育给予年轻人取得人生成功所需要的工具，包括认知和社会技能以及自信心等。 对许多非洲国家包括我的祖国赞比亚而言，迅速膨胀的年轻人口使得实现全民高质量教育的使命变得尤其紧迫。 但只有严重关注女童和妇女，成功才能成为可能。 在女童和妇女实现社会中的经济、社会和政治权利与地位的决定因素中，教育处于核心地位。 因此，各国必须将教育和女童及妇女赋权列为政治日程的重点。 对赞比亚，这一决定已经产生了回报。 目前妇女开始占据此前由男性主导的权力岗位，包括首席大法官、药品执法委员会主席、宪法法院院长、副总统和财政部长。 赞比亚总统伦古正在经历他的“布莱尔的孩子”时刻（1997年，英国首相布莱尔曾经与101名工党当选下议院女议员中的96人合影 ） ， 不过他没有恩庇口号。 当然，促进性别平等不仅仅是让更多妇女登上权力最顶层。 不是每个人都想或能成为CEO或政治领导人。 性别平等本质上是选择平等：给予妇女和男性一样的机会。 教育给了女童和妇女需要的知识，对她们想要的生活做出知情选择 — — 比如成为家庭主妇或科学研究者，或者成为小企业主或跨国公司主管；也给了她们实现自己的选择所需要的技能。 为了支持这一计划，赞比亚政府提高了为女童建设科技中学的投资。 此外，为了提高教育质量，赞比亚政府一直在招募教师，主要是女教师。 目前，已有1,265名女教师或聘，而男教师数量为744人。 赞比亚政府还强化了其“回归政策 ” ， 主要旨在帮助年轻母亲们在产后回到校园。 赞比亚政府还通过立法巩固政策，包括性别平等及平等性法案和赞比亚宪法修正案。 打击性和性别暴力的法案也在推进中。 赞比亚的进步打碎了外部人士关于这些措施对非洲妇女的意义的看法。 它应该成为邻国寻求通过改善性别平等促进发展的榜样，以及世界各地女童和妇女的希望之源，给予她们缔造大梦想的信心。 但我们的工作还远未结束。 我们不但需要更多的妇女在社会各界起到决定性作用；还必须填补（比如）城市和农村女童之间的入学缺口。 尽管如此，未来是光明的。 一方面，随着可持续发展目标4的实施，联合国各成员国承诺到2030年“确保包容平等的高质量教育，推动全民终身学习机会 ” ， 消除性别差距也是焦点之一。 另一方面，重要人物纷纷为促进教育尤其是女童教育的计划贡献力量。 最著名的是苏克赛斯公爵夫人梅根（Meghan ） ， 她目前是英联邦大学协会（ACU代表50多个英联邦的500多所大学的唯一的公认组织）赞助人。 性别平等也是ACU的关键工作领域之一。 这对于公爵夫人来说非常合适，作为一名积极的女权人士，她利用她的平台鼓励年轻女性赋能，教育便是赋能手段之一。 比如，她在斐济南太平洋大学的一群学生面前宣布 ， “ 每个人都应该得到接受它想要的教育的机会 。 ” 接着，她又着重强调了这一目标对“发展中国家妇女和女童”的更加重要的意义。 公爵夫人此前曾与一个世界愿景（One World Vision）等组织合作，也是联合国妇女大使。 也许最重要的是，她有赢得年轻人关注的明星气质。 她有着耀眼的个人故事 — — 取得了自己的成功，实现了她的价值，并超出了人们预期 — — 堪称现代女性的缩影，以及全非洲女童和妇女的勇气源泉。 苏赛克斯公爵夫人等人士的拥护，加上政府和非政府组织的强大承诺，表明我们的年轻女童的未来是光明的。 如今，非洲妇女比以往任何时候都更憧憬自己为自己选择的生活。"

            "Éric Zemmour and the Revenge of Vichy NEW YORK – The French journalist, television celebrity, and possible presidential candidate Éric Zemmour is having great success with his extreme reactionary views. Zemmour has suggested that Muslims must choose between their religion and France, that the deportation of Muslim immigrants is feasible, and that non-French first names should be banned. He hates “cosmopolitans” and believes that liberalism is destroying French family life. Zemmour has been sentenced twice already for racial discrimination and inciting hatred. His book, The French Suicide, published in 2014, sold more than a half-million copies in France. Polls suggest that he might get as much as 16% of the vote in next year’s presidential election. Zemmour’s way of thinking stems from a tradition going back to the French Revolution of 1789. Catholic conservatives and right-wing intellectuals, who hated the secular republic that emerged from the revolution, have long fulminated against liberals, cosmopolitans, immigrants, and other enemies of their idea of a society based on ethnic purity, obedience to the church, and family values. They were almost invariably anti-Semitic. When Jewish army Captain Alfred Dreyfus was falsely accused of betraying his country in the notorious scandal of the 1890s, they were on the side of Dreyfus’s accusers Germany’s invasion of France in 1940 gave reactionaries of this kind the chance to form a French puppet-government in Vichy. Zemmour has had kind things to say about the Vichy regime. He also has expressed some doubt about the innocence of Dreyfus. None of these views would be surprising if they came from a far-right agitator like Jean-Marie Le Pen. But Zemmour is the son of Sephardic Jewish immigrants from Algeria who lived among the Muslim Berbers. Because of the French reluctance to make ethnic or religious distinctions between citizens, Zemmour’s background is often ignored. But it might help to explain why he arrived at his extreme opinions. There is of course no reason why a Jewish person should not hold conservative views. And many Jews are passionately patriotic about their countries. But nativism among Jews in the diaspora is exceedingly rare, for obvious reasons. (Israel is a somewhat different story.) Hostility to immigrants and insistence on national purity have never done Jews any good. This is perhaps the main reason why American Jews, for example, unlike prosperous members of other minorities, such as the Irish, Italians, and increasingly Latinos, still consistently vote for Democrats. For a long time, many diaspora Jews have been keen to assimilate and become indistinguishable from the majority population. As with other minorities, this is often a matter of class: relative prosperity loosens the ties to traditional faiths and customs. But even the most ardent French, British, or American Jewish patriots tend to support their societies’ openness and oppose anti-immigrant bigotry. In France, such patriots would be mostly on the side of universal human rights and other French republican values. This would apply, for example, to the well-known philosopher Alain Finkielkraut, the son of a Polish father who survived Auschwitz. Finkielkraut fears the dangers of Islam no less than Zemmour, but he is not a nativist. The Islamic threat, in his view, is to the liberal, secular, republican ideas that Zemmour deplores. So, what drives Zemmour? How can a Jew become an anti-Dreyfusard, as it were? Perhaps the memories of the Nazi genocide and the Vichy regime’s complicity have faded so much that even a Jewish intellectual can flirt with nativist reaction without any sense of shame or fear. Or maybe he believes that stirring up French hostility to Muslims will deflect potential aggression against Jews. Many French Jews, especially the mostly Sephardic Jews living in poor neighborhoods, live in genuine fear of Muslim anti-Semitism. Zemmour is an extreme assimilationist. He cannot stop talking about his ardent love of France. Again, there is nothing unusual about that. But his family roots among the Berbers are a complicating factor. Zemmour’s attitudes are not unique to France, or to Sephardic Jews. In the Netherlands, for example, one thing some of the most fervent opponents of Muslim immigration have in common is a family history in Indonesia, the former Dutch East Indies. Geert Wilders, leader of the anti-immigrant Party for Freedom, is partly Eurasian. So are some other prominent figures in Dutch far-right politics who have an obsession with Islam. Racial hierarchies in the former colonies were complex. Eurasians in Indonesia, especially those with a Dutch education, were not just keen to be thought of as Europeans, but were fearful of being identified as Asians – let alone Muslims. Many Algerian Jews were just as eager to identify as French, and living among Muslims could easily result in hostility. Muslims in Europe not only are resented, but some Eurasians in Holland or Jews in France are terrified of being associated with them. The closest parallel might be the attitude of certain assimilated Western European Jews before the war to poor Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe. But that was more a matter of snobbery than hatred. And fellow Ashkenazi Jews were not feared. Zemmour’s hostility to Muslims has made him popular with some French Jews who have been shocked by recent acts of Islamist violence – including the murder of a rabbi and three children in Toulouse, the stabbing of an elderly Jewish woman in Paris, and other incidents. But Zemmour also has given license to bigotry among Gentiles. Le Pen himself put this succinctly in a recent interview with Le Monde. Because Zemmour is a Jew, Le Pen said, nobody could accuse him of being a Nazi, and “that gives him great freedom.” By extension, it gives more freedom to people who think like Le Pen.",
            "埃里克·泽穆尔和维希的复仇 纽约—法国记者、电视名人兼可能的总统候选人埃里克·泽穆尔以其极端反动的观点取得了巨大的成功。 泽穆尔提出穆斯林必须在其宗教和法国之间作出选择，他认为驱逐穆斯林移民的做法可行，而且法国以外的名字应当被禁用。 他憎恶“世界主义者 ， ” 认为自由主义正在摧毁法国的家庭生活。 泽穆尔因种族歧视和煽动仇恨而被判刑已经是第二次了。 其著作法国的自杀于2014年出版，在法国的销量超过50万册。 民调显示，他可能会在明年总统大选中获得多达16%的选票。 泽穆尔的思维方式来源于1789年的法国大革命传统。 天主教保守派和右翼知识分子痛恨革命后出现的世俗共和国，长期以来猛烈抨击自由主义者、世界主义者、移民和反对其思想的其他敌人，崇尚以种族纯洁、服从教会和家庭价值观为基础的社会架构。 他们几乎无一例外是反犹太主义者。 当犹太裔军队上尉阿尔弗雷德·德雷弗斯在1890年代臭名昭著的丑闻中被诬告背叛国家时，他们支持德雷弗斯的指控者。 1940年德国入侵法国导致这类反动派有机会在维希组建法国傀儡政府。 泽穆尔为维希政权说了不少好话。 他也对德雷福斯清白与否持怀疑态度。 如果来源于让-玛丽·勒庞那样的极右翼煽动分子，这样的观点恐怕没什么值得大惊小怪的。 但泽穆尔却是来自阿尔及利亚的西班牙裔犹太移民的儿子，他们长期生活在穆斯林柏柏尔人之中。 因为法国人不愿区分公民的种族或宗教背景，外界经常忽视泽穆尔的背景。 但这可能有助于说明他为什么会抱有如此极端的态度。 犹太人当然没有理由不持有保守观点。 许多犹太人衷心热爱他们的国家。 但出于显而易见的原因，在散居海外的犹太人中，本土主义是极为罕见的。 （以色列的故事略有不同。 ）对移民的敌视和对民族纯洁的坚持从来没有为犹太人带来好处。 例如，这或许可以解释为什么美国犹太人与其他少数族裔（包括爱尔兰人、意大利人和越来越多的拉丁人）富裕成员不同，依然坚持投票支持民主党。 长期以来，许多散居海外的犹太人一直热衷于同化并完全融入主流人口。 与其他少数民族一样，这往往牵涉到阶层因素：相对繁荣导致与传统信仰和习俗的联系不那么紧密了。 但即便是最狂热的法国、英国或美国犹太爱国者也倾向于支持社会开放及反对反移民偏见的态度。 在法国，这些爱国者多数支持普世人权和其他法国共和派价值观。 例如，著名哲学家阿兰·芬基尔克劳特就是如此，其父是来自奥斯维辛集中营的波兰裔幸存人员。 虽然不是本土主义者，但芬基尔克劳特与泽穆尔一样害怕伊斯兰教的危险。 在他看来，伊斯兰教正威胁着泽穆尔所痛斥的自由、世俗和共和理念。 那么，究竟是什么驱使泽穆尔这样做？ 一个犹太人怎么可能成为一个反德雷福斯主义者？ 或许对纳粹种族灭绝和维希政权通敌合谋的记忆已经消退太多，乃至于就连犹太知识分子也可以毫无羞耻或恐惧感地挑动本土主义政策。 或者他认为激起法国人对穆斯林的敌意有可能转移对犹太人的怨恨。 许多法国犹太人，尤其是生活在贫困社区的以西班牙裔为主的犹太人，都生活在穆斯林反犹主义的真实恐惧中。 泽穆尔是一个极端的同化主义者。 他无法停止谈论他热爱的法国。 同样，这也没有什么不同寻常的。 但其柏柏尔系家族根源是一个复杂的因素。 泽穆尔的态度对法国人、或西班牙裔犹太人而言绝不是独一无二的。 例如，在荷兰，那些最狂热的穆斯林移民反对者有一个共同点，那就是他们都来自前荷属东印度群岛的印度尼西亚家族。 反移民自由党领袖吉尔特·威尔德斯拥有部分欧亚血统。 荷兰极右翼政治中某些执迷于伊斯兰教的杰出人物也是一样。 前殖民地有着极为复杂的种族等级制度。 印尼的欧亚人，尤其是那些受过荷兰教育的人，不仅热衷于被视为欧洲人，而且对被视为亚洲人 — — 更不用说穆斯林非常惧怕。 许多阿尔及利亚犹太人同样渴望被认同为法国人，而生活在穆斯林中间可能很容易引来敌视态度。 欧洲穆斯林不仅遭人怨恨，而且，荷兰某些欧亚人或法国犹太人也害怕与他们扯上关系。 与此最相似的或许是战前某些被同化的西欧犹太人对东欧贫困犹太移民的态度。 但那与其说是一种仇恨还不如说是势利更为妥当。 而德系犹太人并不被人所惧怕。 泽穆尔对穆斯林的敌意使其在某些法国犹太群体中颇有威望，这些人对近期伊斯兰暴力举动感到震惊 — — 包括在图鲁兹谋杀一名拉比和三名儿童，在巴黎刺伤一位年长的犹太妇女等等。 但泽穆尔也让非犹太群体间的偏见变得光明正大。 勒庞最近在接受法国世界报采访时，对这一点进行了简要的描述。 因为泽穆尔是位犹太人，因此没人能指责他为纳粹分子，而他“因此获得了很大的自由 。 ” 推而广之，它同时也赋予了与勒庞有同样想法的人更大的自由。"

            "A Zero-Carbon Economy Is Within Reach BEIJING – When the Paris climate agreement was concluded in December 2015, almost all the world’s countries committed to limit global warming to well below 2° Celsius relative to pre-industrial levels, and have submitted “Intended Nationally Determined Contributions” (INDCs) describing how they will either contain or reduce emissions over the next decade. Global investment in renewable power now far exceeds investment in fossil fuel plants; battery costs are falling, and electric vehicle sales rising; and even in President Donald Trump’s America, coal-fired power stations continue to close. But despite this progress, the latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) contains a chilling prediction: on current trends, the world is heading toward 3°C of global warming by 2100, to a level not reached for more than a million years. The harm to human welfare is likely to be catastrophic. The IPCC report makes it clear that the ideal target should be to limit warming to 1.5°C. Above that level, the adverse consequences become ever more extreme. But to achieve that goal, global carbon dioxide emissions would have to reach net zero by about 2055, and still earlier if, as is unfortunately inevitable, emissions remain at current levels for several more years. The precise implications for acceptable emissions from power stations, industrial plants, transport networks, and heating systems depend on how rapidly emissions caused by land-use change such as deforestation can be eliminated, and how rapidly emissions of non-CO2 greenhouse gases (for example, methane or nitrous oxide) can be reduced. But it’s clear that unless we get to net zero emissions from energy use and industry by around 2060 – and earlier in developed economies – we will have to rely on the risky assumption that land-use changes can deliver large negative emissions in the late twenty-first century. Failing that, warming will rise significantly above 1.5°C. Getting to net zero emissions in just four decades will be a huge challenge. But as a forthcoming report from the Energy Transitions Commission argues, the good news is that it is undoubtedly technically possible, and at an acceptably low cost to the global economy. Moreover, we already know the key technologies we need to achieve this objective. All feasible paths to a low-carbon economy and, eventually, net zero CO2 emissions require a massive increase in the role of electricity. The share of electricity in final energy demand will have to grow from around 20% today to around 60% by mid- to late century, and total global electricity generation will have to rise dramatically, from around 25,000 TWh today to as much as 100,000 TWh. That electricity must come from low-carbon sources. And while nuclear power and gas generation offset by carbon capture may play a role, the lion’s share will have to come from renewable sources – 70-80% in the IPCC’s scenarios. But there is plenty enough land in the world to support renewable expansion on that scale, and enough time to make the necessary investments as long as we act fast. Three other sets of technologies will also be essential. First, hydrogen, ammonia, and perhaps methanol must be used as energy carriers in transport and industrial applications and as chemical feedstock inputs. All three will eventually be produced synthetically, using clean electricity as the ultimate energy source. Second, biomass could provide low-carbon aviation fuel, or feedstock for plastics production. The total scale of use, however, will need to be carefully managed to avoid harmful impacts on ecosystems and food supply. Third, there should be at least some role for carbon capture, and either storage or use, in key industrial processes such as cement production, where viable alternative routes to decarbonization are currently unavailable. Building a zero-carbon economy will of course require massive investment in power production and transmission, new industrial plants, and more efficient equipment. To achieve the 1.5°C objective, the IPCC estimates that the required additional global investment, from 2015 to 2050, could be $900 billion per annum. That may seem like a startlingly high figure; but, assuming 3% annual economic growth, global GDP, which stands at almost $100 trillion today, could reach $260 trillion by 2050. This implies that the world needs to invest less than 0.6% of its income over the next four decades to avoid potentially catastrophic harm to human welfare. China alone currently invests more than $5 trillion each year, a significant proportion of which is wasted on the construction of apartment blocks which will never be occupied in cities which face static and eventually declining populations. By redirecting investment, China could build a zero-carbon economy without any sacrifice of consumption. For the world as a whole, the impact on living standards of achieving net zero emissions will be trivial. But while a zero-carbon economy is undoubtedly technically feasible and easily affordable, it will not be achieved without strong public policies and forward-looking business strategies. Governments must deliver carbon pricing and product regulation and support key technologies and infrastructures, and companies in the energy-producing and main energy-using sectors must develop strategies focused on how to achieve zero emissions by mid-century and how to begin the transition today. The alternative is another decade of only incremental progress, which will put us on a catastrophic path toward 3°C warming within the lifetime of today’s children.",
            "零碳经济触手可及 发自北京 — — 当巴黎气候协议于2015年12月签署时，几乎所有世界上的国家都承诺将全球变暖程度限制在相对工业化前水平不高于2摄氏度的水平，并各自提交了《国家自主贡献》文件以解释如何在未来十年内控制或减少排放。 目前，全球对可再生能源的投资远远超过对化石燃料工厂的投资；电池成本下降，电动汽车销量上升；甚至在特朗普治下美国，燃煤发电站也在陆续关停。 但尽管取得了这一进展，政府间气候变化专门委员会最新发布的报告仍然做出一个令人不寒而栗的预测：就目前的趋势而言，到2100年时世界会升温达3摄氏度，也是超过100万年来都未曾达到的水平。 对人类福利而言，这可能是灾难性的。 委员会报告明确指出理想的目标应该是将升温限制在1.5摄氏度。 一旦超过这个水平则后果将变得更为极端。 但要实现这一目标，全球二氧化碳排放量必须在2055年左右达到净零水平，而鉴于排放量会可悲且不可避免地在目前水平上保持多几年，所以这一目标还得相应提前。 而发电站，工业厂房，运输网络和供暖系统的被许可排放的确切影响则取决于由森林砍伐等土地性质变化所造成的排放可以以多快的速度被消除，以及非二氧化碳温室气体（比如甲烷或氧化亚氮）的排放减少速度。 但很显然的是，除非我们在2060年左右实现能源使用和工业的净零排放 — — 而且发达经济体还要提早一些 — — 否则就将不得不依赖于可能站不住脚的假设，即土地使用变化可以在21世纪末产生大量的负排放。 如果做不到这一点，气温将在1.5摄氏度以上显著上升。 在短短四十年内实现净零排放将是一个巨大的挑战。 但正如能源转型委员会即将发布的一份报告所指出的那样，好消息是它在技术上无疑是可行的，而且为全球经济带来的成本也可以接受。 此外我们已经知晓了实现这一目标所需的关键技术。 通往低碳经济（以及最终的零二氧化碳净排放）的所有可行途径都需要大力提升电力的作用。 最终能源需求中的电力份额必须由当前的约20％增长到本世纪中后期的60％左右，为此全球总发电量必须大幅增加，从目前的约2.5万太瓦时增加到10万太瓦时。 而这些电力必须来自低碳源头。 虽然核电以及被碳捕获所抵消的天然气发电可能起到一定作用，但最大的份额必须来自可再生能源 — — 在政府间气候变化专门委员会设定的情景中占到70~80 ％ 。 但其实世界上有足够的土地支持这种规模的可再生能源扩张，只要我们采取快速行动，就有足够的时间进行必要的投资。 另外三套技术也是必不可少的。 首先，氢气，氨气和甲醇必须被用作运输和工业应用中的能量载体以及化学原料输入。 所有这三种产物最终将实现合成生产，并使用清洁电力作为最终能源。 其次，生物质可以用来提供低碳航空燃料或用作塑料生产原料。 但同时需要谨慎管理其总使用规模以避免对生态系统和粮食供应产生有害影响。 第三，在水泥生产等关键工业生产流程中碳捕获（不管是储存还是使用）都至少应该起到一定的作用，因为目前在这些行业还未能开发出可行的脱碳替代路径。 同时建立零碳经济当然需要在电力生产和输电，新工厂和更高效设备方面进行大量投资。 政府间气候变化专门委员会预计，为达到1.5摄氏度的目标就必须在2015~2050年间在全球范围内每年追加投资达9000亿美元。 这可能看起来像一个惊人的数字；但假设年经济增长率达到3 ％ ， 那么当前累计近100万亿美元的全球GDP到2050年时将达260万亿美元。 这意味着世界只需要在未来40年内投入不到0.6％的收入就可以避免对人类福祉的潜在灾难性伤害。 仅中国一国每年的投资额就超过5万亿美元，只不过其中绝大部分都被浪费在了一些永远不会有人居住的公寓楼建设上 — — 它们所在的城市走向寂静且最终人口下降。 通过重新定向投资，中国可以在不牺牲消费的情况下建立零碳经济。 对整个世界而言，实现净零排放对生活水平的影响微不足道。 而虽然零碳经济显然在技术上可行且经济上负担得起，但如果没有强有力的公共政策和前瞻性的商业战略就无法实现。 政府必须提供碳定价和产品监管并支持关键技术和基础设施，能源生产和主要能源使用部门的企业必须制定战略，重点关注如何在本世纪中叶实现零排放以及如何立刻开始转型。 而另一种选择是继续度过一个仅有渐进式进步的十年，而我们的孩子们也会在有生之年走上3摄氏度升温的灾难性道路。"

            "Our Zero-Emission Future NEW YORK – The solution to human-induced climate change is finally in clear view. Thanks to rapid advances in zero-carbon energy technologies, and in sustainable food systems, the world can realistically end greenhouse-gas emissions by mid-century at little or no incremental cost, and with decisive benefits for safety and health. The main obstacle is inertia: politicians continue to favor the fossil-fuel industry and traditional agriculture mainly because they don’t know better or are on the take. Most global warming, and a huge burden of air pollution, results from burning fossil fuels: coal, oil, and gas. The other main source of environmental destruction is agriculture, including deforestation, excessive fertilizer use, and methane emissions from livestock. The energy system should shift from heavily polluting fossil fuels to clean, zero-carbon energy sources such as wind and solar power, and the food system should shift from feed grains and livestock to healthier and more nutritious products. This combined energy-and-food transformation would cause net greenhouse-gas emissions to fall to zero by mid-century and then become net negative, as atmospheric carbon dioxide is absorbed by forests and soils. Reaching net-zero emissions by mid-century, followed by negative emissions, would likely secure the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5º Celsius relative to Earth’s pre-industrial temperature. Alarmingly, warming has already reached 1.1ºC, and the global temperature is rising around 0.2ºC each decade. That’s why the world must reach net-zero emissions by 2050 at the latest. The shift toward clean energy would prevent hundreds of thousands of deaths each year from air pollution, and the shift to healthy, environmentally sustainable diets could prevent around ten million deaths per year. A low-cost shift to clean energy is now feasible for every region of the world, owing to the plummeting costs of solar and wind power, and breakthroughs in energy storage. The total system costs of renewable energy, including transmission and storage, are now roughly on par with fossil fuels. Yet fossil fuels still get government preferences through subsidies, as a result of incessant lobbying by Big Coal and Big Oil, and the lack of planning for renewable alternatives. The key step is a massive increase in power generation from renewables, mainly wind and solar. Some downstream energy uses, such as automobile transport and home heating, will be directly electrified. Other downstream users – in industry, shipping, aviation, and trucking – will rely on clean fuels produced by renewable electricity. Clean (zero-emission) fuels include hydrogen, synthetic liquids, and synthetic methane. At the same time, farms should shift toward plant-based foods. Asia’s continued construction of coal plants, together with ongoing deforestation in Southeast Asia, Africa, and Brazil, is putting our climate, air, and nutrition at huge and wholly unnecessary risk. In the United States, the Trump administration’s promotion of fossil fuels, despite American’s vast renewable-energy potential, adds to the absurdity. So does the renewed call by Brazil’s new populist president, Jair Bolsonaro, to develop – that is, to deforest – the Amazon. So, what to do? The most urgent step now is to educate governments and businesses. National governments should prepare technical engineering assessments of their countries’ potential to end greenhouse-gas emissions by mid-century. And businesses and banks should urgently examine the technologically compelling case for clean, safe energy and food systems. An important new study shows that every world region has the wind, solar, and hydropower potential to decarbonize the energy system. Countries at higher latitudes, such as the US, Canada, northern European countries, and Russia, can tap relatively more wind than tropical countries. All countries can shift to electric cars, and power trucks, ships, planes, and factories on new zero-carbon fuels. This energy transition will create millions more jobs than will be cut in the fossil-fuel industries. Shareholders in companies like ExxonMobil and Chevron that refuse to acknowledge the coming energy transition will end up paying a heavy price. Their ongoing fossil-fuel investments will be stranded assets in future years. Governments and utility commissions should require that all new power-generating capacity is zero carbon. As old fossil-fuel plants age and are shut down, they should be replaced by clean power generation on a competitive basis, for example through renewable-energy auctions. China and India, in particular, should stop building new coal-fired power plants at home, and capital-exporting countries like China and Japan should stop financing new coal-fired plants in the rest of Asia, such as Pakistan and the Philippines. Private-sector firms will compete intensively to lower still further the costs of renewable energy systems, including power generation, energy storage, and downstream uses such as electric vehicles, electric heating and cooking, and the new hydrogen economy. Governments should set limits on emissions, and the private sector should compete to deliver low-cost solutions. Government and business together should finance new research and development to drive costs even lower. The story with land use is the same. If Bolsonaro really thinks he’s going to bring about a Brazilian economic boom by opening the Amazon to further deforestation for soybeans and cattle ranches, he should think again. Such an effort would isolate Brazil and force the major downstream food companies, facing the threat of a massive global consumer backlash, to stop buying Brazilian products. Consumer foods are going another way. The big news is that Burger King, in a new venture with Impossible Foods, is moving toward plant-based burgers. Impossible burgers taste just like beef burgers, but smart chemistry using plant-based ingredients allows burger lovers to savor their meal while saving the planet.

            "我们的零排放未来 纽约 — — 解决人类所引发气候变化的方案终于清晰可见。 由于零碳能源技术及可持续粮食体系的迅速发展，世界可以到本世纪中叶以不增加或很少增加成本的方式实际结束温室气体排放，并为安全和健康带来决定性的福祉。 惯性是主要的障碍：政治家继续支持化石燃料工业和传统农业，主要原因是他们不了解情况或者从上述集团获取利益。 多数全球变暖，以及巨大的空气污染负担，均为燃烧煤、石油和天然气等化石燃料所带来的产物。 环境破坏的另一个主要来源是农业，包括森林砍伐、过度使用化肥和牲畜排放甲烷。 能源系统应当从污染严重的化石燃料转向风能及太阳能等清洁零碳能源，而粮食体系也应当从饲料谷物和牲畜朝着更健康也更有营养的产品过渡。 类似这种能源和粮食的综合转化到本世纪中会导致温室气体净排放下降至零，而后再随着大气中的二氧化碳被森林及土壤逐步吸收而下降为负数。 截至本世纪中叶实现零净排放，再继之以负排放，很有可能确保实现将全球变暖限制在相对于地球前工业化时期1.5摄氏度以内的水平。 令人担忧的是，全球变暖已经达到1.1摄氏度，而全球温度每10年均以约0.2摄氏度左右的温度上升。 这解释了为什么全世界必须最晚在2050年前达到零净排放的原因。 向清洁能源转型将每年防止数十万人死于空气污染，而像健康及环境可持续饮食的过渡则可以每年少死约1，000万人。 由于太阳能和风能成本骤降，以及在能源存储领域所取得的突破，朝着低成本、清洁能源领域的转变现在在世界所有地区都已成为可行。 包括传输和储存在内的可再生能源总系统成本现在已经与化石燃料大体持平。 但由于大型煤炭和石油企业的不断游说，以及缺少可再生能源方面的具体规划，化石燃料仍然通过补贴取得政府的优先支持。 关键步骤是大幅增加可再生能源发电，主要包括风能和太阳能。 汽车运输和家庭取暖等某些下游能源应用领域将直接实现电气化。 其他下游用户 — — 包括工业、航运、航空以及卡车运输业 — — 将依赖可再生电力生产的清洁燃料运行。 清洁（零排放）原料包括氢、合成液体以及合成甲烷等品种。 与此同时，农场应当转而种植植物性食品。 亚洲持续建设燃煤发电厂、加之东南亚、非洲和巴西不断持续的森林砍伐，正导致我们的气候、空气和营养陷入到巨大而且完全不必要的危险之中。 在美国，尽管美国人有着巨大的可再生能源潜力，但特朗普政府的化石燃料推广却进一步助长了这样的荒谬性。 类似的还有巴西新任民粹主义总统贾伊尔·波索纳罗再次呼吁开发 — — 其实也就是砍伐 — — 亚马逊热带雨林。 那么，我们应当怎么做？ 教育政府和企业是目前最迫切的步骤。 各国政府应开展技术工程评估，以了解各自国家截至本世纪中叶结束温室气体排放的可能性。 而企业和银行应紧急审查那些在清洁安全能源和粮食系统领域具有技术吸引力的案例。 一项全新重要研究表明，世界各地均具有可以使能源系统脱碳的风能、太阳能和水利发电方面的潜力。 美国、加拿大、北欧国家和俄罗斯等高纬度国家相对而言可以使用的风力资源比赤道国家要多的多。 所有国家都可以转而使用电动车、电动卡车、轮船、飞机，并且修建新型零碳燃料企业。 上述能源转型将创造出比化石燃料行业削减岗位多数百万个工作机会。 拒绝承认即将到来能源转型的埃克森·美孚和雪佛龙等企业股东将为此付出沉重的代价。 他们正在进行的化石燃料投资将于未来几年成为闲置资产。 政府及公用事业委员会应当要求所有新增发电能力必须为零碳性质。 随着原有化石燃料发电厂逐步老化和关闭，必须由通过可再生能源拍卖等途径并具有竞争力的清洁发电企业来取而代之。 尤其是中国和印度应当停止在本国兴建新的燃煤发电厂，而像中国和日本这样的资本输出国应当停止为巴基斯坦和菲律宾等亚洲其他地区的新建燃煤发电厂提供资金。 私营部门企业将激烈竞争以进一步降低可再生能源体系成本，包括发电、储能和电动汽车、电取暖及烹饪等下游应用，并建立全新的氢经济模型。 各国政府应限制排放，而私营部门应当为提供低成本解决方案而展开竞争。 政府和企业应共同出资进行新的研究和开发，目的是进一步降低成本。 同样的原则也适用于土地利用。 如果波索纳罗真的认为他可以通过进一步砍伐亚马逊种植大豆和开辟牧场来实现巴西经济繁荣，那么他应当慎之又慎。 这样的工作将会孤立巴西，并迫使主要下游食品企业在面对全球消费者大规模抗议的情况下，停止购买巴西产品。 消费食品正走上另一条路。 爆炸性新闻是汉堡王，在与不可思议食品共同筹建的新合资企业的同时，正尝试向以植物为基础的汉堡转型。 “不可能”汉堡尝上去像是牛肉汉堡，但使用植物成分的智能化学可以让汉堡爱好者在拯救地球的同时尽情享受他们的食品。 通过改变我们的能源和粮食系统，我们可以享受低成本的能源和令人满意的健康饮食，而同时还不破坏自然环境。 为气候安全而战的高中生完成了自己的家庭作业。 像特朗普和波索纳罗这样的政治家需要贡献自己的一份力量，不要阻拦对抗气候变化的进程。"

            "The Zero-Sum Economy LONDON – Across the global economy, the potential for automation seems huge. Adidas’ “Speedfactory” in Bavaria will employ 160 workers to produce 500,000 pairs of shoes each year, a productivity rate over five times higher than in typical factories today. The British Retail Consortium estimates that retail jobs could fall from three million to 2.1 million within ten years, with only a small fraction replaced by new jobs in online retailing. Many financial-services companies see the potential to cut information-processing jobs to a small fraction of current levels. And yet, despite all this, measured productivity growth across the developed economies has slowed. One possible explanation, recently considered by Andrew Haldane, chief economist of the Bank of England, is that while some companies rapidly grasp the new opportunities, others do so only slowly, producing a wide productivity dispersion even within the same sector. But dispersion alone cannot explain slowing productivity growth: that would require an increase in the degree of dispersion. However, to focus on how technology is applied to existing jobs may be to look in the wrong place, for the clue to the productivity paradox may instead be found in the activities to which displaced workers move. David Graeber of the London School of Economics argues that as much as 30% of all work is performed in “bullshit jobs,” which are unnecessary to produce truly valuable goods and services but arise from competition for income and status. Graeber usefully views the world from the perspective of an anthropologist, not an economist. But the phrase “bullshit jobs” and his focus on demotivated workers doing pointless work may divert attention from the essential development: individual workers may regard as stimulating and valuable many jobs which cannot in aggregate contribute to total welfare. Suppose, for example, that you cared passionately about the objectives of a particular charity, had a flair for fundraising, and successfully increased that charity’s share of available donations. You would probably feel both motivated and good, even if all you had done was divert money from another charity about which another equally motivated fundraiser was equally passionate. The crucial economic question, therefore, is not whether individual jobs are “bullshit,” but whether they increasingly perform a zero-sum distributive function, whereby the dedication of ever more skill, effort, and technology cannot increase human welfare, given the skill, effort, and technology applied on the other side of the competitive game. Numerous jobs fall into that category: cyber criminals and the cyber experts employed by companies to repel their attacks; lawyers (both personal and corporate); much of financial trading and asset management; tax accountants and revenue officials; advertising and marketing to build brand X at the expense of brand Y; rival policy campaigners and think tanks; even teachers seeking to ensure that their students achieve the higher relative grades that underpin future success. Measuring what share of all economic activity is zero sum is inherently difficult. Many jobs involve both truly creative and merely distributive activities. And zero-sum activities can be found in all sectors; manufacturing companies can employ tax accountants to minimize liabilities and top executives who focus on financial engineering. But available figures suggest that zero-sum activities have grown significantly. As Gary Hamel and Michele Zanini point out in a recent Harvard Business Review article, some 17.6% of all US jobs, receiving 30% of all compensation, are in “management and administrative” functions likely to involve significant zero-sum activity. Meanwhile employment in financial and “business services” firms has grown from 15% to 18% of all US jobs in the last 20 years, and from 20% to 24% of measured output. Hamel and Zanini argue that if we could only strip out unnecessary management jobs, productivity could soar. But the growth of zero-sum activities may be more inherent than they believe. As technological progress makes us ever richer in terms of many basic goods and services – whether cars or household appliances, restaurant meals or mobile phone calls – it may be inevitable that more human activity is devoted to zero-sum competition for available income and assets. As our ability to produce higher-quality goods with fewer people increases, value may come to lie more and more in subjective brands, and rational firms will devote resources to activities like market analysis, financial engineering, and tax planning. Eventually, almost all human work might be devoted to zero-sum activities. Whether or not robots will ever achieve human-level intelligence, it is illuminating to consider what an economy would look like if we could automate almost all the work required to produce the goods and services human welfare requires. There are two possibilities: one is a dramatic increase in leisure; the other is that ever more work would be devoted to zero-sum competition. Given what we know about human nature, the second development seems likely to play a significant role. As I argued in a recent lecture, such an economy would probably be a very unequal one, with a small number of IT experts, fashion designers, brand creators, lawyers, and financial traders earning enormous incomes. Paradoxically, the most physical thing of all – locationally desirable land – would dominate asset values, and rules on inheritance would be a key determinant of relative wealth. In John Maynard Keynes’s words, we would have solved “the economic problem” of how to produce as many goods and services as we want , but would face the more difficult and essentially political questions of how to achieve meaning in a world where work is no longer needed, and how to govern fairly the inherent human tendency toward status competition. Seeking to resolve these challenges through accelerated technological development and faster productivity growth would be like pursuing a mirage.",
            "零和经济 发自伦敦 — — 纵观全球经济，自动化的潜力似乎相当大。 阿迪达斯设在德国巴伐利亚州的“速度工厂”鞋履年生产量达50万双，但只需雇佣160名工人，生产率比目前典型的工厂要高出五倍。 英国零售商协会预计零售业岗位数量可能会在未来十年内从300万减少到210万，而且其中只有一小部分被在线零售业的新职位所取代。 许多金融服务企业也觉得可以将信息处理员工的数量削减到当前水平的几分之一。 可即便如此，发达经济体的生产率增长速度依然在走下坡路。 对此英格兰银行首席经济学家安德鲁·霍尔丹（Andrew Haldane）最近思考得出的一个可能的解释是，虽然一些公司迅速把握住了新的机遇，但其他公司却反应迟钝，即使在同一行业部门内也会产生广泛的生产率不均状况。 但仅仅是不均还无法解释生产率增长放缓：因为这还需要提升不均的程度。 然而，关注技术如何应用​​于那些现有就业职位可能是在错误的，因为这种生产率悖论的线索反而可能在那些失业工人的活动中找到。 伦敦经济学院的大卫·格雷伯（David Graeber）认为有多达30％的工作都是以“垃圾工作（bullshit jobs ） ” 的形式存在，这些工作不会生产真正有价值的商品和服务，而只是在争夺收入和地位。 格雷伯的可贵之处在于从人类学家而非经济学家的角度去观察这个世界。 但是“垃圾工作”这一短语以及他对那些无精打采地从事着无意义工作的人们的关注可能会转移了我们对基本发展的注意力：许多工作可能在总体上无益于全体福利，但在个人看来却是既振奋人心又有价值的。 比如说，假设您对某个慈善机构所设立的目标非常热衷，同时又拥有筹款的天赋，并成功增加了该机构在总体善款中所占的份额。 即使您所做的一切都是从另一个慈善机构 — — 其背后也有另一个同样富有冲劲且同样充满激情的筹款者 — — 把钱挪过来，您可能依然会感到既踌躇满志又造福人类。 可见关键的经济问题并不是一个人工作是否“垃圾 ” ， 而在于他们是否越来越多地在执行着零和式的分配功能，其所贡献的更多技能，努力和技术都无法增加人类福祉，而是被用在了竞争游戏的某一个对立面。 许多工作都属于这一范畴：网络犯罪分子和企业雇用去击退这类他们的网络专家；律师（无论是为个人还是企业服务的 ） ； 大部分金融交易和资产管理；税务会计师和税务官员；以牺牲品牌Y为代价建立品牌X的广告和营销；针锋相对的政策活动家和智库；甚至是那些希望确保自己学生拿到相对更高分数从而迈向光明未来的教师。 衡量所有经济活动中究竟有多大比例属于零和本身就极为困难。 许多工作都会涉及真正创造性以及纯粹分配性的活动。 在各行各业中都可以找到零和活动；一个制造企业可以聘请帮忙减少应缴税费的税务会计师以及专注于金融工程的高级管理人员。 但现有数据显示零和活动正在显著增长。 正如加里·汉梅尔（Gary Hamel）和米盖尔·扎尼尼（Michele Zanini）最近发表的《哈佛商业评论》文章中所指出的那样，美国所有就业岗位中约有17.6 ％ （ 占总薪酬的30 ％ ） 属于可能涉及大量零和活动的“管理和行政”职能 ， 。 与此同时，金融和“商业服务”类公司的就业人数占美国就业岗位的比例在过去20年中从15％增长到了18 ％ ， 其占总经济产出的比率则从20％增加到了24 ％ 。 汉梅尔和扎尼尼认为只要我们能剥离掉那些毫无必要的管理工作，生产力就会飙升。 但零和活动的增长可能比他们认为的更为根深蒂固。 随着技术进步使我们在许多基本商品和服务方面变得更加宽裕 — — 无论是汽车还是家用电器，餐馆用餐还是移动电话 — — 更多的人类活动也不可避免地被用于针对现有收入和资产进行零和竞争。 随着我们以更少人员生产更高质量商品的能力不断提升，价值可能越来越多地体现在主观性的品牌之上，而那些理性企业则会把资源投入到市场分析，金融工程和税收筹划等活动中。 最终几乎所有的人类工作都可能被用于零和活动。 在此我们可以思考一个具有启发性的问题：无论机器人是否能够达到跟人类同等的智能，如果我们能够自动完成人类福利所需的产品和服务所需的几乎所有工作，那时的经济将会是什么样子呢？ 这有两种可能性：一个是闲余时间急剧增加；另一个是更多的工作将用于零和竞争。 依我们对人性的了解，第二种走向似乎将发挥重要作用。 正如我在最近的一次讲座中所说，这样的经济可能是一个非常不平等的经济体，少数IT专家，时装设计师，品牌创造者，律师和金融交易者赚取了巨额收入。 矛盾的是，最具有物理意义的东西 — — 那些位置理想的土地 — — 将主导资产价值，而继承规则将成为相对财富的关键决定因素。 照约翰·梅纳德·凯恩斯的话来说，我们已经解决了如何按照自己的意愿去尽可能多地生产商品和服务的“经济问题 ” ， 但是在一个不再需要工作的世界里，我们将面临着如何实现人生意义这个更加困难和根本的政治问题，以及如何公平地治理人类内在的地位竞争倾向。 而试图寻求通过加速技术开发和更快的生产力增长来解决这些挑战则无异于猴子捞月。"

            "Zika and Reproductive Rights NEW YORK – Mosquitoes know no boundaries, and neither does fear. As public-health experts grapple with the Zika virus, panic continues to spread around the world. Yet the crisis has brought to light two important truths. The first revelation is how badly degraded public health systems have become, across Latin America and beyond. This did not happen by chance. In large part, it is the result of pressure on developing countries by concessionary lenders, such as the International Monetary Fund, to cut social sector expenses, including health spending, beginning in 1980. In Brazil and elsewhere, state authorities could have deployed well-known and cost-effective measures to control mosquito-borne diseases, but they did not. Their most affected citizens, who tend to be poor, have been forced to live with the consequences. Second, the Zika epidemic has revealed, with particular poignancy, another dire threat to public health: the denial of women’s reproductive rights. Governments are shirking their responsibility in this regard too, often in a grotesque manner. The reported spike in cases of microcephaly – a birth defect – among infants in Zika-affected areas led the governments of Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, and El Salvador to warn their female citizens “not to become pregnant.” This message, which places the blame and burden of the Zika epidemic on women, is as unjust as it is unreasonable. It is also toothless, as many women in the region do not have access to contraception or safe abortions. The Zika crisis has highlighted an obvious reality: Not providing women with reproductive health information and services places their lives – and those of their children – at grave risk. Latin America’s abortion laws are among the world’s most restrictive. El Salvador, for example, bans abortion in all circumstances and has incarcerated women who have gone to emergency rooms after miscarriages, charging them with seeking illegal abortions. Contraception can also be expensive or difficult to access across the region, despite high rates of teenage rape and pregnancy. The result, especially with the addition of the Zika virus, is a recipe for tragedy. Brazil, the Latin American country hit hardest by the virus so far, is emblematic of the problem: Abortion is allowed only in cases of rape, danger to the woman’s life, or in the case of fetal anencephaly (the absence of a major portion of the brain). In response to the Zika crisis, Brazil should immediately allow abortion in cases of suspected microcephaly as well. The loosening of restrictions, however, should not stop there. Over the last few years, conservatives in the Brazilian Congress have been trying to place limits on abortion in cases of rape. These efforts – which demonstrate complete disregard for the rights and dignity of women – must end. Instead, women’s right to seek an abortion should be expanded – and quickly. Governments must also ensure that services are accessible and affordable. Wealthy Brazilian women can afford to pay private health providers for safe abortions. Poor women are forced to resort to poorly trained and equipped providers who operate in unsanitary conditions, sometimes as part of criminal networks. In September 2014, two women died in Rio de Janeiro following clandestine abortions. In the region overall, 95% of abortions are unsafe. In Latin America and the Caribbean, 62% of women aged 15-49 want to avoid a pregnancy. But nearly a quarter of these women are not using an effective method of birth control. Expense is only one barrier for poor women and girls; another is the lack of information. Men and women need comprehensive sexuality education, so they are informed about their reproductive health and family planning options and know where they can get modern contraceptives. Recent evidence suggesting that Zika might be transmitted sexually adds extra urgency to making male and female condoms and other contraceptives widely available. The movement for reproductive rights has a long history in Brazil and in other parts of Latin America. Over the last several months – even before Zika – feminists had been taking to the streets in outrage at the lack of access to safe and legal abortions. The Zika crisis may mark a turning point in the fight for women’s health and equality. It is certainly a wake-up call for governments everywhere to rebuild and strengthen public health systems, and to guarantee all women and girls access to contraceptives and safe abortions. Women and girls around the world know the alternative – and it is terrifying.",
            "寨卡和生育权 纽约—蚊子不知道有国界这回事，也不懂得恐慌。 如今，公共卫生专家正在集中关注寨卡病毒，而恐惧继续在全世界蔓延。 但这场危机让我们看到了两个重要事实。 第一个事实是拉丁美洲和其他地区公共卫生体系倒退严重。 这绝不是偶然。 从很大程度上说，这是拜国际货币基金（IMF）等优惠贷款人所赐。 从1980年开始，这些优惠贷款人施加越来越大的压力要求削减社会部门支出，包括卫生支出。 在巴西和其他国家，有关部门本来能力部署著名的高性价比措施控制蚊子传播的传染病，但它们没有这样做。 而受影响最大的国民往往是穷人，他们被迫承受后果。 其次，尤其讽刺的是，寨卡疫情曝光了另外一个公共卫生的严峻威胁：剥夺妇女生育权。 政府在这方面也在推脱责任，手段往往荒唐。 据报道，寨卡疫区婴儿小头症（一种出生缺陷）概率飙升让巴西、哥伦比亚、厄瓜多尔和萨尔瓦多政府警告女性公民“不要怀孕 ” 。 这一做法将寨卡疫情的责任和负担都推给了妇女，是不公平也不合理的。 这也是无能的表现，因为该地区许多妇女根本无法获得避孕和安全堕胎。 寨卡危机彰显出一个显而易见的现实：不向妇女提供生殖健康信息和服务让她们 — — 以及她们的孩子 — — 的生命处于非常危险的境地。 拉丁美洲的堕胎法堪称世界最严。 比如，萨尔瓦多禁止一切情况下的堕胎行为，任何妇女，如果她因为流产而进入急诊室，都会遭到监禁，被控试图非法堕胎。 避孕在该地区也很昂贵并且很难获得，尽管青少年强奸和怀孕现象十分普遍。 结果是反复发生悲剧，特别是在寨卡病毒爆发的情况下。 目前，拉丁美洲受寨卡病毒影响最大的国家是巴西，它也成为这一问题的象征：堕胎只有在遭遇强奸、危及妇女生命或致命无脑儿（缺少大脑的主要部分）等情况才被允许。 为了应对寨卡危机，巴西应该立刻允许疑似小脑症的情况也进行堕胎。 但是，放松限制不能仅限于此。 在过去几年中，巴西国会中的保守派一直在试图限制被强奸后堕胎。 这些做法必须叫停，因为它们完全无视妇女的权利和尊严。 相反，妇女寻求堕胎的权利应该扩大 — — 迅速扩大。 政府还必须确保服务能得到普及和平价化。 富裕的巴西妇女能够负担私人安全��胎服务。 贫困女性被迫在技术低劣、设备落后的诊所（有时甚至是犯罪团伙）在不卫生的条件下接受堕胎手术。 2014年9月，两名妇女在里约热内卢接受地下脱胎后死亡。 在整个地区，95%的堕胎为不安全堕胎。 在拉丁美洲和加勒比海地区，62%的15—49岁女性希望避免怀孕。 但这些女性中有近四分之一用不上有效的生育控制方法。 对贫困妇女和女孩来说，开支只是其中一个壁垒；另一个壁垒是信息不通。 女性和女性都需要全面的性教育，这样才能了解自己的生殖卫生条件和家庭规划选择，知道如何获得现代避孕技术。 最新证据显示，寨卡病毒可能经由性途径传播，这更加增加了普及男用和女用避孕套和其他避孕手段的紧迫性。 生育权运动在巴西和其他拉丁美洲国家由来已久。 在过去几个月中 — — 甚至在寨卡病毒爆发前 — — 女权主义者一直在举行街头游行愤怒地倾诉她们无法获得安全和合法的堕胎。 寨卡危机可能是妇女卫生和平等地位斗争的转折点。 它毫无疑问是所有国家的警钟：必须重建和强化公共卫生系统，并保证所有妇女和女孩获得避孕和安全堕胎。 全世界妇女和女孩都知道否则的话会怎样 — — 令人颤抖。"

            "The Injustices of Zika SOUTHAMPTON – Outbreaks of communicable diseases in the developing world are bad enough from a health perspective. But they also have serious implications for social justice, because they exacerbate longstanding human-rights crises, including by undermining already-weak public-services provision and deepening existing inequalities. Like the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, the Zika outbreak in Central and South America in 2015 hit vulnerable social groups – women and children, ethnic minorities, and the poor – the hardest. Like yellow fever, dengue, and other diseases, Zika is transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. But, unusually for a mosquito-borne virus, Zika can also be transmitted sexually. Even more unusual, it is associated with neurological and developmental conditions affecting babies: microcephaly and Guillain-Barré syndrome. Otherwise, its symptoms are often rather mild. This means that, of the more than 1.5 million people stricken by Zika since the outbreak, the consequences were most worrying for women of child-bearing age, especially those who were already pregnant. Between 2016 and 2017, a total of 11,059 Zika cases in pregnant women were confirmed, producing 10,867 cases of microcephaly and other congenital malformations of their babies’ central nervous systems. Fifty-six percent of those babies were born to poor women and women of color from northeast Brazil. Clearly,the Zika crisis is not gender-neutral. In addressing its medium- to long-term consequences, a focus on women – especially poor women – is needed. That does not mean more media coverage of the deformities associated with microcephaly or even of the difficulties faced by their mothers. And it certainly does not mean more efforts to police women’s behavior. To avoid infection, women have been advised to use mosquito repellent; remove standing water around their homes; wear long sleeves; and, if possible, use condoms or avoid sex. The US Center for Disease Control and Prevention advised pregnant women to refrain from traveling to affected countries. Most extreme, health officials in El Salvador and Colombia urged women not to get pregnant until 2018. Such recommendations, however well intended they may be, are fundamentally flawed. For starters, they emphasize short-term-vector control and surveillance, while delinking the disease from the social and structural determinants of health, including public infrastructure such as running water, proper sanitation, and access to care. They also place the responsibility for avoiding disease and pregnancy primarily on women, while failing to recognize the lack of control many women have over their bodies and pregnancies. Many of the areas affected by Zika have high rates of sexual violence and teen pregnancy, a lack of sex education, and inadequate access to contraceptives. For these reasons, more than 50% of pregnancies in Latin America are unintended. Making matters worse, in most Latin American countries affected by Zika, abortion is illegal, or permitted only in exceptional situations. For example, in El Salvador, where more than 7,000 cases of Zika were reported between December 2015 and January 2016, abortions are illegal under all circumstances. Miscarriages, if proven to be self-induced, can even lead to homicide convictions. The position of the United States hasn’t helped, either. Last year, US President Barack Obama’s administration asked Congress for $1.8 billion in emergency funding to help prepare for and respond to the Zika threat. But abortion politics intervened, as Republican lawmakers, leading a congressional hearing on the Zika outbreak, made the funding conditional on anti-abortion policies in recipient countries. The problems with the dominant approach to containing the Zika virus – namely, that it saddles women with too much responsibility while giving them too little power – are not lost on everyone. Last year, the United Nations Refugee Agency and the World Health Organization emphasized the need to put human rights at the center of the response to the Zika outbreak. But, while high-level recognition of women’s sexual and reproductive rights is a positive step, it is far from sufficient. And doing what is needed to protect those rights, particularly among poor and vulnerable women in developing countries, will require deep and sustained political commitment. In particular, national legislation must be revised to ensure that all women – whether they are carrying a baby with microcephaly or not – have full reproductive autonomy. Women must be able to base their reproductive choices on their own physical and emotional needs and desires, not on the moral judgments of powerful agents or risk of criminal sanctions. Advocacy groups in Brazil, for example, are already pushing for such an outcome, submitting legal cases to the Supreme Court to secure greater reproductive rights for women, including the right to safe and legal abortion. Those cases tend to lean on the 1988 National Constitution, which guarantees the right to abortion in case of rape, danger to the mother’s life, or anencephaly, another birth defect involving the brain. In pursuing these changes, campaigns should also recognize and address the links between women’s and disability rights. Indeed, they should advance equality for all marginalized groups. Zika’s medium- and long-term consequences must be addressed with this in mind. When a woman gives birth to a child with a congenital syndrome deriving from the Zika virus, the response should be grounded in the dignity, value, and rights of each individual. It should acknowledge the processes that keep certain individuals and groups in poverty and that deny them the basic rights of citizens. That is why campaigners must insist that the state be responsible for providing appropriate care and support services for each woman and child – services that both meet their needs and respect their rights.",
            "寨卡的不公平 南安普顿—从卫生角度讲，发展中世界传染病爆发已经足够糟糕了。 但它们还给社会公平带来了严重后果，因为它们加剧了存在已久的人道危机，包括恶化已经非常孱弱的公共服务供给和深化不平等性。 和2014年西非埃博拉爆发一样，2015年寨卡在中南美洲的爆发，首当其冲的也是社会弱势群体 — — 妇女和儿童、少数民族以及穷人。 和黄热病、登革热和其他疾病一样，寨卡由埃及伊蚊传播。 但和通常的蚊子传播的病毒不同，寨卡病毒还能通过性途径传播。 更加反常的是，它还能影响婴儿的神经系统和发育状况，导致小头症和格林-巴利综合症。 若非如此，寨卡所引起的症状通常没有什么大碍。 这意味着，在自寨卡爆发以来受其传染的150多万人中，育龄妇女的后果令人担心，特别是已经怀孕的妇女。 2016—2017年间，共有11,059 例寨卡病例为孕妇，她们的婴儿因此出现了10,867例小头症和其他中枢神经系统先天畸形。 在这些婴儿中，有百分之六十五的母亲是穷人或有色人种，生活在巴西东北部。 显然，寨卡危机不是性别中性的。 要解决它的中长期影响，就必须以妇女特别是贫穷妇女为焦点。 这并不意味着媒体更多地报道与小头症有关的畸形甚至这些婴儿的母亲面临的困难。 这也绝非意味着采取更多措施监控妇女的行为。 为了避免传染，妇女们常常被建议驱蚊剂、移除住处周边的死水、穿长袖衣裤，以及，如有可能，尽量使用避孕套或避免性生活。 美国疾病控制和预防中心建议孕妇不要去受影响国家旅行。 更极端地，萨尔瓦多和哥伦比亚卫生官员要求妇女在2018年前不要怀孕。 不管这些建议的初衷多么良好，都存在根本性错误。 首先，它们强调短期的控制和监控，而没有将这种疾病和决定健康的社会和结构性因素联系起来，包括自来水、卫生设施和全民医疗等公共基础设施。 它们还把避免疾病和怀孕的主要责任推卸给妇女，而没有认识到许多妇女根本没有办法控制自己的怀孕和性生活。 许多受寨卡疫情影响的地区，性暴力和少女怀孕比例很高，性教育和避孕手段也不充分。 出于这些原因，拉丁美洲50%以上的怀孕都属于以外情况。 更糟糕的是，在大部分受寨卡疫情影响的拉美国家，堕胎是非法行为，或只在特殊情况下才能允许。 比如，萨尔瓦多在2015年12月到2016年1月间报告了7,000多例寨卡病例，但堕胎在这个国家是绝对禁止的。 甚至因自身原因造成的早产也被视为杀人。 美国的立场也起不到帮助。 去年，美国总统奥巴马政府要求国会紧急拨款18亿美元用于帮助准备和响应寨卡威胁。 但堕胎政治干预 — — 共和党立法者领衔要求就寨卡疫情爆发进行国会听证 — — 导致拨款需要以受助国有反堕胎政策为条件。 遏制寨卡病毒的主要方法的问题在于它们给了妇女太多的责任和太少的权力。 并不是所有人都对此无动于衷。 去年，联合国难民署和世界卫生组织强调，必须将人权放在应对寨卡疫情爆发措施的核心。 但是，尽管高屋建瓴地承认妇女的性和生殖权利是一个积极的举措，但还远远不够。 而要保护这些权利，特别是发展中国家的贫穷的弱势妇女的权利，我们需要深刻的重大政治承诺。 特别是，国家立法必须进行修订，以保证所有妇女 — — 不管她们的胎儿是否存在小头症 — — 都获得充分的生殖自主权。 妇女必须能够以自身身体和精神需要和渴望为基础，而不是以权力机构的道德审判和刑事制裁的风险为基础，来做出她们的生殖选择。 比如，巴西的游说团体已经在推动这一结果，向最高法院递交了诉状，要求保证妇女更大的生殖权利，包括安全合法地堕胎的权利。 这些诉状倾向于1988年国家宪法，其中授予妇女在遭遇强奸、面临自身生命危险或无脑畸形（另外一种关于大脑有关的缺陷）等情况时有权利选择堕胎。 在追求这些变革目标的过程中，支持者应该认清并解决妇女和残疾权利之间的联系。 事实上，他们应该推动所有边缘群体获得平等权利。 寨卡的中长期后果比依靠这样的思路来解决。 当妇女生下因为寨卡病毒而存在先天性疾病的儿童时，其应对手段应该基于尊严、价值观和个体权利。 应该认识到，现在的程序让一些个体和群体陷入了贫困，剥夺了他们的基本公民权利。 因此，我的支持者必须坚持，国家要负责为每位妇女和儿童提供合适的医疗和支持服务 — — 这些服务既要满足他们的需要，也要尊重他们的权利。"

            "Zimbabwe’s Outlaw Regime PARIS – On July 20, the Zimbabwean authorities arrested the internationally renowned investigative journalist Hopewell Chin’ono and charged him with “incitement to participate in public violence.” But Chin’ono’s real crime was to expose – in collaboration with Mduduzi Mathuthu, another journalist now facing arrest – alleged procurement fraud at the health ministry involving COVID-19 medical supplies. Chin’ono’s revelations led a reluctant Emmerson Mnangagwa, the country’s president, to eventually fire health minister Obadiah Moyo. But whereas Moyo was granted bail following his arrest, Chin’ono remains in detention awaiting trial. After Chin’ono was arrested, Magistrate Judith Taruvinga signed an overly broad warrant allowing the authorities to search his home for “illegal documents and other articles kept at the house.” About 30 armed police, brandishing an additional warrant, later raided Chin’ono’s home and seized his camera. By contrast, Moyo was subject to no such raids or searches. By arresting a prominent corruption-busting reporter, the Zimbabwean government has once again demonstrated its intention to use the law as a political weapon to criminalize journalism. Finally, the international community is seeing behind Mnangagwa’s lofty rhetoric and recognizing the true nature of his regime. For all his attempts to burnish his government’s international image, Mnangagwa is simply following the authoritarian playbook of his longtime predecessor, Robert Mugabe. This should come as no surprise: Mnangagwa had been Mugabe’s special security assistant for 40 years before becoming president following the 2017 military coup that deposed his mentor. When Mnangagwa began what he unabashedly calls his “reign,” an international community exhausted by Mugabe’s villainy was hankering for rapprochement and partnership. Investors envisaged a new era in which the authorities would implement predictable rules, clean up pervasive corruption, and rein in rent-seeking officialdom. Mnangagwa played along, declaring that Zimbabwe was “open for business.” Just over two years later, however, Mnangagwa’s pretense has fallen apart. Matching Mugabe’s cruelty and entitlement, but lacking his erstwhile patron’s eloquence and intelligence, Mnangagwa has revealed himself to be a clueless buffoon with a cartoonish sense of his own invincibility. The world can now see clearly what was always obvious to discerning Zimbabweans: the 2017 coup was no act of self-renewal by the ruling ZANU-PF party, but rather stemmed from the impatience of a political heir eager for his own turn to maim, steal, and kill. After all, how can the regime claim to be open for business following its treatment of Chin’ono, whose exposé alleged that Mnangagwa’s son was connected to the procurement scandal? What “second republic” and “new dispensation” bombast can still sound meaningful after government security agents’ recent abduction and sexual assault of three young female opposition leaders, who were then arrested for supposedly faking the episode? What posturing about political reforms can be sustained when the regime, continuing where Mugabe left off, has gunned down peaceful demonstrators, manipulated elections, and committed torture and other crimes under international law? The regime knows that charging Chin’ono with inciting public violence is legal hot air, so it is punishing him through pretrial travesties. As Amnesty International’s Deprose Muchena has observed, Chin’ono’s arrest and detention are part of a broader attempt by the Zimbabwean authorities to persecute the regime’s critics. Recently, for example, Zimbabwe’s chief justice issued judges with a directive requiring that their judgments be “seen and approved” by their superiors before being issued – a patently unconstitutional instruction, given that judges must be independent. Although the chief justice dropped the word “approved” the following day, and later, following an outcry, seemed to withdraw the entire directive, the purpose remains clear. In addition, human-rights lawyers have recently been arrested on spurious charges. Meanwhile, Zimbabwe’s woes continue to multiply. Alex Magaisa, a lawyer, recently described how extensive official looting of a state-run agricultural support scheme had resulted in massive public debt. This followed earlier revelations by the opposition MP Tendai Biti that billions of dollars had been diverted from a separate “command agriculture” program. With nurses striking in a collapsed health-care system, and parts of the country’s hungry population calling for mass protests, the regime is in full panic mode. The arrest on July 31 of several peaceful protesters, including internationally renowned writer Tsitsi Dangarembga and student Panashe Sivindani, rounded off a month of citizen discontent, during which Mnangagwa also announced stricter COVID-19 lockdown measures for an indefinite period. Even in a context of rising infections, the draconian rules prompted the United Nations to express concern about a possible authoritarian clampdown. The new directives impose a curfew from 6:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m., and require all “non-working” Zimbabweans to stay at home during the day – at a time when formal unemployment is above 90%. The Zimbabwean regime thrives on graft and lies. Mnangagwa uses the law and institutions of justice not as the testaments they should be to the ideals of belonging, fairness and dignity, but as carrots and knobkerries to wield as he sees fit. Such behavior has now created an environment of lawlessness and injustice that is causing responsible investors to think twice about putting their money in Zimbabwe. When a regime shoots itself in the foot, as the one in Harare is doing, the foreign investment that comes to the country is typically crudely extractive: blood contracts calculated to hollow out its natural resources in exchange for supporting its rulers with tanks, guns, and ammunition, other tools of political and social repression, and fat personal bank accounts.",
            "津巴布韦的非法政权 巴黎—7月20日，津巴布韦当局逮捕了国际知名的调查记者霍普维尔·钦奥诺，同时指控他“煽动参与公众暴乱 。 ” 但钦奥诺真正的罪行是与现在正面临被捕的另外一名记者马苏苏合作，揭露卫生部涉嫌在2019年新冠疫情医疗用品采购过程中所谓的欺诈行为。 钦奥诺所揭露的内幕导致津巴布韦总统埃莫森·穆南加格瓦最终解雇了卫生部长奥巴迪亚·莫约，尽管他在这么做的时候并不情愿，但莫约在被捕后即被批准保释，而钦奥诺在等待审判期间却仍然被关押在狱中。 钦奥诺被捕后，地方法院法官朱迪斯·塔鲁温加签署了一份过于宽泛的逮捕令，授权当局对其“家中存放的任何非法文件和其他物品”进行搜查。 之后，约有30名武装警察挥舞着另一份搜查令，对钦奥诺的住所进行了突袭并没收了他的相机。 相比之下，莫约却没有遭到此类突袭或搜查。 通过逮捕一位著名的反腐记者，津巴布韦政府再次证明了其将法律用作政治武器打击新闻报道的企图。 最终，国际社会看穿了穆南加格瓦的夸夸其谈，真正认清了其政权的真实本性是什么。 尽管表面竭尽全力试图改善政府的国际形象，但穆南加格瓦不过是在仿效其长期执政的前任罗伯特·穆加贝的专制戏码。 这其实不足为奇：穆南加格瓦在2017年军事政变推翻其导师之前，在长达40年的时间里一直担任穆加贝的特别安全助理职务。 在穆南加格瓦开始其毫不掩饰地对外宣称自己的“统治”时，被穆加贝的恶行搞得筋疲力竭的国际社会十分渴望关系和解与合作。 投资者梦想拥有一个当局执行规则可以预见的新时代，清理普遍存在的腐败现象，并同时控制官僚主义寻租。 穆南加格瓦假意顺应人们的意愿，公开宣布津巴布韦“启动开放进程 。 ” 但仅仅不到两年后，穆南加格瓦的伪装就已经无法维持了。 他的残忍和特权可以和穆加贝相提并论，但却缺乏其昔日雇主的智慧和雄辩的才华。 穆南加格瓦已经无法掩饰自己是一名愚蠢的小丑，其不可战胜的意识充满了卡通化。 现在，世界可以清晰地看到对明察秋毫的津巴布韦人一直就显而易见的事实：2017年政变不是执政的爱国阵线党（ ZANU-PF）试图进行自我更新，而是因为一位政治继承人迫不及待地想要把伤害、偷窃和杀戮的权力抢夺到自己手中。 毕竟，在钦奥诺遭受如此对待后，津巴布韦政府怎么能声称对外开放，钦奥诺的揭露文章指控穆南加格瓦的儿子被卷入到这起采购丑闻之中？ 在政府安全人员不久前绑架和性侵三位年轻的女性反对派领袖并在其后以所谓编造事实对她们进行逮捕后，所谓“第二共和国”和“新政权”的夸夸其谈还有什么可信之处？ 当现政权继承穆加贝的衣钵、枪击和平示威者、 操纵选举和公然违反国际法犯下酷刑和其他罪行时，还装模作样地进行什么政治改革？ 穆南加格瓦政权知道指控钦奥诺煽动公众暴乱在法律上站不住脚，因此正试图通过庭审前的荒诞闹剧对其进行惩罚。 就像国际特赦组织的德普罗斯·穆切纳所观察到的那样，钦奥诺的逮捕和拘押部分构成了津巴布韦当局迫害政权批评者的更大范围的图谋。 例如，最近，津巴布韦首席大法官颁布了一项指令，要求法官在下达判决前必须得到其上级的“审阅和批准 ” — —这项指令公然违反宪法，因为法官必须具有独立性。 尽管首席大法官第二天去掉了“批准”一词，而后又在引发强烈抗议后貌似撤回了整个指令，但其目的依然非常明确。 此外，近来还以虚假指控逮捕了部分人权律师。 与此同时，津巴布韦的灾难则愈演愈烈。 律师亚力克斯·马格萨最近详细阐述了官方对国营农业支持计划的大范围掠夺究竟如何导致大规模公共债务。 此前，反对派议员腾达伊·比提也曾透露，从一项单独的“指令农业”计划中已经有数十亿美元被挪用。 随着医疗体系崩溃以及护士罢工，以及该国部分饥饿人口呼吁举行大规模抗议活动，津巴布韦政权现在已彻底陷入恐慌状态。 7月31日，包括国际知名作家特西提·丹格瑞姆加和学生帕纳希·西文达尼等几名和平示威者被捕结束了长达一个月的民众不满，在此期间，穆南加格瓦还宣布无限期实行更严格的2019年新冠疫情封锁举措。 即使在感染率不断攀升的情况下，严厉的规则也促使联合国表达了对可能的威权主义镇压的担忧。 新禁令要求从下午6点到凌晨6点期间实行宵禁，并要求所有“不工作的”津巴布韦人在白天待在户内 — — 而此时，正式失业率超过90%之多。 津巴布韦政府贪腐盛行而且满嘴谎言。 穆南加格瓦从未用法律和司法机构来证明归属感、公平和尊严等理想，反而随心所欲地将其作为胡萝卜和大棒等贿赂和惩戒手段。 目前，此种行为已经制造了无法无天和不公平的环境，从而导致负责任的投资者对投资津巴布韦裹足不前。 当某个政权搬起石头砸自己的脚，就像哈拉雷的现政权所做的那样，流入该国的外资往往秉承捞一把就走的心态：经过精心计算的血汗合同旨在挖空这个国家的自然资源，以换取用坦克、枪支、弹药、其他政治和社会镇压工具以及利润丰厚的个人银行账户支持该国的执政党派。"

            "Zimbabwe Needs Its Own Cryptocurrency ADDIS ABABA – When Zimbabwe’s President Robert Mugabe was deposed in November 2017, after 30 years in power, many hoped that the economic decline he had overseen would soon be reversed. But, a year and a half later, the economy is showing no signs of recovering, thanks to an ongoing currency crisis. Could a blockchain-based cryptocurrency be the cure for what ails Zimbabwe? Just over a decade ago, Zimbabwe was beset by such severe hyperinflation – which peaked at 89.7 sextillion percent in November 2008 – that it abandoned its currency altogether, adopting instead a basket of international currencies, led by the US dollar. But acute dollar shortages drove up prices, spurring the government, in 2016, to introduce its own banknotes and coins that were supposedly worth the same as US dollars. Due to lack of confidence, however, the new money traded at a significant discount on the black market. With dollars continuing to flow out of the country at a faster rate than they flowed in, the government recently merged its currency and all electronic money into yet another new unit: the Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) dollar. But simply issuing another currency will not be enough to solve Zimbabwe’s problem. A “fiat” currency – whose value is not intrinsic, but established by the government – is viewed as credible only when the government prints money responsibly and most money in the country is held in the banking system. When the system’s credibility collapses, it takes decades to rebuild. That is what has happened in Zimbabwe, where the government has a long history of poor fiscal management. In 2003, for example, the government was routinely withdrawing money from privately held foreign-currency-denominated accounts without the account holders’ consent; meanwhile, it couldn’t afford the ink needed to print more bank notes. Their confidence shaken by years of politically motivated monetary interventions, including unrestrained money-printing to fund discretionary spending, Zimbabweans have long avoided holding currency issued by their own government. In 2008, money was changing hands over a hundred times faster in Zimbabwe than elsewhere in Sub-Saharan Africa, as people sought more trustworthy stores of value. This lack of consumer and business confidence in a state-run monetary system continues to this day. The RTGS dollar lost one-fifth of its value within a month of its introduction. None of this should be surprising. When people lose their life savings and are plunged into poverty through no fault of their own, the last thing they want to do is rely on the government that put them there and, amid shrinking tax revenues, offers them little support in getting back on their feet. A blockchain-based cryptocurrency would circumvent this lack of confidence. Rather than being managed by the central bank, transactions would be stored on a distributed, decentralized public ledger. And, as with Bitcoin, the supply would be capped, in order to prevent the discretionary printing of money. In this sense, a cryptocurrency would resolve the two most fundamental problems with a state-run monetary system in Zimbabwe. The benefits would be far-reaching. Blockchain technology makes transactions virtually tamper-proof. And, with third-party intermediation unnecessary, transactions costs are low. This could save the Zimbabwean diaspora up to $90 million annually in remittance-related fees. Lower transaction costs would also support progress on financial inclusion, as anyone with Internet access could trade even very small amounts of money in real time. With the expansion of Internet-enabled mobile-phone use, even those living in isolated regions have gained valuable opportunities to participate in the formal banking system. According to the United Nations, this trend has already brought millions into the formal economy in Asia. The next step would be for Zimbabwe to start using self-executing “smart contracts” in its formal economy – a change that could save up to 0.5% of Zimbabwe’s annual GDP. This approach would boost business confidence, by making transactions safer and cheaper. Such a shift could be extended to many other applications: for example, blockchain technology could enable the instant digital transfer of asset titles. The ultimate goal would be to create an open banking system – a more transparent model, in which banking data are shared through open application programming interfaces, enabling third-party developers to build their own applications and services. Given Zimbabweans’ lack of faith in their existing system, it would not take much to convince them to leave it behind. As a blockchain-based system strengthened business and consumer confidence, investment and household spending would rise, bolstering the economy and boosting tax revenues. This, together with the government’s inability to engage in discretionary money-printing, would vastly improve the management of public finances, helping the government to recover its credibility in the long term. But the lynchpin of this system is the fact that it will function, even while the government remains discredited.",
            "津巴布韦需要自己的加密货币 发自亚的斯亚贝巴—当执政30年的津巴布韦前总统罗伯特·穆加贝于2017年11月被废黜后，许多人都期望他治下的经济衰退状况能很快得到逆转。 可如今时间已经过去了一年半有余，该国经济却依然在一场持续爆发的货币危机影响下一蹶不振。 那么一种基于区块链技术的加密货币有可能解决困扰津巴布韦的问题吗？ 就在十多年前，津巴布韦也遭受过类似的严重恶性通货膨胀的困扰 — — 最终在2008年11月达到了89700000000000000000000％的顶峰 — — 致使其完全放弃了本国货币，转而采用以美元为首的一篮子国际货币。 但严重的美元短缺又推高了物价，促使政府在2016年再次推出了据称与美元等值的纸币和硬币。 然而由于民众对新货币缺乏信任，导致新钞在黑市上大幅折价。 随着美元继续以净流出的态势不断外流，政府最近将其货币和所有电子货币合并为另一个新货币单位：实时全额结算（Real Time Gross Settlement）元。 但仅仅发行另一种货币并不足以解决津巴布韦的问题。 任何一种“法定”货币 — — 其价值并非内生，而是由政府确立的 — — 都只有在政府负责任地印钞且该国大部分货币都存放在银行系统中时才会被视为可信的。 而一旦货币体系的可信度崩溃，重建起来就需要数十年时间。 这也是政府财政长年管理不善的津巴布韦所面临的情况。 比如在2003年时，政府经常会在未经账户持有人同意的情况下从私人持有的外币账户中提取资金；同时又连打印更多钞票所需的墨水钱都拿不出来。 在经历了多年基于政治动机的货币干预措施，包括为支付任意开支而无限制的印钞后，民众的信心受到动摇，以至于长期以来都尽可能避免持有本国政府发行的货币。 2008年津巴布韦的货币转手速度要比撒哈拉以南非洲国家快一百倍，因为人们急于寻找更值得信赖的价值储存方式。 消费者和企业对国有货币体系的信心危机至今仍在延续，正如实时全额结算元在推出后的一个月内就跌掉了1/5的价值。 这一切都是意料之外。 当人们无缘无故地失去了自己的一生储蓄并陷入贫困时，他们显然不会再想去依靠那个让他们落入这般困境（同时又因税收收入减少而无法帮助他们重新立足）的政府。 对此一种基于区块链的加密货币可以摆脱这种缺乏信心的状况。 交易不再由中央银行管理，而是被存储一个在分布式且去中心化的公共分类账上。 同时与比特币一样，货币供应将受到限制以避免随意印钞。 在这个意义上加密货币将解决津巴布韦国有货币体系中的两个最基本问题。 因此产生的好处也是极为深远的。 区块链技术使交易几乎无法被篡改。 而且因为消灭了第三方中介，交易成本可以很低。 这可以为津巴布韦侨民每年节省高达9000万美元的汇款相关费用。 较低的交易成本也可以支持在金融包容性方面的进展，因为任何可以连上互联网的人都可以实时交易非常少量的资金。 随着互联网手机使用的扩大，即使是那些生活在偏远地区的人也获得了加入正式银行体系的宝贵机会。 根据联合国的报告，这一趋势在亚洲已经成功将数百万人纳入到了正规经济体系中。 下一步则是开始在津巴布韦的正规经济中启用自动执行的“智能合约 ” — —这一变化所省下的金额可以相当于津巴布韦年度GDP的0.5 ％ 。 通过使交易更安全、更便宜，这种方法可以提高商业信心，还可以扩展到许多其他应用：比如区块链技术就可以实现资产所有权的即时数字转移。 而最终目标则是创建一个开放的银行系统 — — 也就是一个更透明的模型，通过开放式应用程序编程接口来共享银行数据，使得第三方开发者得以构建自己的应用程序和服务。 鉴于津巴布韦人对现有制度缺乏信心，说服他们破旧立新也不会太难。 由于基于区块链的系统增强了商业和消费者的信心，投资和家庭支出也会因此增加，从而支撑经济并增加税收收入。 这将与政府无法任意支配的印钞机制一道极大改善公共财政管理，帮助政府在长期范围内恢复自身信誉。 但这个系统的关键其实在于即便在政府名誉扫地的情况下也照样能发挥作用。"

            "How People Power Strengthens the Rule of Law HARARE – On a cold winter’s night in July 2016, thousands of people gathered inside and outside Rotten Row Magistrates’ Court in Harare to await the verdict in the Zimbabwean government’s case against Pastor Evan Mawarire, the leader of the #ThisFlag movement and a staunch opponent of then-President Robert Mugabe. When the magistrate eventually threw out the treason charges brought against Mawarire for peacefully rallying people against corruption, a street party broke out. It was an unexpected victory for the rule of law – won, at least in part, through collective non-violent action by ordinary people. In its most basic form, the rule of law simply means that no one is above the law. Everyone is treated fairly and justly, and the government does not exercise its power arbitrarily. These principles lie at the heart of the ongoing protests against systemic racism and police brutality in the United States following the death of George Floyd. The rule of law is very different from rule by law, which characterizes many authoritarian states and, increasingly, some democracies as well. Many argue, not unreasonably, that building robust institutions is essential to strengthening the rule of law. But what do you do when the institutions which are meant to uphold the rule of law are so hollowed out that they have become the primary tools for its subversion? The conventional focus on “building institutions” can leave ordinary people feeling disempowered, waiting patiently for the all-important institutions to reform, while they remain on the receiving end of oppression meted out by those very institutions. It can also lead to unhelpful interventions by well-meaning external actors, which inadvertently strengthen the authoritarian capabilities of captured institutions, rather than the rule of law. To strengthen the rule of law, we first need to focus on strengthening people, not institutions. This involves the difficult, dangerous, and often unglamorous work of grassroots community organizing that empowers citizens to act through informal channels outside of established institutions. Such action includes non-violent protests – marches, boycotts, strikes, and pickets – as well as community initiatives that directly improve people’s lives, such as worker advice centers and community gardens. Such efforts are especially necessary in authoritarian states where institutions are fundamentally broken. But even in established democracies, the recent failure of supposedly strong institutions to prevent the rule of law from being undermined has shown that there is no substitute for an active and organized citizenry. Such engagement cannot be legislated or decreed, or copied and pasted from another jurisdiction. People must build it collectively from the ground up. Building people power starts with opening citizens’ minds to a different type of society and a new way of doing things. In apartheid South Africa, for example, the study groups and adult literacy classes in townships during the 1970s helped to lay the groundwork for the mass movement that emerged in the 1980s under the banner of the United Democratic Front. The UDF would go on to play a leading role in the struggle against apartheid, culminating in 1990 with Nelson Mandela’s release from prison and the unbanning of the African National Congress. Next, like-minded people need to organize themselves, connect with one another in the real world (not just on social media), and become actively involved in issues directly affecting their lives. These issues might at first be local rather than national, and involve less risky actions. Over time, however, people build mutual trust and gain confidence in both themselves and their collective power as a group. Coalitions form, and actions become larger in scope and perhaps more confrontational. Before you know it, a social movement emerges that is bigger than any of the individuals or organizations involved and can unlock people’s power to bring about change. People power can strengthen the rule of law in at least three ways. For starters, it can counteract and even neutralize the top-down pressure placed on courts and police by the authorities – typically, the executive. This can help to ensure that even hollowed-out or compromised institutions discharge their duties in accordance with the rule of law – as in the case involving Mawarire. Second, a people-power movement can create alternative spaces that prefigure a society in which the rule of law is respected. The movement must operate internally in a just and fair way, and apply the same standards to all its members regardless of rank. And any civil disobedience must have a strategic purpose and be highly disciplined, so that participants understand that such action does not constitute a rejection of the rule of law, but rather a means of establishing it. Third, people power has repeatedly proved to be an effective tool in defeating even the most brutal dictatorships and achieving a transition to a more democratic system of governance. Far-reaching reforms that strengthen the rule of law can then be implemented in ways that would not have been possible under a corrupted system. In November 2019, for example, Sudan’s new transitional authority – established after months of non-violent protests against President Omar al-Bashir’s dictatorship and then against the military regime that ousted him – repealed an oppressive public-order law that had governed how women could behave and dress in public. Although Sudan’s transition is by no means complete, this represented a huge triumph for the rule of law. It would not have been achieved without people power. Authoritarian leaders understand and fear people power. Soon after Mawarire’s hearing, the Zimbabwean regime erected a fence around Rotten Row Magistrates’ Court to prevent similar public gatherings there in the future. But just as authoritarian regimes adapt and learn from their past mistakes, those of us fighting for a society based on the rule of law also must adjust, innovate, and improvise, and accumulate enough power to dismantle the oppressive systems that shackle us.

            "人民权力如何增强法治 哈拉雷—在2016年7月一个寒冷的冬夜，数千人聚集在哈拉雷跑马道地方法院内外，等候津巴布韦政府对#ThisFlag运动领袖，时任总统罗伯特·穆加贝坚定的反对者埃文·马瓦雷里牧师所作出的判决。 当地方法官最终推翻对马瓦雷里和平集结民众反对腐败的叛国指控时，瞬间引爆了一场街头派对。 这次法治的胜利出乎意料 — — 赢得这场胜利至少部分因为普通民众的集体非暴力行为。 法治最基本的形式仅仅意味着没有人能够超越法律。 人人都能得到公平公正的对待，而政府也不能任意行使权力。 上述原则是乔治·弗洛伊德死后美国持续抗议系统性种族主义和警察暴行的核心。 法治与以法治国差异甚大，后者是许多独裁国家和越来越多民主国家的特征。 许多人的观点并非毫无道理，那就是建立健全的制度是强化法治的核心。 但应当怎么做才能应对有人掏空本来旨在维护法治的机构，使之成为颠覆法治的主要工具？ 传统上对“机构建设”的关注会让普通民众感到无能为力，只能耐心等待重要机构进行改革，同时仍被动承受这些机构所给予的压力。 这还可能引发善意外部主体无益的干预，从而在无意间强化了被俘机构，而非法治的威权能力。 为强化法治，我们首先需要强化民众，而非体制。 这涉及基层社会团体某些艰巨、危险、而且往往不甚光彩的工作，这些工作授权公民通过既有机构以外的非正式渠道采取行动。 此类行动包括非暴力抗议活动（游行、抵制、罢工和纠察 ） ， 以及劳动者咨询中心和社区花园等直接改善民众生活的社会举措。 这样的努力在体制彻底崩溃的威权国家尤为必要。 但即使在根深蒂固的民主国家，被认为强大的体制最近未能阻止法治遭到破坏已经表明没有什么能够取代积极有序的民众组织。 这样的机制不能依赖章程和法规，也不能从其他辖区复制和粘贴。 民众必须从一开始就集体参与。 赋予民众力量始于向不同类型的社会开放民众思想，并让民众接受新的做事方式。 例如，在实行种族隔离制度的南非，20世纪70年代遍布南非乡镇的研究团体和成人扫盲班为20世纪80年代联合民主阵线旗帜下兴起的群众运动奠定了基础。 联合民主阵线之后继续在反对种族隔离的斗争发挥领导作用，高潮是20世纪90年代纳尔逊·曼德拉出狱以及非国大解禁。 随后，志趣相投的民众需要组织起来，在现实世界中（而不仅仅是社交媒体上）建立相互联系，并积极参与直接影响他们生活的主题。 这些问题可能起初具有地方性而非全国性，涉及危险性较小的行动。 但随着时间的推移，人们建立了相互信任，并且对自身和作为团体的集体力量建立了信心。 联盟因此形成，同时行动范围扩大，也许更具对抗性。 不知不觉中，诞生了规模超过其中任何个人或组织、并能释放民众力量推动变革的一项社会运动。 民众力量可以通过至少三种方式来强化法治。 首先，它可以抵消甚至中和政府 — — 通常是行政机构 — — 施加在法院和警察身上的自上而下的压力。 它能够帮助哪怕是被掏空或者攻陷的机构按照法治精神来履行职责，类似的例子就是马瓦雷里案的审理。 其次，人民力量运动可以创造出替代空间，从而预示着尊重法治的社会。 运动内部运作必须秉持公平、公正的精神，并无论等级对所有成员采取一视同仁的标准。 同时任何公民抗命都必须拥有战略目标，而且要受到严格的纪律处分，因为只有这样才能确保参与者理解上述行为并不是拒绝法治，反而有助于法治的建立。 第三，人民权力被反复证明是击败最残酷独裁政权并实现向更民主治理体制过渡的有效工具。 而后，就可以推行意义深远的强化法治的改革，而类似的改革在腐败制度下完全不可能。 例如，在2019年11月，苏丹新过渡政府 — — 该政府的成立在针对奥马尔·巴希尔总统独裁政权几个月的非暴力抗议事件后，而后又反对推翻巴希尔的军事政权 — — 废止了一项压迫性的公共秩序法，规定妇女在公共场合应当如何穿着和行为。 尽管苏丹的过渡还远远谈不上完整，但这依然代表着法治的巨大胜利。 没有人民力量实现这样的目标根本不可能。 威权领导人理解并惧怕人民权力。 就在马瓦雷里听证会之后，津巴布韦政府在跑马道地方法院周围竖起了防护网，以防止未来类似的公众集会在那里发生。 但就像专制政权不断适应并从过去的错误中吸取教训一样，我们这些按照法治精神为社会奋斗的人也必须调整、创新和即兴创作，积累足够的力量来打破束缚我们的压迫性制度。 只有通过普通民众的斗争，我们才能最终将注意力转移到建设平等保护所有人的强大机构。 作者以个人身份写作，本文所表达的观点仅属于他个人。"

            "The Environmental Consequences of Political Repression HARARE – Zimbabwe was once Africa’s rising star. Boasting robust human capital, considerable natural-resource wealth, and modern infrastructure, it was the continent’s leading producer of crops such as maize, wheat, and soybeans. Agricultural exports earned it the moniker “the breadbasket of Africa.” How far the country has fallen. Today, Zimbabwe can barely feed its own people, let alone the rest of the continent. According to the World Food Program, some 8.6 million Zimbabweans need help, and acute malnutrition is expected to rise by 15% in 2020, exacerbated by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, the government is failing to provide basic services, such as safe drinking water, health care, adequate housing, and education. Zimbabwe is also enduring one of the worst economic meltdowns in its history – and the second in a little over a decade. The country is now beset by runaway inflation, severe fuel shortages, prolonged power outages, and mounting unemployment. Some 90% of Zimbabweans now struggle to make their living in the informal sector. These problems began with severe economic mismanagement under Robert Mugabe, whose 37-year-long rule – which ended when the military forced him to resign in 2017 – was marked by severe, often violent political repression. But Mugabe’s successor, President Emmerson Mnangagwa, and the military junta that facilitated his rise to power have not brought much change. Not only have they done little to reform the economy and create conditions for investment and growth; they have also maintained Mugabe’s repressive practices. But it is not only Zimbabwe’s people who are suffering from the regime’s behavior. So is the environment. The Forestry Commission of Zimbabwe estimates that the country is losing 330,000 hectares of forestland per year, and that total forest and woodland cover has dropped from 53% to 45% since 2014. The primary reason for this decline is that Zimbabweans depend on biomass for nearly 70% of their energy, owing to the unavailability of electricity and the high cost of gas for cooking. Deforestation in Zimbabwe has contributed to the decrease in annual rainfall in the region over the last decade. (Air that passes over trees produces twice as much rain as air that does not.) Given Zimbabwe’s location in the tropics, which makes it particularly vulnerable to shifting rainfall patterns, this has contributed to recurrent droughts – a major driver of rising food insecurity. Reduced rainfall has also affected electricity generation, by forcing a partial shutdown of the hydroelectric plant on Lake Kariba in 2019, which supplies over 50% of Zimbabwe’s electricity, as well as electricity for Zambia. A shortage of foreign currency puts Zimbabwe’s alternative source of electricity – imports from Mozambique and South Africa – out of reach. In 2019, power outages lasting up to 18 hours became routine, disrupting economic activity. When it comes to delivering other services – such as managing urban waste and supplying potable water – the government’s failures seem intentional. Over the last 20 years, the opposition Movement for Democratic Change Alliance (MDC–A), led by Nelson Chamisa, has gained popularity, and now controls 26 out of 32 urban local governments. To assert its authority, the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union–Patriotic Front (ZANU–PF) – the party of Mugabe and Mnangagwa – has used its power to circumvent constitutional provisions that give residents and local authorities greater control of service delivery. The politicization of basic services has undermined their delivery significantly. Poor waste management allowed the capital city of Harare’s main water source, Lake Chivero, to become heavily polluted from sewage effluent, causing eutrophication (when nutrient buildup causes excessive vegetation growth). According to a recent report by the Harare City Council, water from Lake Chivero is now contaminated with substances linked to liver and central-nervous-system ailments. Harare’s main water-treatment facility, built with a capacity to serve 300,000 people, today supplies water to over 1.5 million, and is not nearly up to the task. The combination of inadequate waste management and a lack of potable water was responsible for the 2008 cholera outbreak, which claimed over 4,000 lives. Gold mining, a key economic activity since before colonialism, is furthering jeopardizing Zimbabweans’ health. But political uncertainty and an unfavorable business environment have weakened investment in the industry. So most mining, some 60%, is carried out illegally, with no regard for environmental or safety standards. The result has been increasing pollution in the Mazowe River, which flows from Zimbabwe into Mozambique, where the increasingly toxic water is used for household, recreational, and agricultural purposes. Enforcing environmental standards is not a priority for Zimbabwe’s government, because gold is a valuable source of foreign currency. According to Transparency International Zimbabwe, however, the country is losing over $200 million each year, as huge amounts of gold are sold on the black market and eventually smuggled out of the country to places like Dubai and South Africa. Zimbabwe embodies the nexus of political repression, poor governance, and environmental degradation. The effects are not bound by national borders, so this nexus should concern us all.",
            "政治压迫所产生的环境后果 哈拉雷—津巴布韦曾经是非洲的后起之秀。 因为拥有丰富的人力资本、可观的自然资源财富和现代化的基础设施，津巴布韦曾经是非洲大陆最主要的玉米、小麦和大豆出产国。 农产品出口为其赢得了“非洲粮仓”的美誉。 很难想象这个国家已经衰落到了何种程度。 今天，不要说养活非洲其他国家，津巴布韦几乎养不活其本国人口。 据世界粮食计划署统计，约860万津巴布韦民众需要帮助，而因为2019年新冠疫情的打击，2020年严重营养不良发生率预计将增加15 % 。 此外，政府根本无力提供安全饮水、医疗保健、充足的住房和教育等基本服务。 津巴布韦同时还经历着10多年来第2次经济危机，此次危机也是有史以来最严重的。 该国现在受到通胀失控、严重燃料短缺、长时间停电以及失业率飙升等问题的困扰。 现在，约90%的津巴布韦人想方设法在非正规行业寻找工作。 上述问题始于罗伯特·穆加贝执政时期严重的经济管理不善，此人长达37年的统治 — — 直到2017年军方逼迫他辞职才宣告结束 — — 以严重、且往往充满暴力色彩的政治镇压为特色。 但继任穆加贝的埃默森·姆南加格瓦总统以及协助他上台的军政府并没有带来多大变化。 他们不仅在改革经济、为投资和增长创造条件方面无所作为；而且还维系了穆加贝压迫性的做法。 但不仅是津巴布韦民众正在受到上述政权的困扰。 环境也是一样。 据津巴布韦林业委员会估计，该国每年都损失330,000公顷林地，而且自2014年来，森林和林地的总体覆盖率已经从53%下降到45 % 。 造成林地面积下降的主要原因是由于电力不足及烹饪用天然气成本居高不下，导致津巴布韦人仍依靠生物能源来满足近70%的能源需求。 过去10年来，津巴布韦的森林砍伐已经导致了该地区年降雨量的减少。 （流过森林的空气能带来高达两倍的降雨量。 ）因为地处热带的津巴布韦特别容易受到降雨模式改变的影响，于是导致反复出现干旱 — — 这也是粮食安全形势日趋严峻的主要驱动因素。 降雨量减少还因为2019年迫使卡里巴湖水电厂部分关闭而对发电造成了影响，该电厂生产了津巴布韦超过50%的电力，而且还将电力输送到赞比亚。 外汇短缺导致津巴布韦的替代电力来源 — — 从莫桑比克和南非进口 — — 不再成其为选项。 2019年，持续时间长达18小时以上的停电已成为家常便饭，从而严重破坏了经济活动。 在提供其他服务 — — 如城市垃圾管理和饮用水供应方面 — — 政府的失败似乎是有意的。 过去20年来，由纳尔逊·查米萨领导的反对派民主变革运动联盟（MDC-A）一直受到欢迎，现在掌控着32个地方政府中的26个。 为维护其自身权威，执政的津巴布韦非洲民族联盟爱国阵线（ZANU-PF ） — —也就是穆加贝和姆南加格瓦所在的政党 — — 一直动用权力来规避宪法条款，而恰恰是这些条款授权居民和地方政府能更好地控制提供服务。 基础服务政治化严重破坏了服务的提供。 废物管理不善导致首都哈拉雷的主要水源奇韦罗湖遭到污水排放的严重污染，从而导致水质富营养化（即累积起来的养分导致植被生长过度。 ）哈拉雷市议会最新报告显示，奇韦罗湖的水质已经被与肝脏和中枢神经系统疾病有关的物质所污染了。 哈拉雷的主要水处理厂可为 300,000人提供服务，但如今服务人数却高达150万以上，因此根本完不成任务。 缺乏废物管理和饮用水不足共同导致了2008年超过4，000人死亡的霍乱爆发。 先于殖民主义就已存在的重要经济活动金矿开采正在进一步危害津巴布韦人的健康。 但政治不确定性和不利的商业环境已经导致对该行业的投资减少。 因此占比约60%的绝大多数开采活动均为非法进行，因此视环境或安全标准为无物。 结果导致从津巴布韦流入莫桑比克的马祖威河（Mazowe River）污染日趋严重，毒性越来越大的河水被用于日常、娱乐和农业等用途。 执行环境标准并非津巴布韦政府的优先关注，因为黄金能够带来宝贵的外汇。 但据津巴布韦透明国际组织统计，因为大量黄金流入黑市并最终被走私到迪拜和南非等地，该国每年损失超过2亿美元的财富。 津巴布韦恰恰体现了如影随形的政治压迫、治理不善和环境恶化。 由此造成的影响不受国界限制，因此应当引起我们所有人的关注。"

            "Zimbabwe's Last Chance As the world rooted for former United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan in his recent efforts to end the violence in Kenya, many also found themselves wondering whether a weary Annan, or some other global leader, will be battling another fire by the end of this month: this time in Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe’s upcoming elections, scheduled for March 29, offer both fear and hope to the millions trapped in or trying to escape the country’s hellish conditions. Even official data now put the inflation rate at more than 100,000%, and the plight of ordinary Zimbabweans grows more desperate by the day. The elections could bring Zimbabweans a chance to end the long dictatorship of President Robert Mugabe. But, without supervision, they will be held in an environment that could dash Zimbabweans’ hopes. Zimbabweans are denied their basic freedoms and subjected to violence. Torture is widespread. Civil society groups report the arrests of opposition electoral candidates, the manipulation of food supplies for political purposes, and violent incidents of voter intimidation. The Zimbabwe Election Support Network has also expressed concern about the country’s state of readiness for this complex election, which will combine presidential, parliamentary, senatorial, and local government contests. And this is to say nothing of the structural faults that continue to impede political progress – a defective constitution, censored media, and a partisan security and military establishment. It didn’t have to be this way. This past year has seen one missed opportunity after another. South African president Thabo Mbeki convened negotiations with Zimbabwe’s political groups; but they have been so unfruitful that opposition leaders recently all but accused Mbeki of lying to the world about the progress of the talks. Some African leaders – notably Ghana’s president, John Kufuor, and outgoing African Union head Alpha Konare – have tried to cajole Mugabe towards reform, to no avail. Perhaps more significantly, the international community’s failure to address Zimbabwe seriously shows, once again, that it lacks the political will to prevent foreseeable crises. Last year, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Louise Arbour condemned the regime’s use of torture and its mistreatment of pro-democracy forces. Regrettably, the UN failed to follow up with institutional action. The UN would say it must be invited into a country before it can take certain forms of action, such as sending official election observers. But it is also true that with adequate political will, the UN Security Council could live up to its responsibility to Zimbabweans by responding to the crisis more aggressively. The UN should have put Mugabe on the defensive with a forceful public offer to help Zimbabwe prepare for internationally supervised elections. Instead, the UN continues to defer to Mugabe, who hides behind claims of sovereignty while jailing a defenseless populace. With so many lives at stake, what can be done to avert an intensification of the Zimbabwe crisis? People of good will throughout the world, including those affiliated with multilateral organizations like the UN, should descend on Zimbabwe to observe this month’s elections. Accredited or not, they should stand in solidarity with the people of Zimbabwe at this crucial moment, act as witnesses to the deteriorating pre-election environment, and serve as a bulwark against any escalation of state brutality during and after the vote. Mugabe would prefer to limit the presence of international observers to those sent by neighboring states – the same allies that somehow managed to deem the violent and fraudulent elections of the past seven years “legitimate.” Zimbabwe’s neighbors also face a choice: they can use their proximity to halt Mugabe’s abuses, or to shield him from international scrutiny and rebuke. Their choice may depend on what the world demands of them. The people of Zimbabwe will play their part on March 29. As for the regional and world community, their actions today and in the coming weeks could make the difference between a reprise of the violence in Kenya and the first step towards a more stable and democratic future.",
            "津巴布韦的最后机会 尽管全世界都大力支持联合国前秘书长安南最近为结束肯尼亚的暴乱而进行的努力，但是许多人还是不禁会疑问疲倦的安南或者另一位世界领导人能够扑灭这个月底将会发生的另一场大火吗？ 这一次是在津巴布韦。 津巴布韦将于3月29日举行的大选给数百万深陷于或者试图逃脱这个国家可怕的环境的人们既带来了担忧，也带来了希望。 即便根据官方的数据，那里的通货膨胀率也超过了100000 % ， 而普通的津巴布韦人所面临的困境正在日益加剧。 大选可以使津巴布韦人有机会终结穆加贝长期的独裁统治。 但是在没有监督的情况下，津巴布韦人的希望很有可能会破灭。 津巴布韦人被剥夺了基本的自由，并且受到暴力迫害。 滥用酷刑的现象非常普遍。 民间社会团体报告说有反对派的候选人被拘捕、为了政治目的而控制食品的供应以及对威胁选民的暴力事件比比皆是。 津巴布韦选举支持网络同样也对这个国家是否准备好迎接这场复杂的选举表示了担心。 这次选举将会选出总统、议会、参议员以及地方政府。 更别提继续阻碍政治进程的结构性缺陷了，包括有缺陷的宪法、受到严格审查的媒体以及党派的安全和军事力量了。 但是情况并非没有机会改变。 过去的一年我们看到一个又一个的机会从我们的身边溜走了。 南非总统姆贝基召集津巴布韦的政治团体进行和谈，但是如此没有成果以致最近反对派领导人一致指责姆贝基在和谈进程的问题对世界撒了谎。 一些非洲领导人，主要的有加纳总统库福尔和现任非盟主席科纳雷试图劝说穆加贝进行改革，但是都无功而返。 也许更重要的是，国际社会没能站出来讨论如何处理津巴布韦的问题再一次严重地显示了它缺乏制止可预见的危机的政治意愿。 去年，联合国秘书长潘基文和联合国人权事务高级代表阿尔布尔严厉指责该国政府使用酷刑以及虐待民主力量。 令人遗憾的是联合国没有采取进一步的行动。 联合国也许会说它必须得到一个国家的邀请才能采取某种形式的行动，比如派遣官方选举观察员。 但是我们应该清楚，只要有足够的政治意愿，联合国安理会完全能够遵守它对津巴布韦人民的责任而对危机做出更为强有力的回应。 联合国应该通过公开宣称愿意帮助津巴布韦准备一场受到国际监督的选举而迫使穆加贝采取守势。 然而恰恰相反，联合国依然听任穆加贝为所欲为，他一面宣称主权不可侵犯，一面却在国内大肆拘捕手无寸铁的平民。 面对有这么多人的生命处于危险之中的状况，我们可以采取怎样的措施阻止津巴布韦的危机进一步恶化呢？ 全世界有良好意愿的人，包括那些在像联合国这样的多边组织工作的人，应该亲临津巴布韦观察这个月的大选。 不管有没有得到官方认可，他们都应该在这个关键时刻与津巴布韦的人民站在一起，作为不断恶化的选前环境的见证人，以及成为抵御投票期间和之后可能出现的任何国家暴力的升级的堡垒。 穆加贝肯定希望把国际观察员的存在限制在由他的那些邻国派遣的范围，那些邻国在过去七年那些充斥着暴力和欺骗性的选举说成是“合法的 ” 。 津巴布韦的邻国同样面临着一个抉择：它们可以利用它们的邻国地位制止穆加贝滥用暴力，也可以保护他免受国际监督和指责。 它们的选择也许取决于国际社会对他们提出怎样的要求。 津巴布韦人民在3月29日这一天做出他们的选择。 对于地区和国际社会来说，它们今天以及在接下来数周的行动将决定这里是否会重复肯尼亚的暴乱，还是朝一个更稳定和民主的未来迈出第一步。"

            "Zimbabwe’s Permanent Guantánamo JOHANNESBURG – Last week, the United States Supreme Court ruled that detainees at Guantánamo Bay have the right to habeas corpus – the right to challenge the factual and legal basis of their detention in a court of law. I was elated by the decision, having spent four years working on ensuring the rule of law in US detention and interrogation policy, including monitoring military commission trials at Guantánamo Bay. But my happiness is tempered by where I sit, close to the border with Zimbabwe – a country where the writ of habeas corpus and the rule of law have become obsolete. Habeas corpus, Latin for “you have the body,” is an old English common law principle incorporated into the US Constitution to ensure freedom from unlawful detention by the state. It was and continues to be a critical check against the imprisonment of individuals without oversight by independent courts. In Zimbabwe, this right – like so many other checks and balances – has been torn away by a repressive state. Just hours before the US Supreme Court ruling, Tendai Biti, the Secretary-General of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), was arrested upon his return to Zimbabwe. Despite immediate attempts by his lawyers to locate him, his whereabouts remained unknown for days. The police dismissed an initial court order demanding that Biti be produced before the court. After Biti was finally produced before the court days later, the government announced that he will be charged with treason – which carries the death penalty – for unofficially announcing the results of the March 29, 2008, elections. Prior to his detention, Biti had responded to such allegations by stating that his only crime was to fight for democracy in Zimbabwe. It is unlikely that he will be able to challenge the basis of his detention in an independent court. Since 1999, the MDC has offered a democratic alternative to President Robert Mugabe’s regime. In the most recent elections, Zimbabweans made their choice known, despite serious obstacles and widespread repression, with the MDC’s presidential candidate, Morgan Tsvangirai, gaining more votes than Mugabe. But, according to the vote counts released by the government after a suspicious month-long delay, the MDC’s margin of victory – 48% to 43% – fell short of the 50% required to avoid a run-off election. Biti is not the only MDC member to be “disappeared” for a period of time by Mugabe’s government. Over the past two years, police and government-supported paramilitaries have routinely jailed, beaten, and even killed MDC officials and suspected MDC members. Last year, Biti was detained and beaten along with Tsvangirai and dozens of other MDC officials. The photos of Tsvangirai’s pummeled body led to an international outcry. State-sponsored violence against the MDC and its supporters has escalated as the June 27 run-off vote draws near. Just weeks ago, Biti described the discovery of the mutilated body of Tonderai Ndira, an MDC youth leader. Ndira had been taken by the police from his home. He was missing for seven days; when his body was found, it was recognizable only by a bracelet he always wore. Here in our offices in Johannesburg, we have two Zimbabwean lawyers who fled their country after receiving death threats for their work defending human rights. At least five of their clients have been murdered in the past few weeks. Most recently, the Zimbabwean police suspended the work of numerous human rights organizations that were documenting the recent violence. It is hard to imagine that a free and fair election can take place against the backdrop of such intense and systemic violence. Indeed, even South African president Thabo Mbeki, who, despite an outcry from many of his citizens, has supported Mugabe, felt compelled to label it a “cause for serious concern.” In the majority opinion in Boumediene v. Bush , Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote that “Liberty and security can be reconciled; and in our system they are reconciled within the framework of the law.” But there is no rule of law left in Zimbabwe – no habeas corpus and no check on arbitrary state action. It is time for the international community to step in, call for an end to the detention and disappearance of MDC officials and perceived supporters, and push for a democratic transition in Zimbabwe. Only then can the principles underlying the Supreme Court’s decision come within reach of ordinary Zimbabweans.",
            "津巴布韦的永久性关塔纳摩 约翰内斯堡 - - 美国最高法院上周裁决，关塔纳摩湾的被拘押人员具有人身保护权，也就是他们有权在法院对其关押的事实和法律基础提出质疑。 听到这一消息我兴奋不已。 我在过去四年时间里一直奔波，为的是确保美国的关押和审讯政策符合法治，包括监督关塔纳摩湾的军事审判。 但是，我现在身处津巴布韦边境，兴奋大为减少，因为这一国家的人身保护法令和法治遭到了践踏。 拉丁文中的“人身保护”是英国习惯法的一个古老原则。 美国宪法吸纳了这一原则来确保人身自由不受国家的非法压制。 它曾经是对在没有独立法院监督下拘禁人身的一个重要制衡，而且也将继续如此。 在津巴布韦，这一权利如同其他许多制衡机制一样已经被专制国家所撕毁。 在美国最高法院做出裁决前几个小时，反对派民主变革运动秘书长彼迪在返回津巴布韦的时候被捕。 尽管他的律师马上就开始寻找他，但是还是连续几天不知下落。 警方拒绝了法院最初要求把彼迪交付法院的命令。 几天后彼迪终于出现在法庭，政府宣布将指控他犯有可判处死刑的叛国罪行，原因是他私自宣布2008年3月29日的选举结果。 在他被拘禁以前，彼迪回应这些指控说，他唯一的罪行就是在津巴布韦争取民主。 他不大可能会在独立法庭质疑对其实行拘押的理由。 从1999年以来，民主变革运动对穆加贝总统政权提出了民主性的代替选择。 在最近的选举中，津巴布韦人们表达了他们的选择。 尽管存在严重阻碍和大规模压制，民主变革运动的总统侯选人茨万吉拉伊获得的选票超过穆加贝。 但是，在经过一个月令人怀疑的耽搁后，政府公布投票结果，民主变革运动获得48%对43%的胜利，低于规定的50 % ， 从而必须进行再次投票。 彼迪并不是唯一在穆加贝政府统治时期“消失”的民主变革运动成员。 在过去两年的时间里，警察和政府支持的准军事部队时常拘押、殴打甚至杀害民主变革运动官员以及被怀疑是该运动的成员。 去年，彼迪和茨万吉拉伊以及其他十几个民主变革运动官员一同被拘押和遭到殴打。 茨万吉拉伊遭到殴打的照片引发了国际社会的强烈抗议。 随着6月27日再次投票的临近，针对民主变革运动及其支持者的由国家支持的暴力行为升级了。 仅仅在几个星期以前，彼迪讲述发现了民主变革运动青年领导人尼拉被肢解的尸体。 尼拉在家中被警察带走。 他失踪七天。 当他的尸体被发现的时候，人们只能从他总是戴着的手镯辨认出来。 在我们位于约翰内斯堡的办事处里有两位津巴布韦律师。 他们由于维护人权的工作而收到了死亡威胁，逃离了他们的国家。 至少有五名他们的客户在过去两周内被谋杀。 最近，津巴布韦警察中止了众多记录最近暴力事件的人权组织的工作。 很难想像在这样一种紧张而又系统化的暴力背景下可以举行自由公正的选举。 南非总统姆贝基过去不顾其人民的强烈反对支持穆加贝。 实际上连他也感到不得不把这一事态称为“令人严重关切 ” 。 美国最高法院法官肯尼迪在其布梅迪艾内诉布什一案中的多数意见中写到 ： “ 自由和安全可以两全；在美国的体制中这二者在法律的框架内得以两全 ” 。 但是津巴布韦已经没有了法治，没有了人身保护，也没有了对专制国家行为的制衡。 现在国际社会应该干预，呼吁结束拘押民主变革运动官员及其支持者及其消亡，并且推动津巴布韦的民主转型。 只有这样，普通津巴布韦人民才会享有最高法院决定中的原则基础。"

            "Zoellick to the Rescue? Will newly anointed World Bank President Robert Zoellick be able to get the organization back on its feet after the catastrophic failed presidency of Paul Wolfowitz? Although hardly a megawatt star of the Bob Rubin category, he certainly brings some positive attributes to the job. First, as a key player in bringing China into the World Trade Organization, Zoellick is a proven internationalist in an American administration where internationalists have sometimes seemed like an endangered species. Second, he is a firm believer in the power of markets and free trade, which have clearly done far more to alleviate poverty over the past half-century than any aid program. Third, he seems to have been a consistent behind-the-scenes supporter of the Bank, whereas many of his Bush administration colleagues would be just as happy to see it shut down and its Washington headquarters turned into private condominiums and offices. So presumably he has a constructive vision for the Bank’s future. But Zoellick is not without his weaknesses. First and foremost, his appointment extends the embarrassingly outmoded practice of always installing an American in the job. With the Bank tirelessly preaching the merits of good governance, its failure to adopt democratic principles undercuts its own legitimacy. The claim that the World Bank needs an American president to ensure that the US keeps donating money is ridiculous. The annual cost of the US contribution to the World Bank, even taking into account off-the-books loan guarantees, is relatively minor. Any number of developing countries, from China to India to Brazil, could easily step up if the US foolishly stepped down. Zoellick’s background as a lawyer hardly makes him perfect for the job, either. The World Bank presidency is not about negotiating treaties, as Zoellick did when he was US Trade Representative. The Bank’s most important role in development today is as a “knowledge bank” that helps aggregate, distill, and disseminate best practices from around the world. In this respect, the Bank’s technical assistance to governments is very similar to what private consultants offer to companies. Moreover, many of the World Bank president’s most important decisions involve economics in an essential way. Wrong economic decisions, such as in the 1970’s, when Robert McNamara pushed grandiose, but environmentally devastating, infrastructure projects, have haunted the Bank for decades. The biggest question mark, though, is whether Zoellick will be able to hit the ground running and implement desperately needed reforms. Reform number one, of course, is to ensure that the next World Bank President is not an American. Rodrigo de Rato, Zoellick’s counterpart at the European-dominated International Monetary Fund, has already suggested that his successor should be chosen in a more inclusive process. The World Bank should be ashamed that its president has not yet offered a similar proposal. Second, Zoellick should ask why the Bank spends only 2.5% of its budget on the “knowledge bank” research function that it trumpets so proudly in its external relations materials, while it spends three times that amount on maintaining its executive board. Third, Zoellick should use his formidable negotiating skills to cajole rich countries into greatly increasing the grant component of World Bank aid. The idea that a big government-guaranteed global bank is needed to fill holes in private capital markets is laughable nowadays. True, the Bank’s poorest clients have little access to private capital markets. By and large, however, the poorest countries need grants, not loans that they still won’t be able to pay in 20 years. As the Bank switches from loans to grants, it can use some of its massive retained earnings to endow its “knowledge bank” function and related technical advice. But all this knowledge shouldn’t be free. A lot of technical advice falls on deaf ears, with countries listening only long enough to get their hands on Bank money. Instead of merely pushing its agenda, the Bank should start charging for its technical advice on a graduated scale so that more of its engagements are client-driven. Last but not least, the Bank needs to play a much bigger role in environmental issues and, in general, in promoting good international citizenship by both rich and poor countries. (Some of us have been proposing this for almost two decades.) Of course, Zoellick could just attempt to fill the role symbolically and do little or nothing, as some of his predecessors have done. Or, less likely, he could embrace some megalomaniacal and over-reaching vision of government intervention, as others have tried. In any case, let’s wish him luck. The world needs the World Bank a lot more than it needs another condominium.",
            "佐利克能否力挽狂澜？ 沃尔福威茨铩羽而归，刚刚获得任命的行长佐利克能否收拾世界银行的残局？ 尽管佐利克无法与明星级的鲁宾相提并论，但是他肯定给这一职位带来了某些积极的特点。 首先，佐利克是将中国带入世界贸易组织的关键人物。 在布什政府中，国际主义者有时候看起来像是濒危物种，而佐利克就是一位确定无疑的国际主义者。 第二，他坚信市场和自由贸易的力量，而这两者在过去本个世纪中在减轻贫困上发挥的作用明显要比任何援助项目都大。 第三，他看起来好像是世界银行一贯的幕后支持者，而他的布什政府中的许多同僚巴不得把世界银行关闭，把银行的华盛顿总部改造成私人公寓和办公室。 所以他理应对银行的未来具有建设性的远见。 但是佐利克也并非完人。 最为重要的是，这一任命延续了总是把一个美国人安插在这一位置上的令人难堪的过时做法。 尽管世界银行不知疲倦地宣扬良好管理价值，但是它不采纳民主原则却破坏了它自身的合法性。 那种宣称世界银行需要一个美国人担任行长来确保美国继续捐款的说法是荒谬的。 美国给世界银行的年度捐款即使加上不在册的贷款保证也是相对少的。 如果美国愚蠢地退出，从中国、印度到巴西的任何发展中国家都可以轻松地增加拨款。 而且，佐利克的律师背景也很难让他成为完美的人选。 世界银行行长并不是像佐利克担任美国贸易代表那样谈判条约。 世行在当今发展中最为重要的作用是作为一个“知识银行”帮助在全世界增加、提炼和传播最佳实务。 在这一方面，世行给各国政府的技术援助与私人顾问提供给公司的很相像。 而且，世行行长许多最为重要的决定在很大程度上都是与经济学有关。 在七十年代，麦克拉马拉推动了许多规模宏大但造成环境灾难的基础设施项目。 这样的错误经济决定几十年来一直困扰着世行。 但是，最大的问题是佐利克能否旗开得胜并落实急需的改革措施。 首要改革当然就是要确保下一个世界银行行长不是美国人。 由欧洲人掌控的国际货币基金组织总裁、也是佐利克的对手拉托已经表明他的继任人应当从更为包容的进程中挑选。 世界银行行长如果还没有提出一个类似的提议，那么世行就应该感到羞愧。 第二，佐利克应当问一下，为什么世行在其对外宣传资料中大肆宣扬的“知识银行”研究功能只有2.5％的预算，而维持其执行委员会的数量却是它的三倍。 第三，佐利克应当运用他娴熟的谈判技巧来劝说富国大幅度增加世行援助的赠款部分。 需要由一个庞大的、由政府担保的全球性银行来填补私人资本市场的漏洞这一想法在今天看来是可笑的。 的确，世行最穷的客户们基本上无法得到私人资本市场的资金。 但是，总体而言，最穷的国家需要的是赠款，而不是它们所无法在20年中偿还的贷款。 在世行从贷款转为赠款的时候，它可以使用其巨大的保留收益来为其“知识银行”功能和相关的技术建议提供资金。 但是所有的这些建议都不应当是免费的。 许多技术建议被置若罔闻，许多国家为了获得世行的款项才洗耳恭听。 世行不能仅仅推动它的议程，而是应该开始对它的技术建议按照渐进标准收取费用，这样，它的更多的项目才会是以客户为导向的。 最后一点但不是最次要的一点就是，世行需要在环境问题和在总体上来说在穷国和富国中促进良好的国际公民项目上发挥更大的作用。 （我们有些人已经提议几乎二十年了。 ） 当然，佐利克可以像他的许多前任那样做表面文章或者干脆无所作为。 或者，他也可以像其他人那样采取某些狂妄自大而又过度庞大的政府干预规划。 无论如何，让我们祝他好运。 世界需要世界银行，远远要超过世界银行需要另一个公寓。"

            "Zuma Rising The anxiety over Jacob Zuma’s election as president of South Africa obscures a significant milestone: for the first time in decades, a sub-Saharan nation has at its helm a champion of ordinary people. African politics has long been the exclusive domain of aristocrats, soldiers, and technocrats. Even with the spread of democratic elections, the region’s leaders tend to come from the ranks of soldiers (Uganda, Rwanda, Zimbabwe), family dynasties (Togo, Kenya, etc), or university professors, lawyers, and economists (Ghana, Malawi, Liberia). Now South Africa, the region’s economic engine and home to its most sophisticated universities, media, and corporations, has a former goat herder at its helm, a rare African leader with the common touch. He’s secure enough to dance and sing in public. He speaks the language of populism, raising hopes for the vast majority of South Africans who daily endure the misery of poor housing, schools, and health care. In contrast to his two predecessors – the saintly Nelson Mandela, who emphasized racial healing, and the aristocratic Thabo Mbeki, who reassured financiers with his strong grasp of macroeconomics – Zuma recognizes the pent-up demand for material improvement in the lives of his country’s tens of millions of have-nots. “We have learned from the mistakes of the past 15 years, especially the manner of which we may have, to some degree, neglected the people’s movement,” he said in April, before his African National Congress swept to victory. Until now, populism has been the missing note in African political culture. Zuma, who spent his youth herding cattle and only gained formal education while in the notorious Robben Island prison with Mandela, is refreshingly aware that Africa’s biggest problem is its inequalities, not its global marginalization. In Africa’s wealthiest nation – but also the nation where wealth is most unequally shared – a bold populist now holds ultimate power over government policy. Yet, while Zuma’s populist appeal reflects South Africa’s especially large differences in economic class, the threat of imposing higher taxes and other obligations on employers and the wealthy has raised fears at home and internationally. Moreover, Zuma has been called a chameleon, accused of telling his audiences what they want to hear. Zuma’s turbulent personal life – many wives and his embarrassing contention during a rape trial that he avoided HIV infection by taking a shower – has invited ridicule. Most seriously, doubts persist about his commitment to democracy, with critics arguing he’s an old-style African “big man” ready to bully opponents and ravage the public coffers with his cronies. Dismissing complaints, Zuma insists, “There’s no cloud around me.” His defenders, meanwhile, point to two benefits that he has already delivered: an end to Mbeki’s ambivalent approach to fighting HIV/AIDS, the country’s major public health threat, and a refreshing willingness to move against Zimbabwe’s aged dictator, Robert Mugabe, whom Mbeki coddled out of a misguided sense of loyalty for his support during the struggle against apartheid. In an Africa bereft of successful populist politicians, Zuma’s role models may come from Latin America, where income inequality is also extreme and the trade-union movement, as in South Africa, is strong and militant. With enormous pressure from ordinary people to deliver tangible gains, Zuma the populist will quickly face a major test: will he emulate Lula of Brazil, who has struck an admirable balance between good economic governance and re-distribution of wealth to the poor? Or will he follow the path of Hugo Chávez, a popular autocrat who seems to prefer building a cult of personality over raising living standards for the poor. The stakes for Africa are enormous. South Africa has the continent’s largest economy and, until the global financial crisis, posted 10 years of steady economic growth. In an economic slowdown, the country’s severe crime problem might only worsen; so might unemployment, which already tops 20% in the formal economy. Zuma senses the urgency of the situation. He is, after all, 67 years old and likely to serve only a single term in office. “We can’t waste time,” he says. Yet, according to the political economist Moeletsi Mbeki, at his core, “Zuma is a conservative.” In this sense, Zuma represents yesterday’s South Africa. He is part of the proud generation that defeated apartheid – and then peacefully engineered a transition to durable black-majority rule. Their achievement remains one of the greatest in recent history. At the same time, Zuma’s revolutionary generation still seems uneasy leading South Africa in a post-apartheid era that is now 15 years old. In a region that reveres the elderly, Zuma’s attachment to his rural traditions must be matched by an equal openness to the appetites of the country’s youth. Three in ten South Africans are younger than 15, meaning that they did not live a day under apartheid. Somehow Zuma must find a way to honor his own generation’s commitment to racial justice and national liberation, while empowering the masses who daily suffer the sting of class differences and yearn for material gain.",
            "祖马胜出 有些人对祖马当选南非总统的担忧，使一个重要的具有里程碑式意义的事件 — — 几十年来的第一次，一个撒哈拉以南非洲国家将会由一个支持平民大众的人当领导人 — — 蒙上了阴影。 非洲政治长期以来都是贵族、军人和专家政治家的专属领域。 即使随着民主选举的发展，撒哈拉以南非洲国家的领导人一般也都是军人（例如乌干达、卢旺达和津巴布韦的领导人 ） ， 家族王朝（例如多哥、肯尼亚等国的领导人 ） ， 或者大学教授、律师和经济学家（例如加纳、马拉维、利比里亚的领导人）出身。 现在，作为撒哈拉以南非洲国家经济引擎和最先进的大学、媒体以及公司所在地的南非，拥有了一位曾经当过牧羊人的领导人 — — 一位罕见的具有平易近人品质的非洲领导人。 祖马在和普通民众打成一片方面具有超凡的能力，他在公开场合唱歌跳舞都很轻松自如，他用普通大众的语言进行演说，他为广大每天忍受恶劣的居住、教育和医疗条件的南非人带来了希望。 祖马和他的两位前任 — — 强调种族愈合的品德高尚的尼尔森·曼德拉和通过对宏观经济强有力的把握打消金融家顾虑的贵族化的塔博·姆贝基 — — 不同，他认识到了南非几千万穷人被抑制的改善物质生活条件的需求。 “我们已经从过去15年的错误中，特别是从在某种程度上忽略了人民运动的错误中，吸取了教训 。 ” 他在四月份于非洲国民大会党横扫对手取得胜利之前，如是说。 直到现在，非洲政治文化中仍然缺乏平民主义的观念。 祖马的青年时代是在放牧中度过的，他直到和曼德拉一起被关押在了臭名昭著的罗宾岛（Robben Island）监狱之后，才接受正式的教育的；祖马清醒地认识到，非洲最大的问题是不平等问题，而不是在世界上被边缘化了的问题。 在非洲最富裕的国家，但是也是财富分配最不公平的国家 — — 南非，一个大胆的平民主义者现在对政府政策拥有了最终决策的权力了。 然而，虽然祖马的平民主义吸引力反映了南非特别巨大的经济阶层差异，但是，他扬言要对雇主和富人征收更高的税赋和施加其他的义务，已经在南非国内外引起了人们的担心。 而且，还有人将祖马称为变色龙，指责他总是向听众讲他们想听的东西。 祖马混乱的私生活 — — 他有多位妻子，以及他在一起强奸审判中说他通过淋浴避免艾滋病病毒的令人尴尬的辩解 — — 已经引起了一些人的嘲笑。 更严重的是，有人对他的民主承诺一直持怀疑态度，也有批评家批评他是一个老式的非洲“专制人物 ” ， 认为他会威吓对手并与其亲信一起侵占公共财产。 为了驳斥这些批评，祖马坚称 ， “ 我是光明正大的 。 ” 同时，他的支持者也向人们指出了两个他已经承诺过的好处：结束姆贝基对抗南非主要的公共健康威胁 — — 艾滋病病毒/艾滋病 — — 的充满矛盾的做法，用行动反对津巴布韦年迈的独裁者罗伯特·穆加贝的全新观点 — — 对于罗伯特·穆加贝，姆贝基因为其在南非反对种族隔离制度时期给予反种族隔离制度人士的支持而对其产生了具有误导性的信任，因而纵容他的独裁统治。 在缺乏成功的平民主义政治家的非洲，祖马的行为榜样可能来源于拉丁美洲。 在拉丁美洲，收入不平等问题也是极端严重的，而且，工会运动和南非一样，非常强大而好战。 因为来自普通民众要求给予切实好处的巨大压力，平民主义者祖马很快就会面临一个重大考验：他是效仿巴西的卢拉，在良好的经济治理和将财富重新分配给穷人间取得令人钦佩的平衡呢？ 还是会走上一条雨果·查韦斯式的道路，做一个受欢迎的独裁者，和提高穷人的生活水平相比，更愿意建立起个人崇拜呢？ 这对非洲厉害攸关。 南非是非洲最大的经济体，并且，在经济危机爆发之前的十年里，经济稳定增长。 在经济低迷时期，南非严重的犯罪问题肯定会恶化；而且，已经在正式经济体中占前20%的失业问题，也会恶化。 祖马意识到了问题的紧迫性。 毕竟，他已经67岁了，不大可能会连任。 他说 ， “ 我们不能浪费时间 。 ” 然而，根据政治经济学家莫莱茨·姆贝基(Moeletsi Mbeki)的观点，在本质上 ， “ 祖马是一个保守主义者 。 ” 在这个意义上，祖马代表的是过去的南非。 他是打败种族隔离制度 — — 然后让南非和平过渡到由人口占多数的黑人进行长期统治 — — 的自豪的一代人的一部分。 这一代人的成就是现代��史上最伟大的成就之一。 同时，祖马革命的一代似乎对领导打破种族隔离制度15年后的南非，还不适应。 在一个尊敬老人的地区，祖马对其乡下传统的依恋，必须和对南非年青人的爱好所持的平等而开放态度相平衡。 在南非，每10个人中就有三个人的年龄小于15岁，这意味着，这些人从来没有在种族隔离制度下生活过。 在某种程度上，祖马在给予那些心灵每天都会被阶层差异刺痛以及渴望物质利益的广大民众权利的同时，他还必须找到一个实践自己那一代人所作的种族公正和民族解放承诺的途径。"
